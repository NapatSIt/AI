Abstract
"Recently, the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth in multi-modal communication systems requires a paradigm shift. Powered by deep learning, semantic communications are applied to multi-modal scenarios to boost communication efficiency and save communication resources. However, the existing end-to-end neural network (NN) based framework without the channel encoder/decoder is incompatible with modern digital communication systems. Moreover, most end-to-end designs are task-specific and require re-design and re-training for new tasks, which limits their applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-modal semantic communication framework incorporating the conventional channel encoder/decoder. We adopt NN-based semantic encoder and decoder to extract correlated semantic information contained in different modalities, including speech, text, and image. Based on the proposed framework, we further establish a general rate-adaptive coding mechanism for various types of multi-modal semantic tasks. In particular, we utilize unequal error protection based on semantic importance, which is derived by evaluating the distortion bound of each modality. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that aims at minimizing inference delay while maintaining inference accuracy for semantic tasks. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism fares better than both conventional communication and existing semantic communication systems in terms of task performance, inference delay, and deployment complexity.

"Background: Pharmacists have the potential to improve care for marginalized populations. Stigmatized and racialized groups may not find traditional health services accessible in other settings. Research focused on health care access for these populations is fundamental in understanding how to improve health equity. Objectives: This scoping review aimed to determine how health equity is addressed within services offered through community pharmacies for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods: This scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist. A comprehensive search strategy was developed with an academic librarian to capture studies containing search terms related to each of the following 3 topics: STIs, pharmacy, and underserved groups. PubMed and Embase were both searched up to July 2023 and search results were uploaded to the screening software Covidence. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Articles were included if they reported evaluation of a pharmacy-based sexual health service and addressed health equity in service design or implementation. Results: A total of 8 articles were identified that described services implemented for underserved groups. Four populations were identified: injection drug users, men who have sex with men, racial minorities, and those with low socioeconomic status. Equity was addressed through 2 mechanisms: location-based implementation of services in areas of high target population density or through specific targeting of marginalized populations in recruitment and promotion. All studies involved interventions for the prevention or testing services rather than assessment and treatment. Conclusions: Equity is not being readily addressed in pharmacy-based services for STIs yet evidence exists that considering equity in the design and implementation of services may improve reach to underserved populations. © 2023 American Pharmacists Association®"
"Higher education is rapidly growing in the online learning landscape. However, current personalized recommendation techniques struggle with precise extraction of complex mathematical semantics, hindering accurate perception of learners&#x0027; cognitive states and relevance of recommendations. This paper proposes a framework for extracting complex mathematical semantics and providing personalized exercise recommendations. We design a tree-based position encoding method to enhance the accuracy of positional representation for mathematical expressions in pre-trained model, aiming to improve the performance of downstream tasks. We propose an automatic method for extracting knowledge attributes based on expert annotations, enabling interpretable cognitive diagnosis. Furthermore, we employ sequential pattern mining to discover the knowledge usage patterns in exercises, generate learning paths using a multi-layer knowledge graph, and leverage cognitive diagnostic results to enhance the relevance of recommendations. Experimental results show a 2.0&#x0025; improvement in mathematical symbol embedding on mathematical formula retrieval tasks, and knowledge attribute extraction accuracy ranging from 66.5&#x0025; to 81.7&#x0025;. Learners&#x0027; post-test scores significantly improve during group testing, with good consistency between online cognitive diagnosis and self-diagnosis. IEEE"

"Roadmapping emerged in technology-based businesses to foster the alignment between strategic objectives and new products and technologies. Along with roadmapping, ICT tools, software, and data processing techniques have been used to make it more effective and efficient. Despite the advance of digital technologies, there needs to be more clarity regarding their usage and impacts on roadmapping implementation. Thus, this article aims to perform a systematic literature review focusing on these digital tools supporting the roadmapping process. It combines bibliometric and content analysis to address a sample of 61 articles. The results indicate that text mining has been widely explored in the roadmapping preparation stage, while digital tools focused on collaborative roadmapping activities have gained less prominence. This work&#x0027;s main contributions are mapping the roadmapping digital tools and their interaction with each activity in the process. Besides, some research topics are highlighted as a future agenda for roadmapping assisted by digital tools. IEEE"
"People's perspectives can be found on various platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube, as a result of the recent rise of social media as a significant means of education and communication. This research makes use of a dataset obtained from Twitter that contains 700 posts discussing various aspects of investment education. Natural language processing tasks, including text analysis, have benefited greatly from machine learning and deep learning approaches due to their adaptability, effectiveness, and promise. We adapted the knowledge of native and linguistic experts in Indonesian language to manually confirmed whether a tweet is Positive or Negative. Manual annotation and text/emotion analysis have both seen extensive application of machine learning techniques. One model of learning model SVM as base learner has also demonstrated great classification accuracy, and its different kernels have been utilized for sentiment categorization. To effectively create and test the learner, we used fastText and Multilingual Sentence BERT, the two methods of feature extraction. All of the SVM learners with different kinds of kernels have been tested in terms of key performance indicators such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. In our experiment, SVM with Polynomial kernel acquired the greatest accuracy of 98.1%.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The current metaverse trend has been transcended by a multitude of technologies, among which is artificial intelligence. AI technology is fundamental for the metaverse in many ways, following its sub-areas of application and the various application domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for the medical metaverse supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a more effective and confident remote patient monitoring system. We aim to explore the various possibilities of handling medical processes such as consultation, treatment, and others using the metaverse assisted by NLP. For this reason, we propose an approach involving text and sound analysis in a virtual context that can show a more immersive experience, thus enabling high-level interactivity between a patient and a doctor. In this research, we propose a general-purpose model for our approach with applications for a consultation and treatment protocol. Implementing this approach will lead to a more advanced and reliable patient monitoring system in which patients and doctors will have trust and confidence due to the immersive experience created by the metaverse.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In the last decade, the fast technological and social transformations have been placing new demands on Higher Education (HE) systems to update their educational offers. Grounded in the broader discourse on the impact of such transformation on HE, this article relies on Text Mining (TM). We consider as a case study the Italian HE system, providing an overview of the university education in the last 10 Academic Years. We automatically analyse 54,535 learning outcomes of degree programmes to identify the relevant topics with Named Entity Recognition, a technique of TM. For each topic, we measured its trend in time and coverage on a geographical basis and in the disciplinary fields. We detected 6062 different topics, among these the most growing are artificial intelligence, sustainability, rare diseases, and ethics. The findings reveal that topics related to hard sciences register higher occurrence than the ones concerning humanities and social sciences. Furthermore, we observed that universities are overcoming the boundaries of disciplinary fields, promoting knowledge contamination and vertical specialisation. The proposed approach can advance studies in HE literature for effective and efficient analysis. The findings can inform policies and practices in HE on evolving learning outcomes and educational offerings, even across different countries and disciplines. © 2023 Society for Research into Higher Education."
"With the need of social and economic development, the audit method is also continuously reformed and improved. Traditional audit methods have defects of comprehensively considering various risk factors, and cannot meet the needs of enterprise financial work. To improve the effectiveness of audit work and meet the financial needs of enterprises, a solution for intelligent auditing of enterprise finance is proposed, including intelligent analysis of accounting vouchers and of audit reports. Then, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network is used to classify the audit problems under three text feature extraction methods. The test results show that the accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value of the COWORDS-IOM algorithm in the aggregate clustering of accounting vouchers are 85.12, 83.28, and 84.85%, respectively, which are better than the self-organizing map algorithm before the improvement. The accuracy rate, recall rate, and F1 value of Word2vec TF-IDF LDA-BiLSTM model for intelligent analysis of audit reports are 87.43, 87.88, and 87.66%, respectively. This shows that the proposed method has good performance in accounting voucher clustering and intelligent analysis of audit reports, which can provide guidance for the development of enterprise financial intelligence software to a certain extent. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."
"In the realm of Document Image Analysis (DIA), the primary objective is to transform image data into a format that can be readily interpreted by machines. Within a DIA-based system, layout analysis plays a crucial role in pre-processing, for the identification and extraction of precise and error-free textual segments. However, regarding the Pashto language, the document images are not explored so far. Pashto text detection in camera-captured documents is a challenging task due to variations in image quality, lighting conditions, complex backgrounds unavailability of labeled documents, cursiveness, shape-context dependency, multi scripts per image, and language-specific layouts. This research examines the case of Pashto and Arabic text and contributes in two aspects. First, it introduces the creation of a real dataset that contains 1080 images of the Pashto documents captured by a handheld camera. Second, this work examines deep learning based classifiers that can perform layout analysis tasks and detects Pashto and Arabic text per document. For the layout classification, we used deep learning models such as Single-Shot Detector (SSD), Yolov5 and Yolov7. A baseline results are achieved by examining 30% images as a test set and achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 84.51% on SSD, 88.50% on Yolov5 and 91.30% on Yolov7 respectively. The proposed methods have the potential to contribute to various applications, such as document analysis, information retrieval, and translation, for Pashto and Arabic language users. Authors"
"Aristotle’s Categories were translated into Armenian around the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth cent. CE. The first text of the Organon was transmitted alongside an anonymous commentary from which it cannot be separated. This commentary, probably a translation from Greek to Armenian, has escaped the attention of most researchers of Aristotelian philosophy in the French-speaking world due to the lack of a proper translation and a philosophical comparative study. The following article aims to offer for the first time a French translation of the Armenian commentary, more precisely of the exegesis of the Cat. 1 a 1 - 1 b 24 (Antepraedicamenta), as well as a comparative analysis of its content. The analysis will reveal that the anonymous commentary was probably written between the third and sixth centuries by a Greek-speaking commentator who was more influenced by the exegesis of Alexander of Aphrodisias than by the one of the various members of the Neoplatonic school of Rome, Athens or Alexandria. © Copyright 2023 Pisa University Press Polo editoriale CIDIC."
"VANČO, Dominik: The Image of Methodius as a Literary Character in Slovak Prose. The aim of the article is to examine the image of Methodius as a literary character in the main literary texts of Slovak prose, which are thematically focused on the period of Great Moravia. We work with texts by three authors, namely J. M. Hurban: Svadba kráľa veľkomoravského (1842); M. Ferko: Svätopluk (1975) and Svätopluk a Metod (1985); F. Rábek: Tajomstvo Zoborského kláštora (2019). We use the techniques of text analysis, interpretation and comparison. Using eight criteria, we observe in what ways the mentioned authors’ approaches in a connection to the reflection of Methodius coincide and in what ways they differ. Our attention is focused on the following aspects: the time span of the plot, character traits, character development and psychologization, the relationship between Methodius and Svätopluk, Methodius‘ disputes with the Frankish bishops, the role of Methodius in the spread of Christianity in Bohemia, the role of Methodius in the literary text and intertextuality in a relation to medieval texts. Despite certain differences, a positive character image of Methodius dominates in Slovak prosaic texts – it varies between mythicization, demythicization and glorification. The most plastic portrayal of the character of Methodius can be observed in the novels of M. Ferko. Authors of modern literary texts preserve the idea of Methodius as a saint, which has been handed down since the Middle Ages. © 2023 Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra.

"BACKGROUND: Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) is a severe extrapulmonary TB, which can lead to serious complications. Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for the prognosis and the diagnosis of abdominal TB is still difficult. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang database for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of NAATs for abdominal TB until August 2020. Any types of study design with full text were sought and included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Stata version 15.0 with the midas command packages was used to carry out meta-analyses. RESULTS: We included a total of 78 independent studies from 53 articles; 64 with CRS as the reference standard, and 14 with culture as the reference standard. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the areas under summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves (AUC) were 58% (51%-64%; I2 = 87%), 99% (97%-99%; I2 = 81%), and 0.92 (0.89-0.94) compared with CRS, respectively. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC values of the SROC were 80% (66%-90%; I2 = 56%), 96% (92%-98%; I2 = 84%), and 0.97 (0.95-0.98) compared with culture, respectively. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity was significant. CONCLUSIONS: NAATs had excellent efficacy in the diagnosis of abdominal TB regardless of the reference standard and regardless of the subtype of abdominal TB. Multiplex PCR with multiple target genes may improve diagnostic sensitivity, and stool specimens may also be used for the diagnosis of abdominal TB in addition to tissue and ascites.

"Cultural communication plays a vital role in social development and human interaction. Red culture, as an integral part of China&#x2019;s revolutionary history and socialist construction, holds significant meaning and exerts a wide influence. However, in the era of information technology, effectively disseminating red culture and stimulating public interest and participation has become an urgent challenge. In this study, we use the advanced deep learning tech to explore the use of multimodal data fusion for enhancing the effectiveness and impact of red culture communication. Specifically, we extract text features and image features from users&#x2019; browsing information using BI-GRU and CNN, respectively. These features are then fused with user portraits to create a multi-source information fusion vector. Subsequently, we employ a BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) to perform user interest classification based on the fused features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed user recognition framework achieves an average recognition rate of 95.4% across three types of users, indicating high accuracy. Therefore, the user interest classification model, incorporating fused multi-features, presented in this paper offers a promising approach for future red culture communication, as well as user intelligent recommendation and analysis.

"A database for the Iraqi Sorani Kurds, specifically focused on the 12 X-short tandem repeat (STR) loci, has been developed to fascilitate forensic and population genetics investigations. The present study involved genotyping 117 unrelated individuals from the Sorani Kurds ethnic group using the Investigator Argus X-12 QS kit. The analysis revealed that the DXS10135 locus exhibited the highest degree of polymorphism, as indicated by a polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.94565 and a gene diversity (GD) value of 0.95623. Conversely, the DXS8378 locus displayed the lowest level of polymorphism, with a PIC value of 0.61026 and a GD value of 0.68170. Notably, two individuals were found to possess a rare allele (allele = 6) at the DXS8378 locus, which was not included in the allelic ladder of the kit. Furthermore, a significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) (p < 0.05/117) was observed between the DXS10103 and DXS10101 loci on linkage group 3 (LG3). The ancestral composition of the five primary geographic regions, namely Africa, Middle East, East Asia, Europe, and South America, was determined through the utilization of the [Formula: see text] ratio. The findings of this analysis revealed that the Middle Eastern populations exhibited the lowest [Formula: see text] ratio, measuring at 0.23243, indicating a relatively lower ancestral diversity. Conversely, the European populations showcased the highest [Formula: see text] ratio, measuring at 0.27122, indicative of a greater ancestral diversity within this region. Additionally, the allelic richness indicators, namely distinctive and private alleles, indicated that Africa and the Middle East displayed the highest levels, while Far East Asia exhibited the lowest. This analysis supports the hypothesis of repeated founder effects during outward migrations, as evidenced by both the ancestry variability and the allelic richness. Consequently, the findings of this study have important implications for forensic genetics and population genetics research, particularly in relation to the consideration of genetic predispositions within specific ethnic groups.

"To investigate the advancements of artificial intelligence techniques in the realm of library and information subject, we have chosen the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method as a case study to explore its current study status and implementations. Traditional theme mining analyses utilize methods such as word frequency statistics, co-occurrence analysis, community detection, and citation analysis to capture external quantitative features of words or documents. In contrast, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation theme modelling method employs a three-layer Bayesian structure of document-topic-word to describe the themes of documents and the semantic relationships among words, enabling a better exploration of latent semantic information in text. This method plays a pivotal role in fine-grained knowledge extraction and analysis. We systematically review more than a decade of relevant literature in the realm about library and information subject. Through content analysis, we construct an analytical architecture for the implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method. This architecture, viewed from the perspective of the implementation process of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, comprehensively summarizes the core stages and technical challenges, including text pre-processing, model construction (i.e., theme model selection and optimal theme number determination), and model solving. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current study status of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method across various implementation domains, such as theme exploration, knowledge organization, academic evaluation, sentiment analysis, and recommendation study. Our findings indicate that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method has formed a mature analytical process in the realm of library and information subject, with ongoing growth in study interest.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The surge in legal text production has amplified the workload for legal professionals, making many tasks repetitive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the complexity and specialized language of legal documents pose challenges not just for those in the legal domain but also for the general public. This emphasizes the potential role and impact of Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal NLP). Although advancements have been made in this domain, particularly after 2015 with the advent of Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), a systematic exploration of this progress until 2022 is nonexistent. In this research, we perform a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to bridge this gap.We aim to provide a descriptive statistical analysis of the Legal NLP research between 2015 and 2022. Categorize and sub-categorize primary publications based on their research problems. Identify limitations and areas of improvement in current research. Using a robust search methodology across four reputable indexers, we filtered 536 papers down to 75 pivotal articles. Our findings reveal the diverse methods employed for tasks such as Multiclass Classification, Summarization, and Question Answering in the Legal NLP field.We also highlight resources, challenges, and gaps in current methodologies and emphasize the need for curated datasets, ontologies, and a focus on inherent difficulties like data accessibility. As the legal sector gradually embraces Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the capabilities and limitations of Legal NLP becomes vital for ensuring efficient and ethical application. The research offers insights for both Legal NLP researchers and the broader legal community, advocating for continued advancements in automation while also addressing ethical concerns. Authors"
"Research in the field of data mining, especially text-based, is growing with the discovery of new methods that have good performance. Sentiment analysis is a field of research that is still widely studied in text classification. Various approaches, including Machine Learning, have been tried in sentiment analysis research, but as the dataset grows, these methods do not produce optimal accuracy performance. The Deep Learning method is a solution that is often used by researchers to produce maximum performance on large datasets, but in some studies, if the number of datasets is limited, the training model cannot be carried out optimally. As a solution, data augmentation is an approach that can be used to increase the quantity of datasets so as to encourage better performance of a model. This study uses a sentiment analysis dataset regarding various films on Twitter, but with a limited amount of data, so a data augmentation approach is needed to increase the quantity. Text-based data augmentation techniques combined with the Deep Learning approach, namely the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) methods are the approaches we propose in this study. RNN LSTM has the ability to Handling Long-Term Dependencies and Effective in Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks so that the performance of the model on the sentiment analysist will be more optimal The results show that the proposed model has succeeded in classifying the sentiment analysis dataset for film reviews by showing a model accuracy rate of 70.45%.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Climate change is one of the most important global topics of public interest. Consequently, the role of the media is crucial to inform citizens about it and to raise public awareness. This paper is devoted to an analysis of the reporting methods of the most visited Montenegrin web portals regarding the topic. We al-so aim to determine how media workers and political agents cover this topic. Since 2007, Montenegro has been constitutionally represented as an ecological state, which has an excellent legislative framework but also numerous environ-mental problems. Bearing these facts in mind, we investigate this topic through the content and discourse analysis of 268 media texts on web portals in the period from October 21 to November 22, 2021 (UN Climate Change Glasgow Conference) and in-depth semistructured interviews with seven important people covering this topic in Montenegro. We conclude that Montenegrin society is environmentally illiterate, although young people are more aware of the threat posed by climate change. The apathy of Montenegrin citizens can partly be attributed to the influence of media that superficially report on this issue and make no effort to educate the population or raise awareness about environmental protection and climate change. © Slovene Anthropological Society 2023"
"The article is dedicated to the problem of extracting keywords from English texts. This task is essential for building ontological models of information retrieval systems, comparing different texts, and other similar tasks. A comparative analysis of well-known methods for extracting both individual words and their combinations has been conducted. Indeed, the most valuable keywords are multi-word ones, as several such words allow for a complete description of both the uniqueness of the text and its correspondence to broader thematic categories. A new notation system and graphical representation of the main stages of each keyword extraction method have been developed. Using this system, notation and graphic visualization of all the most popular methods have been carried out. The advantages and disadvantages of all considered methods have been analyzed. Using the developed notation, several new methods have been proposed, which possess the advantages of known methods but lack their disadvantages. The effectiveness of the known and proposed methods has been tested on a real example of texts from a monograph by one of the authors, which was published with the funding of a grant from the Swedish government’s SIDA on the topic of water resource management in a river basin. The analysis showed that the newly developed methods are more effective, proving the scientific and practical value of the proposed methods notation and constructing new methods based on it. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"On social media, there is a lot of information that can be used for further analysis, such as text data, including posts, comments, and reviews. The data has unstructured properties. The problem in this study is the difficulty of analyzing text on social media data to determine standard and non-standard words, so this research utilizes an approach from word representation with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and transfer learning and using the CNN algorithm. This study produced 3 models in classification performance. In the evaluation model 3 obtained better accuracy compared to model 1 and model 2 because the number of epochs and batch sizes were different. For model 3, the accuracy obtained based on batch values of 64 and epoch values of 20 is 82% for the TF-IDF-CNN model, while the second model uses Word2Vec-CNN with batch values of 128 and epoch values of 60 to obtain 86% accuracy for the Transfer Learning-CNN model with batch values of 256 and epoch values of 100, the accuracy obtained is 91%. © 2023 IEEE."
"In this work, we propose and investigate an original approach to using a pre-trained multimodal transformer of a specialized architecture for controlling a robotic agent in an object manipulation task based on language instruction, which we refer to as RozumFormer. Our model is based on a bimodal (text-image) transformer architecture originally trained for solving tasks that use one or both modalities, such as language modeling, visual question answering, image captioning, text recognition, text-to-image generation, etc. The discussed model has been adapted for robotic manipulation tasks by organizing the input sequence of tokens in a particular way, consisting of tokens for text, images, and actions. We have demonstrated that such a model adapts well to new tasks and shows better results with fine-tuning than complete training in simulation and real environments. To transfer the model from the simulator to a real robot, new datasets were collected and annotated. In addition, experiments controlling the agent in a visual environment using reinforcement learning have shown that fine-tuning the model with a mixed dataset that includes examples from the initial visual-linguistic tasks only slightly decreases performance on these tasks, simplifying the addition of tasks from another domain.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The backbone of the Indian economy is agriculture, yet traditional farmers frequently find it challenging to choose the best products for their rice crops, which results in crop losses. Product recommendation systems, which make personalized recommendations based on consumer behavior and interests, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, putting one of these systems into place may be expensive and demanding regarding technology, data gathering, and analysis. Based on information gathered from agricultural websites, we created a product recommendation system for rice crop disease products to solve these problems. Sentiment analysis is performed on data, calculates the rating, and reviews text sentiment polarities. After that, K means clustering applied on products and disease-wise product data frames and, using the clusters, divides the regions of product clusters into four quadrants and prepares the labeled dataset for a recommendation. An SVM Kernel classifier evaluates and analyzes a labeled dataset. The system has a moderate level of accuracy, which suggests that the labeled datasets are accurate and will be helpful for the recommendation system. Based on the user’s query, our recommendation system recommends the top 5 products using existing labeled datasets of products and disease-specific products. The findings show that farmers can use this technology to choose the optimum outcome for their rice crop disease and increase agricultural output. The system's moderate accuracy on the datasets indicates decent clustering, which makes the recommendation system accurate and successful in resolving problems faced by farmers in the agricultural industry. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market has led to an increasing interest in the subject. Cryptocurrency is now recognized as an asset, and laws and financial regulations have begun to emerge for supporting its practical use. As a result, it has become essential to perform data mining and attain knowledge from text data related to cryptocurrency. Previous studies have focused on analyzing data from a single source such as Twitter. However, there are unique insights to be gained from data across multiple platforms. In the present study, we utilized data mining techniques to extract insights from LexisNexis, Web of Science, and Reddit, representing the media, academia, and general public, respectively. Among unsupervised learning technologies, topic modeling was employed for the analysis. Topic modeling is a methodology that uncovers hidden meanings within the collected data. Among the diverse topic modeling techniques available, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers topic was chosen for the analysis. BERTopic considered to be state-of-the-art in the field of topic modeling. Dynamic topic modeling was employed to track changes in themes over time. Our experimental results reveal a tendency in the news to cover major events related to cryptocurrencies, such as regulatory developments and market trends. Academic papers, on the other hand, tend to focus on the technology behind cryptocurrencies and related research. Finally, social media conversations center more around information delivery from an investor's psychological perspective, such as market sentiment and investment strategies.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The canonical approach to video action recognition dictates a neural network model to do a classic and standard 1-of-N majority vote task. They are trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this article, we provide a new perspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic information of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers. Specifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a multimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with more semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action recognition without any further labeled data or parameters&#x2019; requirements. Moreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous web data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework for action recognition, which we dub <italic>&#x201C;pre-train, adapt and fine-tune.&#x201D;</italic> This paradigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large amount of web image-text or video-text data. Then, it makes the action recognition task to act more like pre-training problems via adaptation engineering. Finally, it is fine-tuned end-to-end on target datasets to obtain strong performance. We give an instantiation of the new paradigm, <italic>ActionCLIP</italic>, which not only has superior and flexible zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability but also reaches a top performance on general action recognition task, achieving 83.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with a ViT-B/16 as the backbone.

"Data-driven machine learning-based methods have provided immense capabilities, revolutionizing sectors like the Buildings-to-grid (B2G) integrated system. Since the penetration rate of distributed energy resources increases towards a net-zero emissions power system, so does the need for advanced services that ensure B2G-integrated system reliability. The convergence of advancements in machine learning, computational resources at the entire cloud-edge continuum, and large datasets from sensing devices enable the development of these data-driven energy analytics services. This work conducts a systematic text-mining-based literature review to examine the diverse range and trends of machine learning methods used to enhance reliability in B2G-integrated systems. While traditional manual sampling and analysis approaches have limited the effectiveness of previous literature review papers in this field, this systematic literature review work aims to synthesize and summarize the existing body of research more efficiently and effectively. To achieve this, this study collected almost 10,500 papers from Scholar and Scopus databases. It employed text-mining-assisted BERTopic-based topic modelling and statistical trend analysis techniques to uncover semantic patterns and explore the temporal evolution of research themes. A two-dimensional taxonomy was derived to analyze the technical papers from a business and machine learning-related perspective. By quantifying the temporal trends within these topics, the study unveiled insights about the state-of-the-art analytics that ensure reliability in the B2G-integrated system domain while proposing future research directions.

"Anaemia is a global burden that affects millions of people’s health and quality of life. It is one of the most severe and important nutritional deficiencies prevailing in the world. Siddha, a known system of Indian Medicine owns numerous medicinal preparations for the treatment of anaemia with literature evidences in many classical texts. To date, many clinical and pre-clinical trials have been carried out in Siddha formulations which were indicated for anaemia. This manuscript deals with the systematic review and meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies of various Siddha formulations used for the treatment of anaemia. The aim of the study was to compile and summarize the findings of all relevant pre-clinical studies of Siddha formulations used for treating anaemia. Data of pre-clinical trials of various haematinic Siddha formulations were retrieved from electronic databases like PubMed, Cochrane, Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, and Google scholar. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were adopted for systematic review and RevMan 5.2 software was used for the meta-analysis. Systematic review demonstrated the difference in haemoglobin (Hb), red blood corpuscles (RBC) count and heavy metals levels in these Siddha herbal and herbo-mineral/herbo-metallic formulations. Meta-analysis has revealed significant increase in Hb and also in total RBC count after treatment with these Siddha Haematinics. The meta-analysis of toxicity studies also reveals that no toxic effects were observed up to the level of therapeutic dose. The outcome of this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that great number of Siddha formulations has been available since ages for the treatment of anaemia and the same has been proved by various evidence based safety and efficacy studies. However, a well-designed randomized clinical trials of these Siddha interventions are need of the hour for the recognition of this traditional system of medicine in the treatment of anaemia globally. © 2023 Arumugam Rajendra Kumar et al.

"Introduction: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a relatively common disease with diverse prognoses. The success of treatment is conditioned by rapid diagnosis and accurate risk stratification. Risk stratification is crucial not only from the perspective of therapeutic strategies but also from the perspective of patient management, which is reflected primarily in the economic costs of treatment. In this work, we have focused on identifying laboratory markers of unfavourable prognosis in patients with PE. Methodology: We prospectively followed patients with PE for 30 days. We analyzed selected laboratory markers as D-dimer, high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and arterial lactate (LAK) for their prognostic potential. The markers were collected at the time of PE diagnosis and processed using standard procedures in the local laboratory. We subsequently investigated their significance in determining short-term (30-day) mortality. Results: 105 patients with PE were included in the prospective study, with a median age of 69 years, with women accounting for 60% of the patients. According to the sPESI clinical score, 51.4% of the patients had low mortality risk and 64.8% of the patients had right ventricular dys-function. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 11 (10.5%) patients died. Patients who died within 30 days had significantly higher levels of D-dimer (20.110 vs 6.785 mg/LFEU, p = 0.035), NT-proBNP (3146 vs 700.0 pg/ml, p = 0.022), CRP (82.44 vs 32.42 mg/ml, p = 0.031) and LAK (3.410 vs 1.795 mmol/l, p = 0.002). Hs-TnI did not show a difference in terms of short-term mortality (124.81 vs 57.340 ng/l, p = 0.234). Subsequently, based on the set of independent predictors, an application formula was developed to derive the mean probability of short-term mortality in patients with PE. We identified a threshold value (pmortality ≥ 0.1), which indicates a significant risk of mortality. In our own cohort the short-term mortality of patients (pmortality ≥ 0.1) was 35.7%. Patients with low mortality risk (pmortality < 0.1) had a short-term mortality rate of 1.2%. Conclusion: Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate of PE remains high. In our study, we confirmed the significance of laboratory parameters in predicting short-term prognosis in patients with PE. The clinical significance lies in the evaluation of multiple laboratory parameters simultaneously, which can refine risk stratification and improve the management of patients with PE.

"Psychotherapy process research has increased in recent years. However, microprocess investigations remain scarce, although they constitute a great contribution to the study of the immediate experience of dialogue between patient and therapist. Microprocess research is the methodological approach par excellence to explore the phenomena of emergence of meanings in psychotherapy at the micro level, that is, an analysis that captures small time sequences to explore the genesis of psychological phenomena in the psychotherapeutic process. The objective of this research was to understand the process of co-construction of meanings within a psychotherapeutic process, from a dialogical and microprocess perspective. A qualitative design of a single, exploratory, and cross-sectional case was used, in which a therapist and his consultant participated. Excerpts from theoretically guided psychotherapeutic dialogue were selected in two randomly selected sessions. The dialogue extracts were transcribed into text and analyzed through a Microgenetic Semiotic Analysis (ASM). The results describe the semiotic-dialogical mechanisms used by the therapist and the client for the emergence of a new meaning about the client’s psychological experience. Semiotic mediation through the dynamics of tension and ambivalence facilitates the emergence of meanings and sometimes rigidifies their elaboration. It is concluded that the emergence of new meanings about oneself occurs with a low semiotic tension, adequate regulatory mechanisms, growth of the field of meaning, constructive elaboration, and semiotic mechanisms that place the meanings in the client (self-referential) with affective content. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Sentiment analysis is a technique for determining whether data is positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The particular challenge in classifying huge amounts of data is that it takes a long time and requires the employment of specialist human resources. Various deep learning techniques have been employed by different researchers to train and classify different datasets with varying outcomes. However, the results are not satisfactory. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Sentiment Analysis approach based on Hybrid Neural Network Techniques. The preprocessing step is first applied to the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset in our architecture, which includes a number of data cleaning and text normalization techniques. The word embedding technique is then used to capture the semantics of the input by clustering semantically related inputs in the embedding space on the cleaned dataset. Finally, generated features were classified using three different deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Hybrid CNN-RNN models, in two different ways, with each technique as follows: classification on the original feature set and classification on the reduced feature set based on Binary Coordinate Ascent (BCA) and Optimal Coordinate Ascent (OCA). The experimental results show that a hybrid CNN-RNN with the BCA and OCA algorithms outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 97.91% accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Using critical theories of dominant- and counter-narratives, this study analyzed the texts of selected young adult books that focused on an underrepresented population of working-class rural youth in Appalachia. We explored how the dominant deficit narratives of these communities shaped the identity construction and choices of the books’ characters, especially their decisions to stay in, leave, or return to their rural hometowns. We showed how those narratives reflected the lives and decisions of real rural young people. We also looked at the identities and ways of being that are available to rural young adult readers and how those identities are connected to structural power and inequity. With over nine million rural students in the United States, each of them deserves to see themselves reflected in the literature they read. © The Author(s) 2023."
"In this study, the steady 2D flow of micropolar fluid via a vertical surface is taken into account. The magnetohydrodynamics applied normally to the flow direction at a vertical surface in the presence of temperature-dependent attributes. The effect of the chemical reaction under the generalized Fourier-Fick law is considered to investigate the heat transference rate at the vertical sheet. Under the flow assumptions, the boundary layer approximations were applied to the nonlinear differential equations and partial differential equations were obtained. The use of similarity modifications allows for a reduction in the number of partial differential equations. The resulting ordinary differential equations are then resolved numerically using a technique known as the homotopy analysis method. The results reveal that microparticle suspensions have a significant impact on the flowing domain when varied fluid characteristics are utilized. The effect of potential factors on flow, micro-rotation velocities, temperature, drag force factor, and heat transport rate is investigated. The obtained results show that the velocity profile and micropolar function increase for larger values of micropolar parameters. Drag force effects are also seen, and required outcomes are observed to be in outstanding accord with the available literature. Significant results of this work were toward the velocity function, which gets reduced with increasing magnetic field parameter values, but the velocity function enhances for higher values of β \beta and λ \lambda. On temperature distribution, it decreased for higher values of 1 {{\epsilon }}{1} and temperature profile declines due to higher values of Pr \text{Pr}, γ 2 {\gamma }{2} and γ 1 {\gamma }{1} or both cases of δ > 0 \delta \gt 0 and δ < 0 \delta \lt 0. The higher values of Sc \text{Sc} resist declining the temperature function at the surface.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."
"In the context of accelerated urbanization, metropolitan green infrastructure is considered a strategic approach to ensure healthy and sustainable living environments. Earth Observation (EO) offers the right means for large scale and long term assessment and monitoring of such green areas and the entire urban environment. The methodology presented in this paper leverages one of the most common satellite missions for vegetation assessment, the Sentinel-2 mission, applies super-resolutions techniques to increase the image spatial resolution and quantifies the spectral radiation reflected by the ground in order to map the Earth's biophysical properties. By considering multiple acquisitions over the same area, time series of spectral indices are generated and processed using LDA, a generative model well known for hierarchical latent information extraction in both text and image analysis. The resulting temporal signature of each topic is further correlated with the evidence of environmental indicators to underline the vegetation vulnerability and specificity of the species. A use case centered for the Bucharest city in Romania, was included. © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: Depression and anxiety are significant contributors to maternal perinatal morbidity and a range of negative child outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to review and assess the diagnostic test accuracy of selected screening tools (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS], EPDS-3A, Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]-, PHQ-2, Matthey Generic Mood Question [MGMQ], Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7], GAD-2, and the Whooley questions) used to identify women with antenatal depression or anxiety in Western countries. Material and methods: On January 16, 2023, we searched 10 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, CRD Database, Embase, Epistemonikos, International HTA Database, KSR Evidence, Ovid MEDLINE, PROSPERO and PsycINFO); the references of included studies were also screened. We included studies of any design that compared case-identification with a relevant screening tool to the outcome of a diagnostic interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth or fifth edition (DSM-IV or DSM-5), or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Diagnoses of interest were major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-texts for relevance and evaluated the risk of bias using QUADAS-2. Data extraction was performed by one person and checked by another team member for accuracy. For synthesis, a bivariate model was used. The certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Registration: PROSPERO CRD42021236333. Results: We screened 8276 records for eligibility and included 16 original articles reporting on diagnostic test accuracy: 12 for the EPDS, one article each for the GAD-2, MGMQ, PHQ-9, PHQ-2, and Whooley questions, and no articles for the EPDS-3A or GAD-7. Most of the studies had moderate to high risk of bias. Ten of the EPDS articles provided data for synthesis at cutoffs ≥10 to ≥14 for diagnosing major depressive disorder. Cutoff ≥10 gave the optimal combined sensitivity (0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75–0.90) and specificity (0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.92). Conclusions: Findings from the meta-analysis suggest that the EPDS alone is not perfectly suitable for detection of major depressive disorder during pregnancy. Few studies have evaluated the other instruments, therefore, their usefulness for identification of women with depression and anxiety during pregnancy remains very uncertain. At present, case-identification with any tool may best serve as a complement to a broader dialogue between healthcare professionals and their patients. © 2023 The Authors.

"This paper explores how Japan employed language education to justify Japanese imperial surveillance practices by examining the depiction of policemen and military police officers in Japanese language textbooks used by Korean primary students during the colonial period under Japanese rule. The analysis of the Japanese language textbooks used during this period uncovered the colonial educational goals and ideologies presented to Korean students, the ideal colonial citizens desired by the ruling system, and colonial aims furthered. This study investigates the ideologies presented in the textbooks using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Visual Image Analysis (VIA) by analyzing eight textbooks that were used in Japan and Korea. Both images and texts relating to Japanese government officials in the textbooks for Koreans from the colonial era are analyzed. The study reveals that the textbooks positioned Korean students to accept and integrate Japanese ideologies and attempted to indoctrinate Koreans into believing that the Japanese government officials were kind and cooperative, while also maximizing their authority over the colonized in their portrayal. The portrayal of government officials in the textbooks further reinforced this by showing the colonized having to display good behavior to authority figures, while not conveying any negative images of the government officials. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising avenue for machine learning with superior energy efficiency compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Recent advances in training and input encoding have put SNNs on par with state-of-the-art ANNs in image classification. However, such tasks do not utilize the internal dynamics of SNNs fully. Notably, a spiking neuron&#x2019;s membrane potential acts as an internal memory, merging incoming inputs sequentially. This recurrent dynamic enables the networks to learn temporal correlations, making SNNs suitable for sequential learning. Such problems can also be tackled using ANNs. However, to capture the temporal dependencies, either the inputs have to be lumped over time (e.g. Transformers); or explicit recurrence needs to be introduced (e.g. recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks), which incurs considerable complexity. To that end, we explore the capabilities of SNNs in providing lightweight solutions to four sequential tasks involving text, speech and vision. Our results demonstrate that SNNs, by leveraging their intrinsic memory, can be an efficient alternative to RNNs and LSTMs for sequence processing, especially for certain edge applications. Furthermore, SNNs can be combined with ANNs (hybrid networks) synergistically to obtain the best of both worlds in terms of accuracy and efficiency. IEEE"
"This exploratory study aims to offer new insights into the lexical ambiguity in the interlanguage arising from the use of false cognates. The study is based on written texts from two learners' corpora. Utterances including false cognates were retrieved from both corpora and presented to two groups of native speakers who assessed their correctness and stated whether or not they were ambiguous. While the first group was informed beforehand that the sentences had been produced by non-native speakers (as well as the meaning of the false cognates in their L1), the second group had no information regarding the speakers who wrote them. The goal of this analysis is to shed light on the different perceptions that can arise from native vs. non-native speakers' productions, focusing on lexical ambiguity. © 2023 The Authors.

"In application development, achieving synergy between evolving software and elicitation process outcomes emerges as a foundational objective. This endeavor is empowered by the role of text analysis, a tool that adeptly uncovers intricate data relationships and contextual intricacies. This is especially pertinent given the textual attributes of System Requirements Specification (SRS) information. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) adds depth to comprehension by converting images into text. However, challenges surface due to variances between functional requirements and the design's control and affordance components, arising from divergent interpretations of functional requirements during elicitation. Our focal point resides in crafting an application to evaluate the alignment between UI design and the textual core of functional requirements. This study reveals 13 Functional Requirements (d1-d13) and categorizes two control/affordance component documents (d14-d15). The integration of text analysis, steered by word2vec, drives an alignment process, culminating in a notable 0.397 score. Recommendations pivot on the Cohen's Kappa index; values below 0.21 prompt adjustments for alignment at a 'sufficient' level (0.21 or higher). The culmination of research materializes in an advanced application adept at processing txt files, skillfully extracting inputs via text analysis, and semantically evaluating alignment through Word2Vec. It offers insights for data instances where standards fall short, firmly rooted in Cohen's Kappa index principles. This application functions as a comprehensive repository, methodically outlining enhancement suggestions, assessed against the backdrop of Cohen's Kappa index. © 2023 IEEE."
"KAMENSKIKH, Aleksey. ""Antiquising Imagination"" in the Service of Political Expansion: On the Eve of the ""Great Greek Project"" of Catherine II. The paper explores the materials of the correspondence of Voltaire and Catherine II for examination the schemes of Enlightenment historical imagination and arguments to history used for conceptualizing and legitimation of current political events and actions during the Russian-Ottoman war of 1768 - 1774. Tropological analysis reveals, among the series of sustained historical arguments having been developed by the ""patriarch of the Enlightenment"" in his aspirations to persuade the Russian empress to become the ""queen of the Greeks"" and European countries to support Catherine in her struggle against the Ottoman Empire, an especial type of classicist imaginative schemes (schemes of ""antiquising imagination"") which were emerging in the correspondence during the discussion of the Balkan issues. The paper demonstrates how in these schemes, the territories of the Northern Pontic, the Balkans and the Archipelago were imagined and described by the participants of the correspondence in terms of the language which goes back to the texts by Greek classical authors included in the circle of classicist modern European education; analyses the political functions of this language in the texts of the French philosopher and the Russian empress; describes the first outlines of the future ""Byzantine idea"" in Russian political imagination. © 2023 Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra.

"In MOOCs, identifying urgent comments on discussion forums is an ongoing challenge. Whilst urgent comments require immediate reactions from instructors, to improve interaction with their learners, and potentially reducing drop-out rates—the task is difficult, as truly urgent comments are rare. From a data analytics perspective, this represents a highly unbalanced (sparse) dataset. Here, we aim to automate the urgent comments identification process, based on fine-grained learner modelling—to be used for automatic recommendations to instructors. To showcase and compare these models, we apply them to the first gold standard dataset for U rgent i N structor I n TE rvention (UNITE), which we created by labelling FutureLearn MOOC data. We implement both benchmark shallow classifiers and deep learning. Importantly, we not only compare, for the first time for the unbalanced problem, several data balancing techniques, comprising text augmentation, text augmentation with undersampling, and undersampling, but also propose several new pipelines for combining different augmenters for text augmentation. Results show that models with undersampling can predict most urgent cases; and 3X augmentation + undersampling usually attains the best performance. We additionally validate the best models via a generic benchmark dataset (Stanford). As a case study, we showcase how the naïve Bayes with count vector can adaptively support instructors in answering learner questions/comments, potentially saving time or increasing efficiency in supporting learners. Finally, we show that the errors from the classifier mirrors the disagreements between annotators. Thus, our proposed algorithms perform at least as well as a ‘super-diligent’ human instructor (with the time to consider all comments). © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The role of social media in crisis response and recovery is becoming increasingly prominent due to the rapid progression of information and communication technologies. This study introduces a transformative approach to extract valuable information from the enormous volume of user-generated content on social media, specifically focusing on tweets that can significantly aid emergency response and recovery efforts. The identification of informative tweets allows emergency personnel to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crisis situations, thereby facilitating the deployment of more effective recovery strategies. Previous studies have largely focused on either the textual content or the accompanying visual elements within tweets. However, evidence suggests a complementary relationship between text and visuals, offering an opportunity for synergistic insights. In response to this, a novel deep learning framework is proposed, which concurrently analyses both textual and visual components extracted from user-generated tweets. The central architecture integrates established methodologies, including RoBERTa for text analysis, Vision Transformer for image understanding, Bi-LSTM for sequence processing, and an attention mechanism for context awareness. The innovation of this approach lies in its emphasis on multimodal fusion, introducing rank fusion techniques to effectively combine the strengths of textual and visual inputs. The proposed methodology is extensively tested across seven diverse datasets, representing various natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. The experimental results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed system, compared to several existing methods, with accuracy levels ranging from 94% to 98%. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed deep learning classifier in leveraging interactions across multiple modalities. In summary, this study contributes to disaster management by promoting a comprehensive approach that exploits the potential of multimodal data, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in emergency scenarios. © 2023 Lavoisier.

"Detecting machine-generated text (MGT), also known as Deepfake text, has become increasingly important in Artificial Intelligence (AI) age and social media platforms. With the proliferation of MGT and the potential consequences of its dissemination, there is a pressing need to develop effective methods for distinguishing between MGT and human-written text (HWT). Our research aim has two-fold: firstly, to examine the inherent differences between MGT and HWT on Twitter, and secondly, to develop a classifier specifically designed for MGT detection on the platform. This classifier utilizes contextualized text embeddings as its foundation while considering additional linguistic features, sentiment features, and emoji embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating additional features enhances the model's ability to detect MGT. Combining fine-tuned BERT embeddings with emoji and linguistic features using a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves the highest accuracy rate of 88.3%. Our analysis reveals distinct characteristics of MGT compared to HWT, including differences in engagement behavior, linguistic patterns, named entities, sentiment expressions, and text perplexity. Our research contributes to the field of MGT detection by offering a comprehensive approach that combines semantic text embeddings with supplementary features. The proposed model provides a significant step forward in addressing the challenge of Deepfake text detection.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Race-based health information is necessary to address disproportionate barriers racial communities face and to achieve optimal health outcomes. In Canada, Black people are disproportionately affected by HIV. There is an emerging body of literature on this topic, but a concise summary is lacking. There is a need to collectively and critically analyze research on HIV in the Black population in Canada to identify knowledge gaps and address this disproportionate burden. Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to summarize the evidence on HIV and Black people in Canada. The main outcomes of interest are HIV prevalence, access to care, HIV prevention and treatment, the HIV care cascade, and related HIV outcomes. Through this scoping review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and highlight topics that need more investigation in future research. Methods: We will conduct a scoping review of electronic databases using a systematic search strategy for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods studies reporting on HIV and Black people in Canada. We will conduct our searches in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Google Scholar for literature published between 1985 and 2023. Gray literature, including government reports, dissertations, and other reports, will be included. Search results will be screened, and the full text of relevant literature will be retrieved. The extraction of data will be conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Consensus meetings will be held to resolve conflicts. Our results will be reported according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews).

Information from these articles will be compared using charts and tables. Screening will start in November 2023, and we anticipate publishing the scoping review in June 2024. Conclusions: The findings from this scoping review will help inform policy, practice, and research on HIV and Black people in Canada. ©Tatyana Graham, Agatha Nyambi, Aisha Barkhad, Maya Stevens-Uninsky, Nadia Rehman, Neera Bhatnagar, Lawrence Mbuagbaw."
"Introduction: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can lead to chronic diseases and mental health conditions; however, less is known about the associations of ACEs to the reproductive traumas of infertility and pregnancy loss. The purpose of this integrative review was to explore relationships between ACEs and the reproductive traumas of infertility and pregnancy loss. Methods: We searched PubMed, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases in December 2021 and 2022. Inclusion criteria were qualitative or quantitative research, systematic or integrative reviews, or meta-analysis articles in English that were peer-reviewed and full-text, addressing any ACE from the ACE Checklist and infertility or pregnancy loss. A total of 20 articles were included in the review. We used Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review framework, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for reporting, and Covidence software for data management. A quality appraisal using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools was performed. Relevant data were extracted into a matrix for iterative comparison. Results: Twenty studies were included in the review. Results support there may be an association between pregnancy loss and infertility in women with a history of ACE, although results are mixed between infertility and ACEs. We also identified other concepts related to ACEs and the reproductive traumas of infertility and pregnancy loss and include racial and ethnically diverse populations, social determinants of health, modifiable risk factors, and stress appraisals. Discussion: Midwives and other women's health care providers should be aware that ACEs may be associated with pregnancy loss and infertility, although additional research is needed to further explore the relationships with infertility, mental health, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation from allostatic load. Trauma-informed care and the development of effective interventions are warranted for women who experience ACEs. Providers should consider earlier interventions, including emotional services, for women with a history of ACE or reproductive trauma. © 2023 The Authors.

"The purpose of this article is to analyse the descriptions of the locust (Joel 1) and the approaching army (Joel 2) in an attempt to reconstruct the scenario of events that could explain the maximum details of the text. Usually, scholars identify the locust and the army based on an assumed date of the book’s composition. This article suggests a different approach: first to identify the characters of Joel 1 and 2 based on the thorough analysis of the text and reconstruct the possible scenario of the events, before trying to define with which time frame this scenario better fits. The analysis arrived at the following conclusions: the author deliberately portrays the invasion of the locust (Joel 1) and the approaching army (Joel 2) as two events of a similar significance, scope and consequences. Both, the locust attack and the approaching army should be interpreted as pointing to the military vents. The description of the locust invasion is used as a metaphor for the destruction of the Northern Kingdom by Assyria. The prophet invites the population of Judah to wail over the destruction of the sister-state but no one heeded the prophet’s invitation. Then Joel announces another calamity (Joel 2) that will hit Judah if the people do not repent. © (2023), (Old Testament Society of South Africa). All Rights Reserved."
"Sentiment analysis is frequently worn for opinion mining of giving data or corpora a name or label (high quality, bad, impartial) into information or corpus. It is possible to say that NLP (Natural Language Processing) is used for preprocess data and clean text so it can be comprehended by machines. Text classification is worn to handle data and corpora that are entered into the multi-layer perceptron model of the classification engine, which will then result in a projection of exactness percentage > 90%. (better). A supervised learning process is the figure of the data used to convey the output of the machine learning model. The accuracy of the machine model that was drill is improved by the use of model selection, which employs the Monte Carlo cross-validation model.

"With the development of generative models like GPT-3, it is increasingly more challenging to differentiate generated texts from human-written ones. There is a large number of studies that have demonstrated good results in bot identification. However, the majority of such works depend on supervised learning methods that require labelled data and/or prior knowledge about the bot-model architecture. In this work, we propose a bot identification algorithm that is based on unsupervised learning techniques and does not depend on a large amount of labelled data. By combining findings in semantic analysis by clustering (crisp and fuzzy) and information techniques, we construct a robust model that detects a generated text for different types of bot. We find that the generated texts tend to be more chaotic while literary works are more complex. We also demonstrate that the clustering of human texts results in fuzzier clusters in comparison to the more compact and well-separated clusters of bot-generated texts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Numerous studies have proven that abnormal behaviors related to business and transactions can be detected from user logs. In actual use, we discover that user logs are often formatted in complex ways, and there are challenges to analyzing them: (1) errors in log parsing that necessitate significant human intervention to resolve accurately, and (2) insufficient information mining. These two issues often result in increased human investment and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose DeepUserLog, a framework for anomaly detection of user logs containing a large number of key-value pairs. Our approach sidesteps the necessity of cumbersome preprocessing and a log parsing step that risks introducing noise. DeepUserLog retrieves the key-value pairs within the log and extracts the semantic features of the content after removing the values in key-value pairs, representing them as semantic vectors. In addition, the framework categorizes key-value pairs into four types while leveraging and identifying the temporal keys to uncover deeper connections between logs. Furthermore, it conducts a more thorough analysis of the information associated with numeric and text-based key-value pairs. DeepUserLog has been validated on real-world user log datasets from industry and public system log datasets, yielding promising results confirming its efficacy.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Log parsing has become an essential tool for extracting valuable information from a vast volume of log lines. It involves identifying standard patterns and extracting templates from these lines, enabling researchers and companies to employ advanced mining techniques like log deduplication and log anomaly detection. However, existing log parsing approaches have limitations. They often operate on small batches of log text and lack consideration for the entire context, necessitating prior knowledge of the log dataset. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of practical experience reports on the utilization of these log parsing approaches in the literature. In our paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel log parsing approach that combines Transformers with a customized textual analysis. This textual analysis balances the density clustering of similar log lines, the calculation of word frequencies inside each cluster and the presence of the words inside an English vocabulary to parse new log lines. Our method outperforms existing parsing methods in terms of accuracy and operates as an unsupervised learning approach, eliminating the need for prior knowledge. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept application of our parsing method in an industrial setting, showcasing its practical implementation.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Many studies have utilized speech data to automatically detect Alzheimer&#x0027;s Disease (AD). However, most of them simply take the speech data from a subject participating in a task (e.g., picture description) as a whole audio sequence, and lack considerations on separate utterances that may be related to different topics in the picture and are of different importance for discriminating AD patients from healthy controls. To this end, this paper proposes an AD detection method with topic modeling for utterances composed of audio words. First, an audio word discovery algorithm using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is designed to tokenize speech data without relying on text transcriptions. Then, a topic model is built that assigns each utterance a topic label in an unsupervised way. Finally, an Audio-Word HuBERT (AW-HuBERT) model integrating utterance-level topic labels is constructed for AD detection. This model is pretrained by training the existing HuBERT model with audio word sequences. The final decision for a recording is made by the weighted sum of utterance-level classification possibilities, and topic-dependent Area-Under-Curve (AUC) values are used as the weights. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that the proposed method achieves a better AD detection accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. IEEE"
"Objectives: To systematically develop an adaptation model to reduce climate change-related health risks for outdoor athletes. Design: Delphi Method study. Methods: A classic asynchronous Delphi study was conducted with a total of three survey rounds. 24 experts from the eight largest outdoor sport associations by membership in the German Olympic Sports Confederation were included as well as 24 medical experts with expertise in sport medicine, internal medicine, allergology, dermatology, infectiology, or toxicology. Based on open-ended questions, panelists were asked to consider prevention measures for sport organizations and clubs. Free text responses were analyzed by qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Results: Experts recommended establishing the following eight fields of prevention measures: technical and structural measures; organizational measures; personalized measures; basic, advanced, and continuing education; concepts of action, warning concepts, and financial concepts; cooperation and coordination; campaigns; and evaluation measures. Conclusions: The pyramid model presented in this study systematizes possible sport-specific adaptation measures on climate change by empirical aggregation of knowledge from scientists, sport organizations, clubs, trainers, and professional athletes. To assess the effectiveness of these prevention measures, sport organizations may incorporate them not only into broader operations but also everyday training routines. © 2023"
"Background: Good usability is important for the adoption and continued use of mobile health (mHealth) apps. In particular, high usability can support intuitive use by patients, which improves compliance and increases the app’s effectiveness. However, many usability studies do not use adequate tools to measure perceived usability. The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was developed specifically for end users in a medical context. MAUQ is a relatively new but increasingly used questionnaire to evaluate mHealth apps, but it is not yet available in German. Objective: This study aims to translate MAUQ into German and determine its internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity. Methods: This validation study was conducted as part of a usability evaluation project for an mHealth app used as a therapy support tool during breast cancer chemotherapy. MAUQ was translated into German through a rigorous forward-backward translation process, ensuring semantic and conceptual equivalence. Patient responses to MAUQ and System Usability Scale (SUS) were analyzed for validation. Descriptive analysis was performed for the MAUQ subscales and SUS standard scores. Significance tests and correlation coefficients assessed the relationship between the SUS and MAUQ results, confirming construct validity. Internal consistency was assessed for item reliability and consistency in measuring the target construct. Free-text questions assessed translation comprehensibility, with responses analyzed descriptively and qualitatively using content analysis. Results: In this study, 133 participants responded to the questionnaire, and the validation analysis showed substantially positive correlations between the overall MAUQ score and its subscales: ease of use (r=0.56), interface and satisfaction (r=0.75), and usefulness (r=0.83). These findings support the construct validity of MAUQ and emphasize the importance of these subscales in assessing the usability of the Enable app. The correlation coefficients ranging from 0.39 to 0.68 for the items further validate the questionnaire by aligning with the overall score and capturing the intended concept. The high internal consistency reliability of MAUQ (Cronbach α=.81) and its subscales further enhances the instrument’s robustness in accurately evaluating the usability of mHealth apps. Conclusions: We successfully validated the German translation of the MAUQ for stand-alone apps using a standardized approach in a cohort of patients with breast cancer. In our validation study, MAUQ exhibited strong internal consistency reliability (Cronbach α=.81) across its subscales, indicating reliable and consistent measurement. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (P<.001) was found between the subscales and the overall score, supporting their consistent measurement of the intended construct. Therefore, MAUQ can be considered a reliable instrument for assessing the usability of mHealth apps among German-speaking adults. The availability of the German version of MAUQ will help other researchers in conducting usability studies of mHealth apps in German-speaking cohorts and allow for international comparability of their results. © Preetha Moorthy, Lina Weinert, Bendix Christian Harms, Carolin Anders, Fabian Siegel."

"In the present study, text presentation in biology textbooks was analyzed with respect to misconception and elements of conceptual change towards the learning of “Cell Structure”. Content analysis of the lesson “Cell Structure” in five biology textbooks of Grades 11 and 12 across selected educational boards in Asia like the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP), Cambridge Advanced Subsidiary and Advanced Level (AS-A Level), Advanced Placements Board (AP Board), Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Tamil Nadu Board of Higher Secondary Education (TNBHSE) was carried out to identify the differences in text-presentation with respect to misconceptions and elements of conceptual change towards the learning of “Cell Structure”. Analysis for elements of conceptual change was carried out by applying “Posner’s Model of Conceptual Change” needed for the replacement of these misconceptions. The results of the analysis indicate that all four elements needed for conceptual change learning were found only in biology textbooks of international boards. The study further reports that the text presentation in these biology textbooks is non-expository with refutational characteristics fostering conceptual understanding by “reasoning and inquiry”. In contrast, text presentation in biology textbooks of Indian educational boards is expository, fostering conceptual understanding by “memorization”. © 2023 The Author(s).

"On March 18, 2011, one of Germany’s most famous children’s book authors, Gudrun Pausewang (1928-2020), publicly spoke about the connection between 3/11 and her award-winning 1987 classic, Fall-Out (Die Wolke). I posit that Michaël Ferrier’s texts with a 3/11 theme highlight the synchronic as well as diachronic dimensions of the Great East Japan Disaster and therefore go far beyond Pausewang’s 1987 approach to think globally about nuclear energy and technological risk scenarios. While Pausewang’s novel focuses on the tragic experience of a young adult who copes with the aftermath of a nuclear accident in Germany in the 1980s, Ferrier strategically reveals the complexities of knowledge and uncertainty in the wake of environmental and human catastrophe as an on-going crisis or déjà-vu of Chernobyl and Hiroshima. My analysis explores Ferrier’s (re)mediation of the convolution of this crisis across various media, including documents of popular culture, by insisting on the thematic and structural connections between his texts with a 3/11 theme, Pausewang’s 1987 novel, and two German adaptations of Pausewang’s novel, Gregor Schnitzler’s 2006 drama film, Die Wolke, as well as a Anike Hage’s 2008 graphic novel. Ferrier’s works unapologetically reveal elisions that have occurred in mediated disaster narratives across borders. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This paper comprehensively reviews medical VQA models, structures, and datasets, focusing on combining vision and language. Over 75 models and their statistical and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses were compared and analyzed. The study highlights whether the researchers in the general field influence those in the medical field. According to an analysis of text encoding techniques, LSTM is the approach that is utilized the most (42%), followed by non-text methods (14%) and BiLSTM (12%), whereas VGGNet (40%) and ResNet (22%) are the most often used vision methods, followed by Ensemble approaches (16%). Regarding fusion techniques, 14% of the models employed non-specific methods, while SAN (13%) and concatenation (10%) were frequently used. The study identifies LSTM-VGGNet and LSTM-ResNet combinations as the primary approaches in medical VQA, with 18% and 15% usage rates, respectively. The statistical analysis of medical VQA from 2018 to 2023 and individual yearly analyses reveals consistent preferences for LSTM and VGGNet, except in 2018 when ResNet was more commonly used. The SWOT analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of medical VQA research, highlighting areas for future exploration. These areas include addressing limited dataset sizes, enhancing question diversity, mitigating unimodal bias, exploring multi-modal datasets, leveraging external knowledge, incorporating multiple images, ensuring practical medical application integrity, improving model interpretation, and refining evaluation methods. This paper&#x2019;s findings contribute to understanding medical VQA and offer valuable guidance for future researchers aiming to make advancements in this field. Authors"
"In this exploratory study, we delved deeply into the intricate interplay of color choices within AI-generated and human-designed posters, analyzing a sample of 120 instances from each category. While it is suggested that human designers may integrate cultural, emotional, and situational contexts into their creations, AI models largely base their selections on vast datasets and pattern recognition. Although AI exhibited prowess in replicating established design parameters, the study underlined the importance of critically assessing its outputs. The quantitative analysis illuminated overarching similarities in primary color selections. However, the AI's diversity in color remains less concentrated than that of human, suggesting a gap in the AI's capacity to match human expertise in color proportioning and distribution. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial to discern its capabilities and potential limitations in the design domain, ensuring it augments human creativity rather than supplanting it. Notably, the research refrains from seeking human validation, aiming instead for an objective, data-driven reflection on the convergences and divergences between AI-generated and human designs. © 2023 The Authors.

"The article is dedicated to reflecting the links between the climate crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic crisis in the context of Czech social media, specifically on several blogging platforms. The processes leading to the climate and pandemic crises are highly intertwined, based in the way humans interact with the environment on a global scale. However, the circumstances and consequences of both crises, as well as the ways they are dealt with, also share common features. The authors identify such contexts as reflected on blogging platforms by undertaking a qualitative analysis of texts from an interpretative phenomenological perspective. Climate scepticism is connected to pandemic scepticism, on the one hand, and to acceptance of the pandemic as a real threat, on the other hand. Conversely, acceptance of the climate crisis can be associated with both acceptance of the pandemic and pandemic scepticism. © Authors, Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 2023."
"Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has been a growing point of interest in medical education yet has not been assessed in the field of bioethics. This study evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5 (April 2023 version) in answering text-based, multiple choice bioethics questions at the level of US third-year and fourth-year medical students. A total of 114 bioethical questions were identified from the widely utilised question banks UWorld and AMBOSS. Accuracy, bioethical categories, difficulty levels, specialty data, error analysis and character count were analysed. We found that ChatGPT had an accuracy of 59.6%, with greater accuracy in topics surrounding death and patient-physician relationships and performed poorly on questions pertaining to informed consent. Of all the specialties, it performed best in paediatrics. Yet, certain specialties and bioethical categories were under-represented. Among the errors made, it tended towards content errors and application errors. There were no significant associations between character count and accuracy. Nevertheless, this investigation contributes to the ongoing dialogue on artificial intelligence's (AI) role in healthcare and medical education, advocating for further research to fully understand AI systems' capabilities and constraints in the nuanced field of medical bioethics.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"INTRODUCTION: The Internet era has made the world more closely connected, and ecotourism has also caught up with the Internet era of cloud computing, making more and more international ecotourism destinations in China known to the world. China's global ecotourism industry has made significant progress, but it needs to be better to construct international ecotourism destinations. Therefore, conducts the grouping analysis of QCA of international ecotourism destinations in the cloud computing era of geo-ecology. OBJECTIVES: To improve the construction level of China's international ecotourism destinations and promote the in-depth development of China's global ecotourism; to solve the dilemma that China's ecotourism destinations are imperfectly constructed, and the brand can not go out; and to promote the enhancement of tourism concepts of international ecotourism destinations in the age of computers. METHODS: Firstly, the feasibility analysis of international ecotourism destination construction in the cloud computing era is carried out by using QCA analysis and histogram analysis; secondly, the relevant QCA model is established to analyze the influencing factors of international ecotourism destination construction; lastly, the tripartite game model is utilized to explore the benefits of international ecotourism destinations for the residents, the government, and the enterprises. RESULTS: The construction of international ecotourism destinations in China is feasible from the perspectives of functional spatial configuration, economic development, cultural tradition, and natural environment; the structure of international ecotourism destinations has an apparent positive driving effect on the construction sites; the tripartite game model shows that there are positive benefits not only for the residents, government, and enterprises but also for the related groups and tourists. CONCLUSION: From the full text of the study, the construction of international ecotourism destinations has a significant driving effect on China's economy; however, the tourism industry in the era of cloud computing needs to be further standardized, and the construction of international ecotourism destinations should be strengthened. © 2023 Gao et al., licensed to EAI.

"Texts in industrial production contain massive amounts of faulty textual information, as traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) have difficulties in extracting sufficient valid information in the multi-classification task of texts. A multi-scale CNN composite model based on a self-attention and an Inception residual connection module is proposed. The method preprocesses unstructured text, obtains a text vector from the input text by word embedding, extracts feature at more scales using the CNN and Inception modules, and assigns weights to the feature vectors through the self-attention so that the model can pay more attention to the key information in the text, thus improving the performance of the model in text classification tasks. Taking the industrial equipment fault data of an automotive company as an example, the proposed method outperforms the traditional model in terms of precision, recall and f1-measure evaluation indexes, and provides a new idea for the research of industrial production equipment fault diagnosis.  © 2023 IEEE."
"To explain how the human brain represents and organizes meaning, many theoretical and computational language models have been proposed over the years, varying in their underlying computational principles and in the language samples based on which they are built. However, how well they capture the neural encoding of lexical semantics remains elusive. We used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to evaluate to what extent three models of different types explained neural responses elicited by word stimuli: an External corpus-based word2vec model, an Internal free word association model, and a Hybrid ConceptNet model. Semantic networks were constructed using word relations computed in the three models and experimental stimuli were selected through a community detection procedure. The similarity patterns between language models and neural responses were compared at the community, exemplar, and word node levels to probe the potential hierarchical semantic structure. We found that semantic relations computed with the Internal model provided the closest approximation to the patterns of neural activation, whereas the External model did not capture neural responses as well. Compared with the exemplar and the node levels, community-level RSA demonstrated the broadest involvement of brain regions, engaging areas critical for semantic processing, including the angular gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and a large portion of the anterior temporal lobe. The findings highlight the multidimensional semantic organization in the brain which is better captured by Internal models sensitive to multiple modalities such as word association compared with External models trained on text corpora. © 2023 The Authors.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the field of natural language processing and revolutionizing the way machines interact with humans. LLMs like ChatGPT and Google's Bard have already made significant strides in conversational AI, enabling machines to understand natural language and respond in a more human-like manner. In addition to typical applications like sentiment analysis and text generation, LLMs are also used in safety-critical applications such as code generation and speech comprehension in autonomous driving vehicles, where reliability is important.In this work, we investigate the resilience of LLMs under transient hardware faults. Specifically, we used IR-level fault injection (FI) to assess the reliability of five popular LLMs, including Bert, GPT2, and T5, under transient hardware faults. Moreover, we also investigate how the resilience of LLMs varies with different pre-training, fine-tuning objectives, and the number of encoder and decoder blocks. We find that LLMs are quite resilient to transient faults overall. We also find that the behavior of the LLM under transient faults varies significantly with the input, LLM's architecture, and the type of task (e.g., translation vs. fill-in-the-blank). Finally, we find that the Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate varies with different fine-tuning objectives, and for the fill-mask fine-tuning objective, the SDC rate also increases with the model size. Overall, our findings indicate that the use of LLMs in safety-critical applications needs further investigation.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Entity extraction is widely used in power fault diagnosis to extract valuable knowledge from a large amount of power fault data, supporting fault diagnosis and prevention. Traditional entity extraction methods mainly rely on fixed rules and procedures, which cannot be dynamically learned or changed with new data or knowledge. When dealing with complex and variable power plant fault data, traditional methods have limitations. This paper proposes a text mining-based entity extraction method that updates the model by learning fault data characteristics. This makes the model more adaptive and flexible to cope with complex and variable data. We compared and analyzed experimental results based on real fault data. The results show that our method effectively extracts fault entities from power plants and has a high accuracy and recall rate. This has a significant reference value for improving the efficiency and accuracy of power plant fault processing.  © 2023 IEEE."
"One often used approach to increase students' reading frequency is investing in independent silent reading (ISR) at schools: regularly scheduling time during which students read silently in books of their own choice. However, evidence for the impact of ISR is inconclusive and there appear to be important barriers to its effects on students' reading frequency, motivation, and proficiency: particularly struggling readers have difficulties choosing appropriate books, simply allotting time for reading does not guarantee that students read, ISR lacks accountability, and students are not always given the opportunity to interact about what they read. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to test whether additions to ISR that aim to overcome these barriers contribute to the effects of ISR on students' reading. Using outcomes of 51 effect studies covering 56 samples of students in primary and secondary education, we established a small but significant positive short-term intervention effect on overall reading proficiency (Cohen's d = 0.27). We additionally found that additions to ISR were particularly effective for students at risk of reading failure; for stronger readers, effects were absent. Finally, we found a negative effect of help or instruction by the teacher, which suggests that activities during reading might interfere with students' engagement with texts. © 2023 The Authors"
"Purpose: Utilizing the expectation states theory in sociology, this study probes into the influence of the board's informal hierarchy on the quality of enterprise innovation, originating from the perspective of internal directorial interactions, while analyzing the boundary effects exhibited by the nature of property rights and the intensity of geo-culture. Design/methodology/approach: The study selects China's A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2021 as the research sample, employing the Tobit regression analysis method to scrutinize the hypotheses presented in the text. Findings: The regression results demonstrate a positive correlation between the board's informal hierarchy and the enterprise innovation quality (EIQ). Upon introducing variables specific to property rights and geographical culture, the authors found that in comparison to non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), the influence of the board's informal hierarchy on the quality of corporate innovation is diminished in SOEs. Conversely, the intensity of geo-culture across Chinese provinces enhances their mutual positive influence. In the additional analysis, the authors also found that the elevation of corporate risk tolerance is a significant pathway for the positive effect of the board's informal hierarchy on EIQ. Moreover, this positive influence is more profound in high-tech enterprises, businesses implementing equity incentive plans and companies that have subscribed to director and officer liability insurance. Originality/value: The findings not only deepen the understanding of how the board's internal status characteristics influence corporate decision-making but also enrich the application scope of expectation states theory. Furthermore, this study offers valuable guidance for optimizing innovation decision-making by adjusting the personnel structures of corporate boards. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Digital transformation provides new opportunities for companies, but also unexpected consequences. We quantify the firms’ level of digitalization using text analysis to examine whether digital transformation affects financial investment. The results conclude that digital transformation increases financial investment and our findings remain valid after robustness checks, indicating that digital transformation unexpectedly exacerbates the financialization problem of Chinese companies. We further discuss the motive and channels of corporate financialization under digital transformation. Our results show that digital transformation increases financial investment through financial surrogate intermediaries and higher return on financial assets. Therefore, managers should not ignore the potential negative effects during the process of digital transformation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Background: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology is increasingly being used for transcription in clinical contexts. Although there are numerous transcription services using ASR, few studies have compared the word error rate (WER) between different transcription services among different diagnostic groups in a mental health setting. There has also been little research into the types of words ASR transcriptions mistakenly generate or omit. Objective: This study compared the WER of 3 ASR transcription services (Amazon Transcribe [Amazon.com, Inc], Zoom-Otter AI [Zoom Video Communications, Inc], and Whisper [OpenAI Inc]) in interviews across 2 different clinical categories (controls and participants experiencing a variety of mental health conditions). These ASR transcription services were also compared with a commercial human transcription service, Rev (Rev.Com, Inc). Words that were either included or excluded by the error in the transcripts were systematically analyzed by their Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories. Methods: Participants completed a 1-time research psychiatric interview, which was recorded on a secure server. Transcriptions created by the research team were used as the gold standard from which WER was calculated. The interviewees were categorized into either the control group (n=18) or the mental health condition group (n=47) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The total sample included 65 participants. Brunner-Munzel tests were used for comparing independent sets, such as the diagnostic groupings, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for correlated samples when comparing the total sample between different transcription services. Results: There were significant differences between each ASR transcription service’s WER (P<.001). Amazon Transcribe’s output exhibited significantly lower WERs compared with the Zoom-Otter AI’s and Whisper’s ASR. ASR performances did not significantly differ across the 2 different clinical categories within each service (P>.05). A comparison between the human transcription service output from Rev and the best-performing ASR (Amazon Transcribe) demonstrated a significant difference (P<.001), with Rev having a slightly lower median WER (7.6%, IQR 5.4%-11.35 vs 8.9%, IQR 6.9%-11.6%). Heat maps and spider plots were used to visualize the most common errors in Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories, which were found to be within 3 overarching categories: Conversation, Cognition, and Function. Conclusions: Overall, consistent with previous literature, our results suggest that the WER between manual and automated transcription services may be narrowing as ASR services advance. These advances, coupled with decreased cost and time in receiving transcriptions, may make ASR transcriptions a more viable option within health care settings. However, more research is required to determine if errors in specific types of words impact the analysis and usability of these transcriptions, particularly for specific applications and in a variety of populations in terms of clinical diagnosis, literacy level, accent, and cultural origin. © Salman Seyedi, Emily Griner, Lisette Corbin, Zifan Jiang, Kailey Roberts, Luca Iacobelli, Aaron Milloy, Mina Boazak, Ali Bahrami Rad, Ahmed Abbasi, Robert O Cotes, Gari D Clifford."
"The emergence of the personal computer and internet in the last quarter of the 20th century has triggered the development of corpus linguistic studies that enable researchers to investigate big data in synchronic and diachronic settings. Scholars have developed Corpus tools to provide linguistic analysis features such as word lists, keywords, collocations, and concordances. In 2003, a lexicographer named Adam Kilgariff developed Sketch Engine, which provides more than 700 text corpora in monolingual and multilingual forms and enables users to create their corpus by crawling the data online or uploading the compiled corpus themselves. In the Indonesian context, Sketch Engine has yet to be used widely, even though this tool provides a promising opportunity in language research. This paper discusses 1) the linguistic features available in Sketch Engine, 2) recent language research articles utilizing Sketch Engine, and 3) possible opportunities and barriers for Indonesia's research. A conceptual and systematic review of corpus linguistics and Sketch Engine is provided to reach the objectives. The analysis found that Indonesian researchers have not contributed yet to the Indonesian corpus development in Sketch Engine. Possible barriers are as follows: 1) the subscription charge, 2) the unfamiliarity of the tool in corpus linguistic publication in Indonesia, and 3) the lack of understanding and application of corpus linguistics in Indonesian academia. Considering Indonesia as a multicultural country, vast opportunities in micro- and macro-linguistic studies will be beneficial to improve the research quality in the Indonesian context.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The acting technique “Demidov études” is a little-known method of the actor training, which was developed in the middle of the twentieth century by the Russian theater pedagogue and director N.V. Demidov. It is based on the principles of developing a student's creative intuition, spontaneity, organicity, improvisational and partnership abilities, which, in turn, contribute to achieving creative freedom. The focus of the research is the assessment of the creative freedom of students trained in the acting technique “Demidov études”. The object of the research is professional theater and film actors, amateur theaters actors and theater studios participants. The analysis of the influence of this technique on the development of spontaneity and the ability to improvise under unforeseen circumstances during a performance/ étude was carried out. The students practicing the étude method were surveyed regarding their sense of creative freedom. The factors obstructing the achievement of creative freedom were examined, as well as potential risks associated with the implementation of this method. The students’ opinion regarding the usefulness of this technique and its disadvantages were investigated. The results of the research showed that the acting technique “Demidov's Études” contributes to the development of students’ creative freedom. This technique allows actors to directly respond to the provided circumstances in the present, to feel and interact with a partner more subtly, to become more deeply involved in the process of creating a character, to free themselves from standard schemes and norms, and to show their individuality. However, the potential risks of this methodology include actors developing a dismissive attitude towards the author's text and a tendency to unjustifiably interrupt their scene partners. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In this article, we use convolutional neural network for extracting distinct character features and a recurrent neural network for handling character combinations within sequential data. By combining these models, we create a hybrid deep neural network consisting of three CNN layers followed by a bidirectional LSTM layer. This architecture effectively encodes input images and generates character probability matrices with which the connectionist temporal classification operation computes the loss function. Extensive experimentation with various parameter values allowed us to optimize our model, which we evaluated on the IAM dataset, yielding a reasonably low error rate.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Due to a programming error, the conditional effect of the perceived peer-norm on cyberbullying perpetration as a function of ingroup identification (1SD below the mean, at the mean, and 1SD above the mean) at different levels of ingroup prototypicality (1SD below the mean and 1SD above the mean) was miscalculated, rendering Figs. 2 and 3 incorrect and some beta values throughout. The authors wish to apologize for this mistake, which has not affected the qualitative nature of the results or any of the principal conclusions stated in the paper. The correct figures and modified betas throughout the text (highlighted in bold) are shown below. [pp. 266, 267] As far as the lower levels of ingroup prototypicality were concerned, the stronger the perceived peer-norm, the higher the frequency of cyberbullying perpetration, at higher, β^ =.259, p <.001, compared to the mean, β^ = 0.208, p <.001, and to lower levels of ingroup identification, β^ = 0.158, p <.001. As for the higher levels of ingroup prototypicality, again, the stronger the perceived peer-norm, the higher the frequency of cyberbullying perpetration at higher, β^ =.408, p <.001, compared to the mean, β^ = 0.305, p <.001, and to lower levels of ingroup identification, β^ = 0.203, p =.001. [p. 268, Ancillary analyses] Specifically, participants with lower vs. higher levels of ingroup identification and ingroup prototypicality, the former being less sensitive to the perceived peer-norm (i.e., positive scenario subgroup, β^s =.158, p <.001) than the latter (i.e., negative scenario subgroup, β^s =.408, p <.001). The comparison between the negative scenario subgroup in the referential informative social influence to the negative scenario subgroup in the informational social influence indicated an increased amount of predicted cyberbullying perpetration equal to 29% (β^sratio = 1.294, SE = 0.153, p <.001; see Fig. 3). The comparison between the positive scenario subgroup in the referential informative social influence to the positive scenario subgroup in the informational social influence indicated a decreased amount of predicted cyberbullying perpetration equal to 20% (β^s ratio = 0.795, SE = 0.113, p <.001).

"Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is one of key problems in field of natural language processing. Ambiguous word often has different meanings in different contexts. WSD is the process of determining semantic category of ambiguous word according to its context. It has a great impact on machine translation, speech recognition, topic detection, search engine, text classification, emotion analysis and so on. It is important for WSD task to extract effective discriminative features and design high-quality disambiguation models. This paper proposes a WSD method based on RegNet with Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and dilated convolution (ECADCRegNet). Ambiguous word is viewed as the center, and two units on the left and two units on the right of ambiguous word are selected. Then, word, part of speech and semantic categories of these four units are used as disambiguation features. Firstly, disambiguation features are vectorized and the result is input into RegNet space. Secondly, dilated convolution is used to extract discriminative features from words, parts of speech and semantic categories for constructing feature matrix. And ECA is introduced into the feature extraction layer. Thirdly, softmax function is used to calculate the probability of ambiguous word under each semantic category and the category with the largest one is selected. Training corpus of SemEval-2007: Task#5 is adopted to optimize the proposed network. Test corpus of Semeval-2007: Task#5 is used to test the performance of the proposed network. Experimental results show that average accuracy of the proposed method achieves 81.83%, which is higher than those of other methods. Authors"
"This article aims to describe evidence of change to the social–societal context seen from the cyber pragmatic perspective. The substantive data sources were texts on social media in which there were objects and data of this research. The data were collected by using the observation method equipped with note-taking techniques and recording techniques. Data were analyzed by applying the contextual analysis method. We applied the contextual analysis method or the extra lingual analysis method because of the cyberpragmatic perspective of this research with a virtual external context as the main determinant of its meaning. Before the analysis, data that were classified and typified properly were triangulated with the expert and consulted on relevant theories. The results show that the social–societal context element changes occur in the following context elements: (1) setting, (2) participants, (3) ends, and (4) instrumentalities. Setting element changes occurred in the aspects of venue, time, and atmosphere. The instrumental element changed in the aspects of the kinds of tools and the range of errand communication. The participant element changed in the aspects of perception of gender, age, and social status, and the last element, changed in the aspects of monodimensional goal manifestation and multidimensional goal manifestation. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"Background: Past research in the Western context found that people with dementia search for digital dementia information in peer-reviewed medical research articles, dementia advocacy and medical organizations, and blogs written by other people with dementia. This past work also demonstrated that people with dementia do not perceive English digital dementia information as emotionally or cognitively accessible. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the readability; linguistic, psychological, and emotional characteristics; and target audiences of digital dementia information. We conducted a textual analysis of 3 different types of text-based digital dementia information written in English: 300 medical articles, 35 websites, and 50 blogs. Methods: We assessed the text’s readability using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measurements, as well as tone, analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, and word frequencies using a natural language processing tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Generator. We also conducted a thematic analysis to categorize the target audiences for each information source and used these categorizations for further statistical analysis. Results: The median Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score and Flesch Reading Ease score for all types of information (N=1139) were 12.1 and 38.6, respectively, revealing that the readability scores of all 3 information types were higher than the minimum requirement. We found that medical articles had significantly (P=.05) higher word count and analytical thinking scores as well as significantly lower clout, authenticity, and emotional tone scores than websites and blogs. Further, blogs had significantly (P=.48) higher word count and authenticity scores but lower analytical scores than websites. Using thematic analysis, we found that most of the blogs (156/227, 68.7%) and web pages (399/612, 65.2%) were targeted at people with dementia. Website information targeted at a general audience had significantly lower readability scores. In addition, website information targeted at people with dementia had higher word count and lower emotional tone ratings. The information on websites targeted at caregivers had significantly higher clout and lower authenticity scores. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is an abundance of digital dementia information written in English that is targeted at people with dementia, but this information is not readable by a general audience. This is problematic considering that people with <12 years of education are at a higher risk of developing dementia. Further, our findings demonstrate that digital dementia information written in English has a negative tone, which may be a contributing factor to the mental health crisis many people with dementia face after receiving a diagnosis. Therefore, we call for content creators to lower readability scores to make the information more accessible to a general audience and to focus their efforts on providing information in a way that does not perpetuate overly negative narratives of dementia. ©Margi Engineer, Sushant Kot, Emma Dixon."
"Online reviews are essential to consumers' decision-making when purchasing products on e-commerce platforms. Most of the existing research conducts sentiment analysis on online reviews, yet the disclosure characteristics of these reviews have not received sufficient attention. Therefore, this paper evaluated the information characteristics of online reviews using review length, readability, redundancy, and specificity indicators. By collecting 18,131 online clothing reviews, we applied Latent Dirichlet allocation to divide the review texts into nine topics. We also investigate the relationship between review text characteristics and review sentiment and verify the robustness of the results using different regression models. We conclude that a review with more words, higher redundancy, lower fog index, and lower specificity tends to express a more positive emotion of the review. Our research will help e-commerce platforms construct general review writing guidelines to improve consumer satisfaction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Remote sensing cross-modal text-image retrieval (RSCTIR) has recently received unprecedented attention due to its advantages of flexible input and efficient query on enormous remote sensing (RS) images. However, most RSCTIR methods focus obsessively on the cross-modal semantic alignment between text and image modalities and are easily stuck in the dilemma of information redundancy, leading to the degradation of retrieval accuracy. To address the issues, we construct a novel RSCTIR framework based on mask-guided relation modeling with entity loss (MGRM-EL), to fully explore uni-modal feature learning on entities and relations in the cross-modal model learning process. Specifically, we take advantage of the Transformer encoder architecture for its ability of capturing long-distance dependencies from the global view, and build two uni-modal (visual and textual) Transformer encoders combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the spatial inter-region relations of images as well as long-term inter-word relations of texts for prominent feature embedding of visual and semantic representations. A mask-guided attention strategy is further introduced to learn the salient regions and words, with the aim of enhancing the RSCTIR model&#x2019;s uni-modal learning ability and eliminating unnecessary and redundant information of each modality. Unlike existing methods that simply compute the semantic similarity between images and texts on the loss functions, we present a novel uni-modal entity loss, which treats each image as an image entity and merges similar texts into a text entity, to learn the independent distribution of entities in each modality. We conduct extensive experiments on public RSCTIR benchmarks including RSICD and RSITMD datasets, which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method on the RSCTIR task. IEEE"
"Background: Health care providers need a better understanding of virtual care to recognise and use it for service delivery. Aim: To provide a more comprehensive definition of the concept of virtual care. Method: This study was conducted based on Walker and Avant's concept analysis method. A comprehensive review of the published texts in English from 2012 to 2022 was performed using the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, Ovid, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases. Results: The main aspects and attributes of virtual care, including the use of any information and communication technology in various formats such as platforms, telephone calls, messages, email consultation, remote monitoring, secure and two-way digital communication between health care providers and patients, the possibility of providing remote care synchronously or asynchronously, more interaction between patients and caregivers, the possibility of transferring information between patients and health care providers and within the teams themselves, symptom management, sending diagnostic results in the form of video visits, and providing follow-up care, are attributes that distinguish virtual care from telehealth, telemedicine and other methods of providing remote healthcare services. Conclusion: Considering the positive and negative consequences of implementing virtual care, the findings of this study developed a basis for an operational definition of the concept so that providers can understand the meaning of virtual care and consider it when providing virtual care to patients. The findings of this study can be used in many international and national contexts in the health care system and in future studies on interventions to increase the use of virtual care. © 2023 Nordic College of Caring Science."
"Online platforms allow individuals to connect with others, share experiences, and find communities with similar interests, providing a sense of belonging and reducing feelings of isolation. Numerous previous studies examined the content of online health communities to gain insights into the sentiments surrounding mental health conditions. However, there is a noticeable gap in the research landscape, as no study has specifically concentrated on conducting an in-depth analysis or providing a comprehensive visualization of Bipolar disorder. Therefore, this study aimed to address this gap by examining the Bipolar subreddit online community, where we collected 1,460,447 posts as plain text documents for analysis. By employing LDA topic modeling and sentiment analysis, we found that the Bipolar disorder online community on Reddit discussed various aspects of the condition, including symptoms, mood swings, diagnosis, and medication. Users shared personal experiences, challenges, and coping strategies, seeking support and connection. Discussions related to therapy and medication were prevalent, emphasizing the importance of finding suitable therapists and managing medication side effects. The online community serves as a platform for seeking help, advice, and information, highlighting the role of social support in managing bipolar disorder. This study enhances our understanding of individuals living with bipolar disorder and provides valuable insights and feedback for researchers developing mental health interventions.

"In recent research, the effectiveness of text clustering is the long-term pursuit goal, because the same clustering documents have the maximum correlation and internal connection, this technology can simplify the user's text processing process. This research study focuses on the very large-scale short text clustering with a case study of legal documents. First, the normal size short text clustering algorithm is studied, the encapsulation method is used, and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) algorithm is selected. Then, after finding the shortcomings, the 2-step algorithm for very large short text clustering is proposed. First, the text similarity reduction serves as the pre-processing, and this study applies the iteration function together with the Simhash algorithm to achieve the goal. Second, the class-centric algorithm extension method is designed to effectively cluster massive information. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by experiment in terms of time and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE."
"With the aim of overcoming the limitations in feature extraction capability, OOV (out-of-vacabulary) and polysemous word in Chinese text sentiment analysis, dual attention gated recurrent neural network (AW-Att-BiGRU) with word and character information fusion was proposed. Firstly, character and word level vector are taken as input to the model to obtain semantic representation to the maximum extent. Then, characters and words with obvious emotional characteristics are given higher weights through the attention mechanism, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the emotional tendencies within the text and enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Based on the experimental results using the Tan Songbo Hotel review dataset, the proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 94.56%, and the accuracy rate on Weibo review dataset is 93.87%, which improves the performance compared with a single model and has certain application value. © 2023 IEEE."

"Software systems behave abnormally due to bugs when it comes into the operational phase. Lack of proper understanding of customer requirements, implementation, knowledge, wrong algorithmic designing, and other issue is also the reason for bug production. To fix those flaws, developers request to the users for feedback. Users have had issues with the software systems that have been released. Users are encouraged to submit their issues to issue-tracking systems such as Bugzilla, Mantis, Google Code Issue Tracker, GitHub Issue Tracker, and Jira to improve the next version of the product and meet user needs. Manual prioritization is time-consuming and inconvenient. In this research paper, we propose using sentiment analysis to anticipate the report's priority. This is the first time the sentiment-based approach used for a bug report to prioritize prediction on open-source projects. First, we take the bug report summary and use natural language pre-processing techniques to clean the text and pre-process the bug report. Second, sentiment analysis is applied to clean texts that contain sentiments of terms. Third, we use TF-IDF to construct a feature vector for bug reports, fourth, we used resampling techniques to balance the dataset, and then we used different machine learning classifiers to train historical data namely Bugzilla open-source projects to forecast their priority. The proposed method we have used improves the performance of the classifier with sentiment comparison to without sentiment on average f-score 2–10%. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden."
"Objectives: The study aimed to identify the dilemma of resilience for the donors and the hosts in response for the Syrian refugee crisis in the case of Jordan and the European Union (EU) and how Jordan and the EU attempt to tackle it. Methods: The study was conducted and built primarily upon textual analysis of secondary data of various texts from official European and Jordanian websites, news reports, and scholarly literature on resilience, as well as document analysis of different EU-Jordan official policies including their bilateral and multilateral agreements to trace the goals for Jordan and the EU within these policies,the shift towards resilience as a priority for the EU, the new mechanisms and tools the EU uses to build resilience in Jordan, and how it might be a better strategy, at the same time, dilemma for them both. Results: The results of the study showed that resilience may appear as a dilemma; however, the EU and Jordan are working to resolve it through focusing on its bright side. More importantly, its role in preserving Jordan's social cohesion and its stability makes it a better security strategy than providing humanitarian assistance. Conclusions: The study recommends the need for strategies to enhance resilience in both Jordan and the EU. Jordan can boost exports to the EU by raising awareness about the rules of origin scheme, especially among remote area industries. The EU should find a balance between its humanitarian and political efforts in the region. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan."
"Document analysis and recognition is a crucial technique for automating the input process of forms, receipts, documents at banks, governments, companies. With demands in both research and industry, there are available datasets for Document Analysis and Recognition in English, Chinese, Arabic, and Indic. However, there is no publicly datasets for Vietnamese Document Analysis and Recognition. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for Vietnamese Document analysis named VNDoc, which aims to set up a standard dataset for researching and developing Vietnamese Document Analysis Systems. The dataset contains 226 documents scanned from mobile phones and scan machines. The documents are collected from diverse categories such as legal and administrations, invoices, resumes, handwriting forms, and so on, which target various applications. At the first stage, we provide ground truth for text lines, which allow performing research in text detection and layout analysis. Moreover, we describe a statistical analysis of text length and bounding box in the dataset and initial experiments for the existing methods for text detection. We are going to provide text transcriptions and available for research communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"In 2020 and 2021, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented globally to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. This study is aimed to assess the impact of NPIs on the public mental health in Ireland by drawing on two datasets: (1) data of 43,433 chats initiated at Text About It, a free text-based mental health crisis service in Ireland, and (2) emotional well-being indicators reported by respondents of the Amárach public opinion survey, carried out on behalf of the Department of Health, Ireland. Our analysis reveals that COVID-19-related chats drove overall volumes of chats to Text About It between June 2020 to July 2021. Surges in text volumes immediately prior to new restrictions in Ireland indicate an association between the announcements of the new restrictions and a sudden rise in mental health concerns. Through segmented regression, seven distinct breakpoints were identified across weekly chat volumes at Text About It, the majority of which co-occurred with dates when considerable changes in NPIs were made. Significant high cross-correlation is found between emotional well-being variables in the Amárach dataset and the number of weekly COVID-19 related texts to Text About It. This analysis confirms the value of Text About It as community surveillance indicator for population mental health. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Geolocated social media data hold a hitherto untapped potential for exploring the relationship between user mobility and their interests at a large scale. Using geolocated Twitter data from Nigeria, we provide a feasibility study that demonstrates how the linkage of (1) a trajectory analysis of Twitter users' geolocation and (2) natural language processing of Twitter users' text content can reveal information about the interests of migrants. After identifying migrants via a trajectory analysis, we train a language model to automatically detect the topics of the migrants' tweets. Biases of manual labelling are circumvented by learning community-defined topics from a Nigerian web forum. Results suggest that differences in users' mobility correlate with varying interests in several topics, most notably religion. We find that Twitter data can be a flexible source for exploring the link between users' mobility and interests in large-scale analyses of urban populations. The joint use of spatial techniques and text analysis enables migration researchers to (a) study migrant perspectives in greater detail than is possible with census data and (b) at a larger scale than is feasible with interviews. Thereby, it provides a valuable complement to interviews, surveys and censuses, and holds a large potential for further research. © 2023 The Authors.

"Purpose – To use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore how people feel and what they share online about their experiences with food. In addition, to learn how these experiences have evolved recently, differences before and during the crisis COVID-19 will be explored. Methodology/Design/Approach – A total of 35,001 reviews of restaurants and local cuisine establishments near tourist attractions in the city of Ayutthaya, Thailand, were extracted from the Google Local Guide platform. Several NLP techniques were used to analyse the text data, including sentiment analysis, word cloud analysis, and the N-gramme model. Findings – The results reveal travellers’ hidden sentiments toward dining experiences. Key attributes of experience sharing related to food activities in online reviews were identified both before and after COVID-19. From a theoretical perspective, the findings are relevant for researchers to recognise tourists’ behaviour in sharing local food experiences. From a practical perspective, decision makers will have a better understanding of tourist behaviour to develop and implement appropriate strategies. Originality of the research – This study is the first to analyse and interpret online reviews on Google Maps platform by applying text mining and sentiment analysis in gastronomic tourism research, especially in the context of COVID-19. © 2023, University of Rijeka.

"Aims: To test differential outcomes between three 6-month text-messaging interventions to reduce at-risk drinking in help-seeking adults. Design: A three-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial with 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Setting: United States. A fully remote trial without human contact, with participants recruited primarily via social media outlets. Participants: Seven hundred and twenty-three adults (mean = 39.9 years, standard deviation = 10.0; 62.5% female) seeking to reduce their drinking were allocated to 6 months of baseline ‘tailored statically’ messaging (TS; n = 240), ‘tailored adaptive’ messaging (TA; n = 239) or ‘drink tracking’ messaging (DT; n = 244). Interventions: TS consisted of daily text messages to reduce harmful drinking that were tailored to demographics and alcohol use. TA consisted of daily, tailored text messages that were also adapted based on goal achievement and proactive prompts. DT consisted of a weekly assessment for self-reported drinking over the past 7 days. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was weekly sum of standard drinks (SSD) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included drinks per drinking day (DDD), number of drinking days (NDD) per week and heavy drinking days (HDD) at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Findings: At 6 months, compared with DT, TA resulted in significant SSD reductions of 16.2 (from 28.7 to 12.5) drinks [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71, 0.91] using intent-to-treat analysis. TA also resulted in significant improvements in DDD (aRR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.77–0.92) and drinking days per week (b = −0.39; 95% CI = −0.67, –0.10), but not HDD compared with DT at 6 months. TA was not significantly different from TS at any time-point, except DDD at 6 months. All groups made improvements in SSD at 12-month follow-up compared with baseline with an average reduction of 12.9 drinks per week across groups. Conclusions: Automated tailored mobile messaging interventions are scalable solutions that can reduce weekly alcohol consumption in remote help-seeking drinkers over time. © 2023 Society for the Study of Addiction."
"The corpus of this study is the text From Pará to Manaos, chapter V of the book A Journey in Brazil, by Elizabeth Agassiz, published in 1868 by Ticknor and Fields and translated from English to Portuguese in 2023, by Silvia Benchimol to compose the publication Traduzindo a Amazônia III. In addition to the centripetal property, which makes the writings about this work converge to its textual, social, ideological, narrative, linguistic and aesthetic elements, we emphasize its centrifugal power that provokes, from the center - the text - movements in different directions. The language meanders through different discursive genres in an orchestrated way - travel diary, report, letters, footnotes - accompanied by the translation. In the meticulous descriptions that reveal the writer’s enchantment for the mystery and exuberance of the forest, the language is strongly marked by literary and poetic aesthetics, fostering images with photographic precision that transport us to those places. No less evident are the scientific references that spill over the text, a rich and specialized glossary. The translation receives the source text and re-conceives it in another language in the same locus of the events, providing the translator with a dip in memories and facts, reconstructing personal experiences in the act of rewriting. © 2023.

"Sentiment analysis of people’s opinions finds widespread application in numerous business and decision-making situations. Despite social media’s informal nature for sharing viewpoints, it has now become a prevalent tool in various business and decision-making contexts. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, encompasses the utilization of techniques such as text analysis, computational linguistics, natural language processing, and even biometrics to analyze and interpret sentiments, opinions, and emotions expressed within textual data. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of this data using a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and decision trees. We are proposing a new machine learning model, called a hybrid feature selection-based model, for identifying the sentiment polarity of statements. This model is different from other machine learning models because of its unique architecture. It uses 16 different linguistic features in its hidden layers. To validate and fine-tune the behavior of this algorithm, we employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. This technique has been utilized in a wide variety of research projects, and it has also been combined with other methodologies to solve decision-making challenges. By integrating various linguistic features, our model demonstrates enhanced performance compared to other state-of-the-art models, resulting in an improvement of up to 2.8% in Accuracy and 3% in terms of the weighted F1-score. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"FAKE data and news has increased rapidly to a large mass of people than ever before in this technology era, the main reasons coming from the direct messaging platform and rise of social media. Methods of false information subject matter introspection are innovative, varied, and exciting.

The study’s solution is premediated to be used in actual social networking and media platforms and reduce the negative user experience of receiving false information from unreliable and untrustworthy resources. Using different algorithms, data cleaning and reprocessing such as data removal using PCA (principal component analysis), are used before vectorization them into sequence vectors using TF-IDFs (Terms frequency inverse document frequency) or dummy encoding for handling categorical data respectively. Output from the different algorithms are representing that model is trained with news data help in achieve maximum accuracy with different tools and different algorithms while model trained with news title need lower evaluation time to achieve a better efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"It is a classical research issue in bibliometrics that what factors affect the citation frequency of academic articles. Previous studies have mainly focused on the relationship between the content or formal characteristics of articles and the citations they received, while few studies shed light on the issue from the perspective of readability, which is an integral component of the content characteristics of an academic article. A critical factor concerning the efficiency of knowledge dissemination and the recognition of the research is to what extent readability affects a reader's understanding and absorbing of the information in the article. This study aims to examine the impact of text readability of an article on the citations it received. The articles published from 2016 to 2020 in the well-known journals of Chinese library and information science were used as the research sample. The readability of the research sample was measured by the R-value algorithm, which is proposed by JING Xiyu of National Kaohsiung Normal University. The R-value is the most scientific readability indicator in analyzing Chinese test since it was designed to evaluate the readability of Chinese textbooks for primary and secondary school. Meanwhile, the fact that an article uses or does not use a compound title, formulas, tables, and figures was used as four complementary variables to measure the readability of the research sample. Additionally, the quality and authority characteristics of articles were under control to investigate the impact of readability on the citations of articles. The co-authorship and the number of references were used as the quality indicator of an article. The journal prestige, author's job title, and institutional hierarchy were used to control the halo effect of citations received for an article. The publication age was used to control the cumulative effect of citations over time. It has been found that the readability R-value of articles, whether or not using a compound title, and the presence or absence of formulas and tables in the text has a significant impact on citation frequency, while the presence or absence of figures has no significant impact on citation frequency. The study verified that readability does play a substantial role in the impact of an article in the Chinese scientific communication context. Furthermore, the research data shows that authoritative factors, time effects, and references number have significant impact on citation frequency in the Chinese scientific context, and the impact effect is relatively robust. However, co-authorship has a very limited effect on increasing citations. The results indicate that it is important for Chinese researchers to improve their academic writing skills for better readability and peer recognition as well as endeavor to publish results in higher-level journals to gain more attention from the academic community. 3 tabs. 83 refs. © 2023, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

"Introduction: The opioid epidemic in the United States continues to result in an increasing number of deaths and is increasingly dominated by fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. As a result, first responders are likely to come into contact with fentanyl-containing substances daily. Concerns persist regarding occupational exposure resulting in intoxication. We performed a systematic review to describe occupational illnesses from fentanyl and its analogs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to assess the danger of occupational exposure to fentanyl. The PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health databases were queried to identify occupational fentanyl exposures. Studies included were single case reports, case series, observational studies, controlled studies, and abstracts from scientific presentations. We reviewed articles meeting the eligibility criteria and abstracted outcome data. Outcomes included study design, number of study subjects and study demographics, description of exposure, personal protective equipment used, duration of symptoms, illness developed, medical evaluation performed, treatment provided, hospitalizations, deaths, drug testing performed, and any situation review performed to prevent illness, analytical confirmation of the identity of culprit agent, and concentrations of drug in serum/blood. Results: Our search yielded 454 citations after deduplication. After abstract and text review, 12 unique reports met the inclusion criteria. All identified studies were observational studies. Ten of the 12 were Health Hazard Evaluation reports from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; two reports describe the same exposure case. There were no reported instances of comprehensive drug testing using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in exposed first responders. Among first responders possibly exposed to fentanyl or fentanyl analogs, none were admitted to the hospital, and only three first responders received naloxone. The three officers who received naloxone lacked recommended personal protective equipment and had subjective improvement of symptoms following naloxone. There were no instances of severe respiratory depression requiring assisted ventilation or hospital admission. Among forensic laboratory technicians, only one instance of detectable concentrations of fentanyl in urine was reported, and there were no instances of symptomatic cases. Conclusions: Among published reports of 27 first responders with symptoms after possible ambient fentanyl exposure, symptoms, recorded physical findings, and vital signs were inconsistent with acute opioid toxicity. Breaches in the recommended use of personal protective equipment appeared common. Only three persons received naloxone, although none had plausible effects of fentanyl. No suspected exposure to fentanyl led to hospitalization or death. Based on these low-quality data, there were no plausible opioid effects from ambient exposure to suspected fentanyl. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Throughout the Sasanian era (224-650/1 CE), Zoroastrian Fire Foundations were some of the most significant landowners in Iran. The sources represented in this study reveal that Fire Foundations were among the most prominent organizations in late antique Iran, actively utilizing slaves and their labour in various social, economic and religious contexts. This article studies the religious, social, legal, and economic aspects of slaves in general, and slaves of Fire Foundations in particular throughout the Sasanian period. Drawing on Middle Persian legal and religious texts, the article examines three interrelated themes: the Fire Foundations characterized as slavers, and the function of priests in mobilizing their immense landed estates, income, and the utilization of slave labour; the relationship between free persons and slaves; and the link between the Fire Foundations and slaves. Analyzing these key questions and the considerable involvement of clerics in all these aspects enables us to discern the structural role of priests in Fire Foundations’ use of slavery and within the broader framework of the Sasanian economy. Through this analysis, the article highlights the close administrative and financial ties binding the priesthood and the monarchy during Sasanian Iran. © 2023 The Author(s).

"In the age of social media, detecting depression through user messages poses challenges due to recognition and trends. However, this project focuses on constructing a deep learning model using Twitter data to predict depression based on users' tweets. The current approaches like RNNs, LSTMs are inefficient in extracting contextual and sequential information from data in low compute environments. The solution proposed aims to incorporate the upsides from both CNNs and LSTMs to better extract features. Firstly, Twitter data is collected to identify relevant linguistic features for depression detection. Carefully characterized features are selected to capture subtle nuances in the content. Secondly, a comprehensive analysis is conducted, considering correlation significance, hidden topics, and word frequencies extracted from the text, which play a vital role in depression detection. These analyzed features are then fed into pre-trained CNN, LSTM, and RNN models. The results indicate that the RNN model outperforms the CNN-LSTM model, achieving an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.29% in detecting depression from posted tweets. By utilizing remembering networks and deep learning classifiers, the model can effectively classify, analyze, and predict data, providing insights into users' mental health. This research highlights the potential of using social media data and deep learning techniques to gain valuable insights into individuals' emotional well-being, ultimately leading to better mental health support and intervention strategies.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Sentiment analysis is a tool to identify and measure the emotion in a piece of text. Negation handling is an important aspect of natural language processing (NLP) for Twitter data. It is a process of correctly interpreting the sentences containing negation words, such as, ""never"", ""no"", ""neither"" and so on. Negation words are used in machine learning to express negative sentiment or indicate the absence of something. In this article, a negation handling technique using deep learning models. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification is proposed. The system is evaluated on SemEval-2017 dataset. The classification performance is improved by using ANN and CNN on the negative tweets. The study aims to improve the classification accuracy by considering negation words in the text. The paper compares the performance of ANNs and CNNs in handling negation words and evaluates them on the tweets data. This study provides insights into the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques for negation handling in sentiment analysis and highlights the importance of considering negation words in the text for improved sentiment analysis performance. The proposed negation strategy attains a superior performance accuracy over machine learning models by preventing misclassified tweets. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

"Classifying Programming Languages scripts is very important task for several reasons such as: automated analysis, code maintenance, code search, quality assurance, and code understanding; this process is similar to processing natural languages, especially high-level languages like Python, Java, C#, C, C++, PHP, JavaScript, and others. Leveraging natural language processing concepts, this research explores the application of the Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) algorithm to identify and classify programming languages used in source code files. MNB is a relatively simple and fast algorithm for text classification. The study utilizes a dataset comprising 12 programming languages and consists of 12,003 samples, totaling 396,090 lines of code. The MNB algorithm is trained on this diverse dataset, and its performance in classifying programming language source code is evaluated. The results of the study demonstrate an impressive accuracy rate of 95.09% in accurately identifying and classifying programming languages. This high accuracy highlights the effectiveness of the applied NLP techniques, specifically the MNB algorithm, in the classification task. The findings of this research have significant implications for multiprogramming language editors such as Visual Studio Code and Notepad+ or any programming editor. With the automatic recognition of programming languages enabled by this approach, users can conveniently paste source code into these editors, and the system will automatically identify and classify the programming language being used. This functionality enhances the user experience and streamlines the coding process, particularly in multi-language development environments. © 2023 Lavoisier. All rights reserved."
"Background: This qualitative study aimed to understand how early adopting health care organizations (HCOs) implement the documentation of patients’ disability status and accommodation needs in the electronic health record (EHR). Methods: The authors conducted qualitative interviews with HCOs that had active or past initiatives to implement systematic collection of disability status in the EHR. The interviews elicited participants’ current experiences, desired features of a standard EHR build, and challenges and successes. A team-based analysis approach was used to review and summarize quotations to identify themes and categorize text that exemplified identified themes. Results: Themes identified from the interviews included “why” organizations collected disability status; of “what” their EHR build consisted, including who collected, how often data were collected, and what data were collected; and “how” organizations were implementing systematic collection. The main purpose for collection of disability status and accommodation needs was to prepare for patients with disabilities. Due to this priority, participants believed collection should (1) occur prior to patients’ clinical encounters, (2) be conducted regularly, (3) use standardized language, and (4) be available in a highly visible location in the EHR. Leadership support to integrate collection into existing workflows was essential for success. Conclusion: Patients with disabilities experience significant disparities in the receipt of equitable health care services. To provide equitable care, HCOs need to systematically collect disability status and accommodation needs in the EHR to ensure that they are prepared to provide equitable care to all patients with disabilities. © 2023 The Joint Commission"
"Businesses constantly strive to build organizational capacity to use data strategically. As a result, there is a growing demand for business analytics professionals. While higher education systems worldwide have been adapting to build competencies, they must meet employees' expectations. Curriculum design for delivering business analytics competencies remains a challenge due to the rapidly evolving nature of business analytics as a discipline. The paper aims to decode the industry expectations for the Business Analytics profile. This study investigates the skills employers value by analyzing job descriptions. We use a text-mining approach to understand the weightage of different skills and mine skill clusters within business analytics roles. The core skill clusters are hard skills related to Big data, Business Intelligence, and analytical techniques. Results also suggest that traditional machine learning (ML) skills, typically expected in a data science profile, are also being sought after in a business analytics role. Surprisingly soft communication and stakeholder management skills are also emerging as essential skills for business analytics roles. This study provides a better understanding by investigating the interplay between the demand for skills in the job market and curriculum development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"With the increasing severity of user privacy leaks in online social networks (OSNs), existing privacy protection technologies have difficulty meeting the diverse privacy protection needs of users. Therefore, privacy-aware (PA) for the text data that users post on OSNs has become a current research focus. However, most existing PA algorithms for OSN users only provide the types of privacy disclosures rather than the specific locations of disclosures. Furthermore, although named entity recognition (NER) technology can extract specific locations of privacy text, it has poor recognition performance for nested and interest privacy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a PA framework based on the extraction of OSN privacy information content. The framework can automatically perceive the privacy information shared by users in OSNs and accurately locate which parts of the text are leaking sensitive information. Firstly, we combine the roformerBERT model, BI_LSTM model, and global_pointer algorithm to construct a direct privacy entity recognition (DPER) model for solving the specific privacy location recognition and entity nesting problems. Secondly, we use the roformerBERT model and UniLM framework to construct an interest privacy inference (IPI) model for interest recognition and to generate interpretable text that supports this interest. Finally, we constructed a dataset of 13,000 privacy-containing texts for experimentation. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the DPER model can reach 91.80%, while that of the IPI model can reach 98.3%. Simultaneously, we compare the proposed model with recent methods. The analysis of the results indicates that the proposed model exhibits better performance than previous methods.  © 2023 Gan Liu et al."
"The moral values present in classical texts are only implicitly codified and are a form of intangible cultural heritage. In this paper, we focus on capturing the perceptions of these references of values, with the aim to study how they evolve over space and time. To this end, we present our approach that consists of a meta-model and two intertwined design processes for the creation of a knowledge graph capable of capturing an integrated representation of both values and perceptions. In particular, we illustrate how the input collected from different activities with the general public can feed the graph to represent multiple and possibly divergent perceptions of values in classical texts. Our meta-model allows for the integration of data from both established scientific techniques such as expert annotations on the one hand, and on the other from standard tests, social media activity, visual representations and games. The proposed approach gives practical means to make explicit both historical and current perceptions of values in classical works of art. Our approach and the resulting knowledge graph enable the comparative analysis of values and their perceptions over space and time. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"This study investigates the general public’s concerns about COVID-19 vaccination by their comments in social media (YouTube) with NLP techniques and time series analysis. A set of keywords are traced in order to better understand the changes in public opinion and responses at different stages of the pandemic, as well as the influences of fake news. These keywords were extracted from Macau netizens’ online comments based on word frequency, TF-IDF, and TextRank. It is observed that the misinformation dissipated abruptly after initiation of mass vaccination in Macau. We account for this change by the Prospect Theory. This study has shown that NLP techniques can assist in discourse analysis of people’s perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination, and people’s linguistic behaviours have been captured by the extracted keywords through text mining and time series analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Dromedary camels are the preferable livestock species in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Most of the world’s camel populations are managed under a subsistence/extensive system maintained by migratory pastoralists but intensification is getting more frequent. Even though recently the welfare of camels has been receiving more attention, in many countries there are no regulations to protect their health and welfare. The objectives of this article were to explore the main research topics related to camel welfare, their distribution over time and to highlight research gaps. A literature search was performed to identify records published in English from January 1980 to March 2023 on Dromedary camel welfare via Scopus®, using “Camel welfare,” “Camel behaviour,” “She-camel” and “Camel management” as search words. A total of 234 records were retained for analysis after automatic and manual screening procedures. Descriptive statistics, text mining (TM) and topic analysis (TA) were performed. The result shows that even though there were fluctuations between years, records on camel welfare have increased exponentially over time. Asia was the region where most of the corresponding authors were located. The first five most frequent words were, “milk,” “calv,” “behaviour,” “femal,” and “breed,” the least frequent word was “stabl.” TA resulted in the five most relevant topics dealing with “Calf management and milk production,” “Camel health and management system,” “Female and male reproduction,” “Camel behaviour and feeding,” and “Camel welfare.” The topics that contained the oldest records were “female and male reproduction” and “camel health and management system” (in 1980 and 1983, respectively), while the topic named “camel behaviour and feeding” had the first article published in 2000. Overall, even though topics related to camel behaviour and welfare are receiving more attention from academia, research is still needed to fully understand how to safeguard welfare in Dromedary camels.

"Introduction: Trust has emerged as a prevalent construct to describe relationships between people and between people and technology in myriad domains. Across disciplines, researchers have relied on many different questionnaires to measure trust. The degree to which these questionnaires differ has not been systematically explored. In this paper, we use a word-embedding text analysis technique to identify the differences and common themes across the most used trust questionnaires and provide guidelines for questionnaire selection. Methods: A review was conducted to identify the existing trust questionnaires. In total, we included 46 trust questionnaires from three main domains (i.e., Automation, Humans, and E-commerce) with a total of 626 items measuring different trust layers (i.e., Dispositional, Learned, and Situational). Next, we encoded the words within each questionnaire using GloVe word embeddings and computed the embedding for each questionnaire item, and for each questionnaire. We reduced the dimensionality of the resulting dataset using UMAP to visualize these embeddings in scatterplots and implemented the visualization in a web app for interactive exploration of the questionnaires (https://areen.shinyapps.io/Trust_explorer/). Results: At the word level, the semantic space serves to produce a lexicon of trust-related words. At the item and questionnaire level, the analysis provided recommendation on questionnaire selection based on the dispersion of questionnaires’ items and at the domain and layer composition of each questionnaire. Along with the web app, the results help explore the semantic space of trust questionnaires and guide the questionnaire selection process. Discussion: The results provide a novel means to compare and select trust questionnaires and to glean insights about trust from spoken dialog or written comments.

"Tobacco use during and around pregnancy can significantly increase the risk of stillbirth, congenital disabilities, premature birth, and low-weight birth. To establish maternal tobacco prevention and cessation frameworks for primary care and dental providers and to facilitate cross-national learning, this scoping review aims: 1) to analyze the body of literature on maternal tobacco prevention and cessation frameworks, guidelines, recommendations, and strategies at the international and national level; 2) to identify common core elements; and 3) to identify gaps in the literature, and propose future initiatives and policy development directions. A systematic database search based on the JBI methodology and corresponding PRISMA-ScR guidelines will be conducted from January 2015 to August 2023. Searches in different databases will be combined with an expert survey among the members of the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA) – Oral Health, Tobacco Control, and the Women, Adolescent, and Children’s Working Groups to evaluate the search outcomes and add maternal tobacco prevention and cessation frameworks, guidelines, recommendations, or strategies. Using a systematic review tool to support the screening, two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of all articles, in order to include the relevant ones for full-text screening, and an independent third author will resolve conflicts, if there is any discrepancy between the two independent reviewers’ search. After a full-text review, data extraction will be conducted for analysis. Descriptive analyses include the publication year, country, legal quality, and target group addressed. A narrative synthesis will describe the scope and content of the frameworks, guidelines, recommendations, and strategies. The scoping review will serve as a stepping-stone to creating a WFPHA policy resolution on tobacco prevention and cessation framework for women of childbearing age led by the WFPHA Oral Health, Tobacco Control and the Women, Adolescent, and Children’s Working Group members. This WFPHA policy resolution ‘Maternal Tobacco Cessation and Prevention Recommendations for Primary Care Providers and Dental Providers’ will be forwarded to the WFPHA General Council and the General Assembly for approval and will be disseminated to the WFPHA public health association members. Ultimately, this recommendation will be used by each national public health association to consider integrating it into their maternal health strategy. © 2023 Nagdeo K.P. et al."
"Open-source intelligence is gaining popularity these days due to the development of social networks. There is more and more information in the public domain. Twitter is one of the most popular social networks, so it’s worth analyzing its information. It was chosen to analyze the dependence of changes in the number of likes, reposts, quotes, and retweets on the aggressiveness of the post text for a separate profile since this information may be important not only for the owner of the channel on the social network but also for other studies that somehow affect user accounts and their behavior on the social network. also, the task of this work was a detailed analysis and evaluation of the capabilities of the tweety library and situations in which it can be effectively applied. also, the creation and description of a compiled neural network, the purpose of which is to predict changes in the number of likes, reposts, quotes, and retweets from the aggressiveness of the post text for a separate profile. © 2023, Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

"Purpose: The Queensland Children's Hospital Paediatric Optometry Alignment Program commenced with a pilot phase to assess its feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability. This study identified the barriers that hinder effective interprofessional collaboration and the facilitators that contribute to its success, and assessed changes in optometrists' satisfaction since the pilot phase of the collaborative care programme. Methods: Qualitative deductive and inductive content analysis was applied to open-ended free-text survey responses collected in 2018 from the optometrists involved in the Program's pilot phase. The responses were coded using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to categorise barriers and facilitators into key themes. Key behavioural determinants were mapped to the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour) elements of the Behaviour Change Wheel model to identify intervention strategies. Intervention recommendations were derived from behaviour change mapping and compared with programme quality improvement initiatives. A cross-sectional explanatory survey informed by the TDF was conducted within the current 2023 cohort, and a longitudinal comparative analysis was carried out using data from the 2018 survey. Results: Among the 97 surveys distributed in 2018, 44 respondents participated; from this group, 38 individuals contributed a total of 200 free-text responses. Facilitators (240 comments) outnumbered barriers (65 comments). Key facilitators were accessible and timely care, professional development, confidence and positive outcome beliefs. Barriers included communication, information handover, credibility, relationships and skill gaps. Optometrists actively engaged in the programme in 2023 reported heightened satisfaction with their involvement, increased confidence and greater engagement in paediatric eyecare delivery. However, challenges in clinical information transfer persist. Conclusion: The interprofessional collaborative model of paediatric eyecare has contributed efficiencies within the health system by building paediatric care capacity in the community, fostering professional credibility and promoting interdisciplinary trust. Insights gained should prove valuable for other paediatric eyecare services exploring hospital-to-community care models. © 2023 The Authors.

"Background: The menopausal transition involves multiple biological and psychosocial challenges that may render middle-aged women vulnerable to body image concerns. Objective: The aim of this study was to summarize evidence on the associations between menopause and body image perception in healthy middle-aged women. Design: This study is a systematic review of observational studies. Data sources and methods: Menopause-related exposure measures included menopausal stages, menopausal symptoms, and reproductive hormone levels during the menopausal transition. Studies investigating body image as an outcome, including through a positive (e.g. body self-esteem) or negative (e.g. body dissatisfaction) lens, were considered eligible. Articles published before March 2023 were identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase and underwent double screening, extraction, and quality assessment by two independent investigators. Characteristics and results were summarized using narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 820 non-duplicate records were identified, with 18 observational studies deemed eligible for inclusion after full-text screening. All studies investigating menopausal symptoms and body image (n = 6) found some significant association between them, with a higher frequency, intensity, or number of symptoms being associated with greater body image concern. Differences in body image perception between menopausal stages were inconsistent across studies (n = 12), while evidence of potential associations between reproductive hormones and body image was minimal (n = 2). Findings should be interpreted with caution as 17 of the included studies used a cross-sectional design, and not all studies adjusted their analyses for relevant confounders. Conclusion: Overall, menopausal symptoms showed relatively consistent associations with a more negative body image perception. Additional research is required to understand the potential role of menopausal stages and reproductive hormone levels in the body image perception of middle-aged women and to confirm the direction of reported associations.

"Text sentiment analysis, often termed as opinion mining, delves into quantifying individuals' opinions, evaluatio ns, attitudes, and emotions conveyed about entities. Sentiment a nalysis of text can be categorized into text-level, sentence-level, and aspect-level analyses. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (A BSA) represents a detailed sub-discipline within sentiment anal ysis, with its primary goal being to ascertain the sentiment pola rity of specific aspects. The research of pre-training neural mod el has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing tasks. In recent years, pre training model (PTM) has been applied in ABSA. Therefore, there has been a q uestion, which is whether PTMs contain sufficient syntactic info rmation for ABSA. In this paper, we explored the recent DeBE RTa model (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) to solve Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis problem. DeBE RTa is a kind of neural language model based on transformer, which uses self-supervised learning to pre-train on a large num ber of original text corpora. Based on the Local Context Focus (LCF) mechanism, by integrating DeBERTa model, we purpos e a multi-task learning model for aspect-based sentiment analys is. The experiments result on the most commonly used the lapto p and restaurant datasets of SemEval-2014 and the ACL twitte r dataset show that LCF mechanism with DeBERTa has signifi cant improvement. © 2023 IEEE."
"The development of the Internet makes online reviews tend to be multilingual. In the study of aspect sentiment analysis tasks, traditional monolingual methods is unable to fully extract the reviews sentiment information in multilingual situations. To solve the limitations of traditional monolingual sentiment analysis in multilingual situations, a ngram-based multilingual gated convolutional neural network model was proposed. The model divided the review text into the left context and the right context, and uses convolutional neural network to obtain ngram features of different size between the left and right contexts. After max pooling, the gating mechanism is used to realize the interaction between ngram features. Finally, the features extracted from the left context and the right context is used to detect aspect categories. In this paper, several experiments have been conducted for the proposed model. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model is significantly better than other comparison models, which can more effectively extract the emotional information of user reviews more effectively and improve the accuracy of aspect category detection. © 2023 SPIE."
"Text classification is a critical task in the field of natural language processing. While pre-trained language models like BERT have made significant strides in improving performance in this area, the distinctive dependency information that is present in text has not been fully exploited. Besides, BERT mostly captures phrase-level information in lower layers, which becomes progressively weaker with the increasing depth of layers. To address these limitations, our work focuses on enhancing text classification through the incorporation of Attention Matrices, particularly in the fine-tuning process of pre-trained models like BERT. Our approach, named AM-BERT, leverages learned dependency relationships as external knowledge to enhance the pre-trained model by generating attention matrices. In addition, we introduce a new learning strategy that enables the model to retain learned phrase-level structure information. Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in text classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that AM-BERT achieves stable performance improvements also in named entity recognition tasks. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Link prediction in Online Social Networks—OSNs—has been the focus of numerous studies in the machine learning community. A successful machine learning-based solution for this task needs to (i) leverage global and local properties of the graph structure surrounding links; (ii) leverage the content produced by OSN users; and (iii) allow their representations to change over time, as thousands of new links between users and new content like textual posts, comments, images and videos are created/uploaded every month. Current works have successfully leveraged the structural information but only a few have also taken into account the textual content and/or the dynamicity of network structure and node attributes. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on temporal graph neural networks to handle the challenges described above. To understand the impact of textual content on this task, we provide a novel pipeline to include textual information alongside the structural one with the usage of BERT language models, dense preprocessing layers, and an effective post-processing decoder. We conducted the evaluation on a novel dataset gathered from an emerging blockchain-based online social network, using a live-update setting that takes into account the evolving nature of data and models. The dataset serves as a useful testing ground for link prediction evaluation because it provides high-resolution temporal information on link creation and textual content, characteristics hard to find in current benchmark datasets. Our results show that temporal graph learning is a promising solution for dynamic link prediction with text. Indeed, combining textual features and dynamic Graph Neural Networks—GNNs—leads to the best performances over time. On average, the textual content can enhance the performance of a dynamic GNN by 3.1% and, as the collection of documents increases in size over time, help even models that do not consider the structural information of the network. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Introduction: Scientific articles serve as vital sources of biomedical information, but with the yearly growth in publication volume, processing such vast amounts of information has become increasingly challenging. This difficulty is particularly pronounced when it requires the expertise of highly qualified professionals. Our research focused on the domain-specific articles classification to determine whether they contain information about drug-induced liver injury (DILI). DILI is a clinically significant condition and one of the reasons for drug registration failures. The rapid and accurate identification of drugs that may cause such conditions can prevent side effects in millions of patients. Methods: Developing a text classification method can help regulators, such as the FDA, much faster at a massive scale identify facts of potential DILI of concrete drugs. In our study, we compared several text classification methodologies, including transformers, LSTMs, information theory, and statistics-based methods. We devised a simple and interpretable text classification method that is as fast as Naïve Bayes while delivering superior performance for topic-oriented text categorisation. Moreover, we revisited techniques and methodologies to handle the imbalance of the data. Results: Transformers achieve the best results in cases if the distribution of classes and semantics of test data matches the training set. But in cases of imbalanced data, simple statistical-information theory-based models can surpass complex transformers, bringing more interpretable results that are so important for the biomedical domain. As our results show, neural networks can achieve better results if they are pre-trained on domain-specific data, and the loss function was designed to reflect the class distribution. Discussion: Overall, transformers are powerful architecture, however, in certain cases, such as topic classification, its usage can be redundant and simple statistical approaches can achieve compatible results while being much faster and explainable. However, we see potential in combining results from both worlds. Development of new neural network architectures, loss functions and training procedures that bring stability to unbalanced data is a promising topic of development.

"In this paper I show how Gunther Kress, throughout his work, struggled with the contradictory poles of intellectual attraction that lead many other thinkers to firmly anchor themselves to fixed positions and safeguard themselves from doubt. I will focus on two issues, the tension between social determination and individual agency, and the tension between 'critique' and 'design'. In his early work, Kress spoke of the individual as socially determined and of linguistic competence as a product of the social structure. Later he began to emphasize individual agency (and the agency of 'communities') rather than the power of ideologies and institutions. But the tension between the two continued to be felt throughout his work. Secondly, though Kress was one of the originators of critical discourse analysis, he later distanced himself from it, arguing that critique looks backwards and focuses on power and convention, while design looks forward and focuses on empowerment and innovation. But here too, the issue was never finally settled, and Kress recognized that critique and design are interdependent. Finally, I will describe Kress's 'exploratory' approach to semiotics in which an open attitude to data, dialogue, and the interdependence of text analysis and theory-formation play a fundamental role.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2023."
"Introduction: This study examines the associations between time series, termed “coherency,” using spectral analysis. Coherence squared, analogous to the squared correlation coefficient, serves as a metric to quantify the degree of interdependence and co-evolution of individual nodes. Methods: We utilized spectral analysis to compute coherence squared, unveiling relationships and co-evolution patterns among individual nodes. The resultant matrix of these relationships was subjected to network analysis. Results: By conducting a case study analyzing tweets associated with the co-hashtags #StopAsianHate and #BlackLivesMatter, we present a novel approach utilizing coherency network analysis to investigate the dynamics of social media text. Frequency domain analysis aided in calculating coherence squared, effectively illustrating the relationships and co-evolution of individual nodes. Furthermore, an analysis of the phase spectrum's slope facilitated the determination of time lag and potential causality direction between highly co-evolved node pairs. Discussion: Our findings underline the potential of coherency network analysis in comprehending the intricate dynamics of social media text. This approach offers valuable insights into how topics, sentiments, or movements manifest and evolve within the digital realm. Future research should explore diverse datasets and domains to broaden our understanding of this novel analytical technique. Copyright © 2023 Jiang and Xu."
"Current research in cross-modal retrieval has primarily focused on aligning the global features of videos and sentences. However, video conveys a much more comprehensive range of information than text. Thus, text-video matching should focus on the similarities between frames containing critical information and text semantics. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional feature aggregation model based on the attention mechanism. It includes two innovative modules: (1) A cross-modal attentional feature aggregation module, which uses the semantic text features as conditional projections to extract the most relevant features from the video frames. It aggregates these frame features to form global video features. (2) A global-local similarity calculation module calculates similarities at two granularities (video-sentence and frame-word features) to consider both the topic and detail features in the text-video matching process. Our experiments on the four widely used MSR-VTT, LSMDC, MSVD and DiDeMo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the cross-modal attention aggregation approach can effectively capture the primary semantic information of the video. At the same time, the global-local similarity calculation model can accurately match text and video based on topic and detail features. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."
"Spatial keyword query is a classical query processing mode for spatio-textual data, which aims to provide users the spatio-textual objects with the highest spatial proximity and textual similarity to the given query. However, the top-k result objects obtained by using the spatial keyword query mode are often similar to each other, while users hope that the system can pick top-k typicality results from the candidate query results in order to make users understand the representative features of the candidate result set. To deal with the problem of typicality analysis and typical object selection of spatio-textual data query results, a typicality evaluation and top-k approximate selection approach is proposed. First, the approach calculates the synthetic distances on dimensions of geographic location, textual semantics, and numeric attributes between all spatio-textual objects. And then, a hybrid index structure that can simultaneously support the location, text, and numeric multi-dimension matching is presented in order to expeditiously obtain the candidate query results. According to the synthetic distances between spatio-textual objects, a Gaussian kernel probability density estimation-based method for measuring the typicality of query results is proposed. To facilitate the query result analysis and top-k typical object selection, the Tournament strategy-based and local neighborhood-based top-k typical object approximate selection algorithms are presented, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the text semantic relevancy measuring method for spatio-textual objects is accurate and reasonable, and the local neighborhood-based top-k typicality result approximate selection algorithm achieved both the low error rate and high execution efficiency.

"While the COVID-19 pandemic morphs into less malignant forms, the virus has spawned a series of poorly understood, post-infection symptoms with staggering ramifications, i. e., long COVID (LC). This bibliometric study profiles the rapidly growing LC research domain [5,243 articles from PubMed and Web of Science (WoS)] to make its knowledge content more accessible. The article addresses What? Where? Who? and When? questions. A 13-topic Concept Grid presents bottom-up topic clusters. We break out those topics with other data fields, including disciplinary concentrations, topical details, and information on research “players” (countries, institutions, and authors) engaging in those topics. We provide access to results via a Dashboard website. We find a strongly growing, multidisciplinary LC research domain. That domain appears tightly connected based on shared research knowledge. However, we also observe notable concentrations of research activity in different disciplines. Data trends over 3 years of LC research suggest heightened attention to psychological and neurodegenerative symptoms, fatigue, and pulmonary involvement.

"Sarcasm classification has gained popularity among researchers due to its complexity and implicit form of context representation. The most challenging aspect of sarcasm identification is to understand the exact context behind the statement. Therefore, a context-based model helps solve this critical task in the research domain. The importance of sarcasm detection and classification is primarily helpful for society to avoid misinterpreting statements or reviews that could affect one’s mental condition and perception. Unfortunately, to increase the retention level of audience toward media news, often the media incorporate sarcasm in their news headlines. However, people find it difficult to detect sarcasm in news headlines, resulting in them having a false impression of the news and spreading it to their surroundings. Therefore, it has become a significant concern among the society to develop a sense of understanding of the hidden context behind the statement before making any type of impression and judgment. In this paper, we have focused on this problem statement and developed a novel technique called an Attention-based deep network model using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) i.e., ADN-BERT to classify news headlines into sarcastic and non-sarcastic categories. The News Headlines dataset is collected from Kaggle, and we have incorporated text augmentation to increase the size of the dataset to yield better results and accuracy. The evaluation metrics used in our study include accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. Our proposed model (ADN-BERT) has outperformed the recent state-of-the-art techniques with 94.1% accuracy, 95.2% recall, 94.5% precision, and 94.8% F1-score.Please check and approve the edits made in the chapter title and running title.Edited.

"This paper presents an analysis of the pragmatic marker eh, which is typical of spoken discourse, in written online discourse from nine varieties of English using the Corpus of Global Web-based English. The analysis focuses on sentence-final eh and considers variation in terms of variety, punctuation, text type, and function. This paper also includes a variationist analysis of eh in contrast to huh. Although there are cross-variety differences, eh is used across all nine varieties in similar ways. Eh is mostly combined with a question mark, it is more frequent in blogs than in general websites, and emphatic functions dominate over narrative and interrogative uses. A qualitative analysis of the indexicalities demonstrates that eh mainly signals orality and informality in online writing but also has specific local meanings. The variationist analysis shows that eh is preferred over huh in the Canadian and New Zealand components. This preference is even more pronounced for the British and Philippine components. In contrast, huh dominates in the US component. These results show that eh is well integrated into online writing and can be characterized as a translocal pragmatic marker as it is used globally but has developed local characteristics. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"SME development requires digital transformation in order to create inclusive growth. In light of the scarcity of studies on digital transformation in the context of SME development, this study evaluates available research on the subject using four levels of analysis. The primary goal of this research was to learn about the various determinants of digital transformation. A four-level unit analysis was carried out. A systematic literature study was used to analyze in depth the extant body of literature on various levels of topics linked to unit analysis. Scopus Preview literature sources from 2018 to 2022 were examined using typological agenda unit context, unit analysis, and digital transformation research techniques. The findings of the current study underline the scarcity of comprehensive research studies on digital transfor-mation, particularly those with mixed-method research methodologies, from emerging and developing countries. It is concluded that more studies on SME digital transformation must be conducted across all analytical units. It is therefore proposed studies be conducted in the con-text of four levels of intervention—individual, organization, ecosystem, and sociocultural—to support DT. © (2023), (Assumption University).

"Many existing image and text sentiment analysis methods only consider the interaction between image and text modalities, while ignoring the inconsistency and correlation of image and text data, to address this issue, an image and text aspect level multimodal sentiment analysis model using transformer and multi-layer attention interaction is proposed. Firstly, ResNet50 is used to extract image features, and RoBERTa-BiLSTM is used to extract text and aspect level features. Then, through the aspect direct interaction mechanism and deep attention interaction mechanism, multi-level fusion of aspect information and graphic information is carried out to remove text and images unrelated to the given aspect. The emotional representations of text data, image data, and aspect type sentiments are concatenated, fused, and fully connected. Finally, the designed sentiment classifier is used to achieve sentiment analysis in terms of images and texts. This effectively has improved the performance of sentiment discrimination in terms of graphics and text. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved."
"Easy access to social media platforms and effortless profile creation have enabled users to create online profiles in large numbers. Apart from general interaction, user profiles can be created to spread fake news and target individuals, organizations, and communities by bullying, trolling, and spreading hate content. Identifying these suspicious profiles is one of the crucial research issues in online social media. Most research works in this domain focus on a single attribute, like either profile features or post content, thereby proposing unimodal models capable of processing numeric data or text. This paper presents a multimodal approach to identifying suspicious user profiles. The multimodal features in our experiments are extracted from profiles, posts, and their engagement. The baseline experiments and comparison with unimodal approaches show the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal model. The proposed MSPIS framework gives high accuracy of 93.6% in detecting suspicious users by using rich multimodal features to assess user credibility. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Patient safety is the moral and ethical responsibility of healthcare professionals, representing a constantly evolving field in industrialized countries whose key factors are sustainability, training and prevention. Clinical risk management is primarily concerned with systems issues, but people are of paramount importance to effective teamwork and leadership. Hospitals have recently been urged to adopt the methods of high-fidelity organizations to identify and change ineffective practice patterns: recognizing that little things that go wrong are early warning signs of trouble, near miss and errors become information about the health of systems and learn from them. Italian Cardiology will have to assume clinical risk as a common practice, through a rigorous examination of the causes of adverse events, staff training, sharing of validated adverse event analysis tools, identification of corrective actions and definition of shared procedures, the systematic control of the adoption of the planned interventions, the evaluation of the results of the measures implemented by applying stringency and scientific method in this area. The text tries to explain, in a pragmatic way, the main problems that hinder the diffusion of the culture of safety in Italian hospitals and in cardiology by proposing solutions. © 2023 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore."
"Sentiment analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing, has garnered a great deal of attention within the research community. To date, numerous sentiment analysis approaches have been adopted and developed by researchers to suit a variety of application scenarios. This consistent adaptation has allowed for the optimal extraction of the authors emotional intent within text. A contributing factor to the growth in application scenarios is the mass adoption of social media platforms and the bondless topics of discussion they hold. For government, organizations and other miscellaneous parties, these opinions hold vital insight into public mindset, welfare, and intent. Successful utilization of these insights could lead to better methods of addressing said public, and in turn, could improve the overall state of public well-being. In this study, a framework using a hybrid sentiment analysis approach was developed. Various amalgamations were created – consisting of a simplified version of the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) lexicon and multiple instances of classical machine learning algorithms. In this study, a total of 67,585 public opinion-oriented Tweets created in 2020 applicable to the South African (ZA) domain were analyzed. The developed hybrid sentiment analysis approaches were compared against one another using well known performance metrics. The results concluded that the hybrid approach of the simplified VADER lexicon and the Medium Gaussian Support Vector Machine (MGSVM) algorithm outperformed the other seven hybrid algorithms. The Twitter dataset utilized serves to demonstrate model capability, specifically within the ZA context. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization). All Rights Reserved."
"For online social media, automatically identifying abusive language is a challenging but essential task. In recent years, finding abusive language in user-generated internet content has gained substantial attention. Our analysis focuses on human rights, including the development of fresh methods for identifying and defending the freedom of speech. In this paper, we consider strategies for distinguishing defamatory text from common profanity while detecting it. We have used the benchmark dataset of the Hate Speech Twitter Corpus, which contains 136,052 total tweets. Furthermore, this research uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for the method of classifying hate speech and abusive language. The final accuracy is ~82%. The technique revolves around including an extension that will accept the website's content (mostly text) as input, assess the contents for abusive purposes using specially developed neural networks, and hide the unethical content from the user. In contrast to the traditional way of users reporting abusive content, our solution does not require any human involvement and thereby limits offensive language by automatically recognizing and blocking it. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"Most natural language models and tools are restricted to one language, typically English. For researchers in the behavioral sciences investigating languages other than English, and for those researchers who would like to make cross-linguistic comparisons, hardly any computational linguistic tools exist, particularly none for those researchers who lack deep computational linguistic knowledge or programming skills. Yet, for interdisciplinary researchers in a variety of fields, ranging from psycholinguistics, social psychology, cognitive psychology, education, to literary studies, there certainly is a need for such a cross-linguistic tool. In the current paper, we present Lingualyzer (https://lingualyzer.com), an easily accessible tool that analyzes text at three different text levels (sentence, paragraph, document), which includes 351 multidimensional linguistic measures that are available in 41 different languages. This paper gives an overview of Lingualyzer, categorizes its hundreds of measures, demonstrates how it distinguishes itself from other text quantification tools, explains how it can be used, and provides validations. Lingualyzer is freely accessible for scientific purposes using an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"This text describes a study and its findings that utilized the “GHSZ_VNIIO” robot program to determine the thickness of the Gas Hydrate Stability Zone (GHSZ) in the Sea of Okhotsk.

"Currently, the online data contains rich user emotional information and public opinion information. These data can provide massive support for network public opinion monitoring and analysis. However, there are two problems in the network public opinion analysis of the online data. On the one hand, a vast amount of online data with discursiveness and concealment are processed in the cloud platforms, which consumes a long time. On the other hand, the massive online public opinion data is disperse and hidden, resulting in the dependence on manual screening for the analysis of public opinion. Therefore, it is still an important challenge to study the efficient and low-latency extraction of valuable information from network public opinion. In this paper, we proposed a fog computing based framework using the technologies of intelligent semantic recognition and data mining for the analysis of network public opinion. Firstly, we build a fog computing architecture to collect the text data of network public opinion. Then, an efficient network public opinion model is constructed by intelligence semantic recognition. Finally, we achieve the function of public opinion analysis and early warning. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper achieves better performance against some existing methods. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Peer Recovery Support Services (PRSS) have the potential to be an economically valuable intervention. To investigate this potential, we conducted a scoping review to summarize existing research on the economic impact of PRSS. We searched relevant electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and grey literature between January 2000 and February 2023 that examined an economic outcome related to PRSS. Following a comprehensive search, screening, and full-text evaluation, eight articles were selected for review. The majority of the studies we identified focused on healthcare cost-avoidance. Some studies supported PRSS as a method of avoiding costly medical services, while others had mixed results. Our scoping review revealed limited studies addressing cost savings associated with PRSS and further research on the economic impact of PRSS is warranted. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"Hubert Treiber has established himself as one of the world's leading scholars of Weber, in particular of his Sociology of Law. Especially, Treiber defends Weber's decisive contribution to legal pluralism, comparable to Eugen Ehrlich's, although from a quite different perspective. Indeed, it is not possible to analyse Weber's distinction between state and non-state law (a central distinction for legal pluralism) without taking into consideration what he means, sociologically, by ""law""on the one hand and by ""the state""on the other. Weber's ideal typical construction of social relations under the category ""law""requires an Archimedean point, which is the formal rationality of law, closely associated, at the end of an historical development, with the efforts of legal abstraction and systematisation by the proponents of Pandectism in modern Germany. In the following text, linked to some of Treiber's major works, the author addresses first Weber's analysis of the rationalities of law, and then deals with the question of the plurality of law, as these two aspects are closely intertwined. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2023."
"Candidate screening is the most costly step of the recruitment process. In order to eliminate a large number of candidates applying for a position, resumes are filtered based on features such as graduation department, technical skills, and experience. Within the scope of algorithmic recruitment, there are many studies on the automation of the recruitment process using semantic and data-based approaches. In this study, a natural language processing-based screening algorithm that automatically calculates candidates' suitability for a job posting using different categories is proposed. The proposed method generates a metric for each candidate that indicates their eligibility for the job post they applied for and ranks the candidates by using structured data. BERT based named entity recognition and stochastic gradient based domain classifier were used for the analysis of resume and job posting data. Semantic and fuzzy approaches were used together for the calculation of the similarity metric. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using manually annotated resume and job posting datasets that are filtered to include only software development categories. © 2023 IEEE."
"Brazil’s justice system faces grave case backlogs stemming from surging caseloads. This research explores automated text classification to expedite legal document analysis. Supervised machine learning approaches leveraging BERT embeddings fine-tuned on Brazilian legal text were evaluated using a 30,000 document dataset encompassing ten motion types from the Rio Grande do Norte Court of Justice. Documents were encoded into semantic representations via a BERT model adapted to local jurisprudence. The resulting optimized embeddings were used to train and benchmark models including KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, neural networks, CNNs, and deep learning architectures. Despite BERT’s state-of-the-art capabilities, TF-IDF outperformed neural techniques across considered metrics. High similarity between certain classes was hypothesized to hinder BERT’s contextual embedding. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Bayesian belief network is an effective and practical approach that is widely acceptable for real-time series prediction and decision making. However, its computational efforts and complexity increased exponentially with increased number of states. Hence, this research paper a proposed approach inspired by context-based persuasion analysis of sentiment analysis and its impact on the propagation of false information is designed. As social media text consist of unwanted information and needs to be addressed including effective polarity prediction of a sentimentwise ambiguous word in generic contexts. Therefore, in proposed approach persuasion-based strategy based on social media crowd is considered for analyzing the impact of sentimental contextual polarity in social media including pre-processing. For analyzing the polarity of sentiment, Bayesian belief network is used, whereas Turbo Parser is implemented for visual representation of diverse feature class and spontaneous hold of the relationships between features. Furthermore, to analyze the lexicons dependency on each word in terms of context, a tree-based dependency parser representation is used to count the dependency score. Features associated with sentimental words are extracted using Penn tree bank for sentiment polarity disambiguation. Therefore, a graphical model known as Bayesian network learning is opted to design a proposed approach which take care the dependency among various lexicons. Various predictors, namely, (1) pre-processing and subjectivity normalization, (2) computation of threshold and persuasion factor, and (3) extraction of sentiments from dependency parsing from the retrieved text are introduced. The findings of this study indicate that it is most important to compute the local and global context of various sentimental words to analyze the polarity of text. Furthermore, we have tested our proposed method with a standard data set and a real case study is also implemented based on COVID-19, Olympics-2020 and Russia–Ukraine war for the feasibility analysis of the proposed approach. The findings of this study imply a complex and context-dependent mechanism behind the sentiment analysis which shed lights on the efforts for resolving contextual polarity disambiguation in social media. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence and Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."
"Speeches are often construed to exert one’s power while projecting a political intent towards the audience. This research examines how power is reflected in speeches by Shinzō Abe, a former Prime Minister of Japan, through the categorisation of speech acts. The speeches were delivered in many of his press conferences during the Covid-19 pandemic. The research employed a quantitative approach, and the analysis largely drew on Searle's classification of speech acts to identify and categorise Mr Abe’s expressions of power. Data for this study focused on various formal press briefings, interviews, or other communicative exchanges he conducted in his role as a prime minister. Eight texts were selected for the analysis, and they were collected from the website of the Japanese Prime Minister's Secretariat office from February to May 2020. Findings from the analysis indicated that the prime minister mostly utilised performative verb utterance directions, such as informing (66%), asking (78%), promising (90%), thanking (54%), and deciding (76%), in a form of polite and respectful language, Keigo, to demonstrate reverence towards diplomatic entities. In addition, he frequently highlighted statistical data regarding the circumstances and the prevailing factors of the pandemic that led to a regime of truth and knowledge about Covid-19 in Japan. The findings provided better understanding of Shinzō Abe’s exercise of authority in managing the variability of Covid-19 incidences in Japan, as reflected in the movement of relations with the society and with those diplomatic entities. This suggests that Shinzo Abe’s speeches during the pandemic have a potential pathway that world leaders, linguists or students can traverse and inquire into to ensure community resilience to counteract the fragility caused by a pandemic. © (2023), (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia).

"This work summarizes some considerations related to the process of translation, analysis and commentary on chapter XII of the second volume of the book Exploration of the Valley of The Amazon, written by United States Navy Lieutenant Lardner Arthur Gibbon Arthur, between 1851 and 1852. The historical and political scenarios for the Amazon of that period are also presented and contextualized, to be able to understand more closely the conditions of possibility for the journeys, the compiled reports and opinions of the expeditionary to have taken place as they are known today. At the end of the translation of the chapter, rich in details about the descent from Bolivia to Brazil (especially along the Madeira River), we made 18 notes, in which we sought to cover economic, social and political life aspects of the population in region. We consulted the original text in different editions, in order to present a text in English and in Portuguese as accurate as possible, paying special attention to the units of measurement used at the time. We hope that the bilingual edition of this chapter will contribute to a greater knowledge of the neglected second volume of this exceptional book and of great value for the history of the Brazilian Amazon. © 2023.

"Deep learning algorithms have achieved remarkable accuracy in various domains such as image classification, face recognition, sentiment analysis, text classification, healthcare, and self-driving vehicles. However, their complex and opaque structures often hinder their adoption in mission-critical applications. The lack of interpretability in these models raises concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness. To address this challenge, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have emerged to provide human-comprehensible interpretations of AI outcomes. In this paper, we delve into the latest advancements in XAI techniques, focusing on their methodologies, algorithms, and the scope of interpretations they offer. Our study revolves around evaluating these algorithms based on the quality of explanations they generate, their limitations, and their practical applications. By critically assessing their strengths and weaknesses, we aim to shed light on the potential of XAI methods to bridge the gap between high-performance accuracy and interpretability in deep learning models. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the state-of-the-art XAI techniques, empowering researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions regarding the integration of explainability into their AI systems. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Objectives: This study explores the aesthetics of scenography in Arabic poetry, focusing on the dialectical scenography in Muhammad Al-Qaysi's works. It underscores the significance of integrating theatrical scenography elements for crafting and enhancing poetic images. Additionally, the study highlights the poet's adept use of scenography in his texts, examining his awareness of their importance in selected works. Methods: This study employs a semantical extrapolation approach, examining linguistic relations, visual signs, and symbolic signs. It systematically employs a deconstruction and construction approach to unravel meaning and connotation through language and technique. The study unfolds in three steps: describing the text as a network of embedded and intensive relations, exploring the signifier, and concluding with discourse analysis. Results: The study confirmed Al-Qaisi's endeavors to experiment with image, language, and rhythm in parallel with his awareness of the role of scenography in reproducing the structure and formation of his poetic text. Thus, it leads to the importance of the role of the active reader who can disassemble, interpret, and reproduce the text in each reading. In addition to that, the study concluded that arts converge in multiple relations which generate the fact that the core of deep art is the same in all arts. Conclusions: The study recommends studying the subject of scenography elements in modern poetry, its multiple representations, and its impact on the receiver and expectations. It urges researchers to explore new techniques that add novelty to the poetic text. © 2023 University of Jordan,Deanship of Scientific Research. All rights reserved."
"Intelligence agencies communicate uncertainty to decision-makers through verbal probability phrases that correspond to numerical ranges (i.e., probability lexicons) and ordinal levels of confidence. However, decision-makers may misinterpret the relationship between these concepts and form inappropriate interpretations of intelligence analysts' uncertainty. In two experiments, four ways of conveying second-order probability to decision-makers were compared: (a) probability and confidence phrases written in the text of a report, (b) the addition of a probability lexicon, (c) the addition of a probability lexicon that varied numerical ranges according to the level of confidence (i.e., revised lexicon), and (d) a probability phrase written in text followed by a numerical range that varied according to the level of confidence. The revised lexicon was expected to improve interpretations of second-order probability. The 275 participants in Experiment 1 and 796 participants in Experiment 2 provided numerical estimates corresponding to analytic judgments provided in descriptions about three overseas military operations and also indicated their support for approving or delaying the operations. The results demonstrated that providing the numerical range in the text of the report or providing a probability lexicon, improved interpretations of probability phrases above the verbal phrase-only condition, but not interpretations of confidence. Participants were unable to correctly interpret confidence with respect to the precision of their estimate intervals and their decisions about the operations. However, in Experiments 2 and 3 the effects on these variables of providing decision-makers with information about the source of the analyst's uncertainty were examined. In Experiment 3 (n = 510), providing this information improved correspondence between confidence level and approval of the operation. Recommendations are provided regarding additional methods of improving decision-makers' interpretation of second-order probability conveyed in intelligence reporting. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

"Objectives: This systematic review on generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures for dental image analysis provides a comprehensive overview to readers regarding current GAN trends in dental imagery and potential future applications. Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify studies involving GANs for dental image analysis. Eighteen full-text articles describing the applications of GANs in dental imagery were reviewed. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results: GANs were used for various imaging modalities, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. In dental imaging, GANs were utilized for tasks such as artifact reduction, denoising, and super-resolution, domain transfer, image generation for augmentation, outcome prediction, and identification. The generated images were incorporated into tasks such as landmark detection, object detection and classification. Because of heterogeneity among the studies, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. Most studies (72%) had a low risk of bias in all four domains. However, only three (17%) studies had a low risk of applicability concerns. Conclusions: This extensive analysis of GANs in dental imaging highlighted their broad application potential within the dental field. Future studies should address limitations related to the stability, repeatability, and overall interpretability of GAN architectures. By overcoming these challenges, the applicability of GANs in dentistry can be enhanced, ultimately benefiting the dental field in its use of GANs and artificial intelligence. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology."
"This article discusses the sequential devices which structure lyric poems. The sequentiality of poems is usually given little systematic attention to in poetry analysis. The main focus tends to be on speaker, imagery, theme and prosody. But a central aspect of the meaning of any poem is the manner in which the progression of the poetic utterance is organised. One such device, widely used in traditional and contemporary poetry, is the schema of the narrative. This article briefly sketches a theoretical approach to the descrip-tion of the sequential extension of poetic texts and applies it to examples from the work of two prominent contemporary English poets, Simon Armitage, the present poet laureate, and Glyn Maxwell. © 2023, University of Warsaw.

"Stock movement prediction is of paramount importance in financial markets, informing sound investment strategies. However, traditional numerical analysis often falls short due to market volatility and the inherent challenge of modeling dynamic change. We propose a Dynamic Event and Sentiment Interaction Graph Attention Network (DESIGN) method integrating numerical characteristics, news and comment text, with the added dimension of an event graph tracking the chain of events from news text. The method follows a multi-step approach for stock movement prediction, it starts by classifying the news text and then performs reasoning through the event graph to obtain event-inference-based indicators. These indicators are then fused with the ones derived from the raw numerical data, resulting in evolution features. Then, the method classifies the sentiment of comment text and dynamically constructs a stock relationship graph based on this result. Finally, a graph neural network is employed for prediction. Extensive experiments verify DESIGN's superior performance in stock movement prediction. © 2023 IEEE."
"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the requirements for accessible Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and AV services from a consumer perspective, focusing on people with disabilities (PwDs) and older adults. Methods: Two national surveys were conducted, capturing current transportation trends and AV priorities. Participants (n = 922) with disabilities and older adults were included in the analysis. Results: Transportation choices exhibited significant divergence based on the underlying causes of disabilities, showcasing distinct inclinations and impediments within each category. AV services, encompassing family conveyance and package delivery, proved integral, but their specific desirability fluctuated in accordance with the nature of disabilities. Notably, medical appointments emerged as the foremost AV utilisation requirement, particularly pronounced among individuals with hearing impairments. Preferences for orchestrating AV rides and the preferred vehicle types displayed disparities linked to the various disability classifications. The employment of mobile applications, websites, and text messages were preferred mediums for arranging rides. Features such as automated route guidance and collision prevention garnered unanimous precedence among AV attributes. Key priorities, spanning wheelchair accessibility, user profiles, and seamless communication with AVs, were universally emphasised across all participant clusters. The study indicated a moderate comfort level with AV deployment, implying the potential for favourable reception within the population of PwDs and older adults. Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of considering diverse needs in accessible AV development of vehicle and infrastructure and policies. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

"Although Launaea procumbens (Roxb.) Amin is not currently used by pharmacists; it has great potential for future medicinal use. According to both Ayurvedic texts and modern research, the leaves of Launaea procumbens have galactagogue, diuretic, antifungal, anorexic, anti-arthritic, and hepatoprotective properties. In this communication, various sections of L. procumbens, a member of the Asteraceae (Compositae) family is characterized pharmacognostically. Extracts were tested qualitatively for various constituents, revealing the presence of lignans, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, tannins, steroids, and flavonoids. The leaves and stems were extracted using four different solvents: methanol, chloroform, distilled water, and petroleum ether, with methanol and chloroform extracts showing more significant results than petroleum ether and distilled water extract. These observations will aid in identifying and standardizing the drug in its crude form and distinguishing it from adulteration. This work aims to develop standardization parameters for L. procumbens leaves and stems by evaluating its pharmacognostics and conducting preliminary phytochemical screening. Additionally, GC-MS fingerprinting of the leaves revealed the presence of nine different chemical constituents, which could be useful for differentiating L. procumbens from other species of the genus Launaea in the herbal industry. © 2023 Visagaa Publishing House."
"Sentiment Analysis is gaining traction nowadays owing to its diversified applications, one of them being identifying people's mental health issues. Researchers have done great work decoding the actual meaning of human sentiments with the help of machine learning and NLP However, multilingual sentiment analysis and detection of depression from the online comments of a user is still demanding the attention of researchers worldwide. This study offers a novel hybrid recurrent neural network (RNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture for multilingual sentiment analysis to detect mental health issues. RNN captures sequential information, while Bi-LSTM captures bidirectional dependencies, improving performance. The algorithm is comprised of multiple steps. Tokenization and word embeddings are used to preprocess the dataset. Splitting the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets, sentiment labels are applied to each text sample and encoded numerically. The hybrid RNN and Bi-LSTM model captures sentiment patterns well. The RNN component evaluates sequential information, while the Bi-LSTM component collects forward and backward dependencies to improve contextual knowledge. To train the model, back propagation and gradient descent minimize a loss function like cross-entropy loss.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Rare but serious thrombotic incidents in relation to thrombocytopenia, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), have been observed since the vaccine rollout, particularly among replication-defective adenoviral vector-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine recipients. Herein, we comprehensively reviewed and summarized reported studies of VITT following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination to determine its prevalence, clinical characteristics, as well as its management. A literature search up to October 1, 2021 using PubMed and SCOPUS identified a combined total of 720 articles. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline, after screening the titles and abstracts based on the eligibility criteria, the remaining 47 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 29 studies were in-cluded. Findings revealed that VITT cases are strongly related to viral vector-based vaccines, which are the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (95%) and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (4%), with much rarer reports involving messenger RNA-based vaccines such as the Moderna CO-VID-19 vaccine (0.2%) and the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (0.2%). The most severe manifestation of VITT is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with 317 cases (70.4%) and the earliest primary symptom in the majority of cases is headache. Intravenous immunoglobulin and non-heparin anticoagulant are the main therapeutic options for managing immune responses and throm-bosis, respectively. As there is emerging knowledge on and refinement of the published guide-lines regarding VITT, this review may assist the medical communities in early VITT recognition, understanding the clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria as well as its management, of-fering a window of opportunity to VITT patients. Further larger sample size trials could further elucidate the link and safety profile. © Korean Vaccine Society."
"The present study aims to explore the perceptions and usage of Augmented Reality (AR) technology among media students in Palestinian universities. A quantitative approach was adopted, and data was gathered from a web-based survey of 237 media students. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was utilized to gauge participants' perceptions of AR, and descriptive statistics were used for analysis. The findings reveal a generally positive perception of AR as a beneficial tool for skill enhancement, with mean scores ranging from 3.70 to 4.04 indicating strong agreement. The study also found moderate to high AR usage among participants, particularly for translating texts using Google Translate, but noted that usage patterns were more individual-oriented. Additionally, 91.1% of respondents attributed the COVID-19 pandemic to increased technology usage in higher education. The novelty of this study lies in providing insights into the perception and application of AR in higher education within the Palestinian context, an under-researched area. The study sheds light on the potential for integrating AR more formally into curricula, which could foster a more engaging and immersive educational experience. However, it also highlights the need to address barriers such as lack of technical support and possible discomfort with technology. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy."
"Multi Document Summarization (MDS) is a technique for extracting succinct summaries from groups of related documents. The usage of MDS in the e-learning context is more appealing for providing summaries for learning materials, which helps students and teachers to focus on key concepts of the learning materials. In a learning material, availability of non-textual document-elements such as figures/diagrams, plots, graphs, tables and algorithms can be seen widely, but keeping such document-elements in the summary is not possible as they are non-textual. This proposed work incorporates the text summarization approach with document-elements augmentation to the summary to provide a detailed coverage of information without exceeding the summary length constraint. The key information in the source text is identified by important phrase features and sentence features, and the summaries are generated by selecting important sentences using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework while reducing the redundancy using pre-trained sentence vectors. The relationships between the summary and document-elements are identified through document-element snippet extraction and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering approach. Experimental results of the proposed summary extraction and augmentation on educational dataset (EduSumm) show better performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Online job search through websites has been a remarkably advantageous tool for both job seekers and employers, effectively serving their needs for numerous years. The job-resume matching system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of resumes and job descriptions. In this study, we used AI models to analyze resumes and rank each resume based on its similarity to the job description. This proposed framework uses optical character recognition and object recognition models to detect text and sections from resumes. Afterward, the text preprocessing step is applied. The preprocessed section is classified with the BERT model. The section of resumes classified into 5 different categories (education, experience, skills, personal, and language) are sent to the information extraction module. By using the named entity recognition method, the module identifies 8 different categories in the text (title, degree, major, skill, language, city, country, and date). Based on extracted sections and named entities similarity between the job description and resume is calculated using cosine similarity. Each section's similarity score is calculated independently. This allows users to assign each section a weight based on the importance for the total score. Finally, in the developed web application, these weights are loaded into the system and resumes are compared with job applications to be sorted. The proposed resume matching framework accurately extracts relevant information from resumes, displays the similarity results of the candidates by ranking and sorting, and helps recruiters or managers to select the best-scored candidates. © 2023 IEEE."
"The IoT and AI are transforming social connections and communication. The article investigates how this symbiotic relationship impacts Twitter sentiment. Using the Twitter Sentiment Dataset,""this study analyzes how IoT and AI are changing linked experiences. Analyzing Twitter sentiment on this historic merger shows positive and negative sentiments. Social media allows people to express their thoughts and feelings. This evolving digital environment reflects society and reveals technology adoption sentiment. The merging of IoT with AI is a key technological achievement. Tweets provide a real-time snapshot of worldwide dialogues and reactions to understand public opinion on integration. This study examines the complicated sentiment landscape using the ""Twitter Sentiment Dataset,""which captures IoT and AI sentiments. Social media sentiment analysis has been used to study public reactions to technological advances. Several studies show that sentiment analysis can predict technological adoption, examine attitudes and concerns, uncover issues, influence legislation, and address ethical issues. Research also emphasizes sentiment polarization's enthusiasm-realism balance and how sentiment predicts technical impact. The research used the ""Twitter Sentiment Dataset,""with over 1.6 million tweets. Lowercase, punctuation, and stopwords were removed from the dataset. After that, NLP algorithms like sentiment analysis examined the text. The training and test sets were split, and TF- IDF vectorization retrieved features. This research tested sentiment analysis machine learning models (Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification, and Logistic Regression). Later, the best model was stored. The main measure of sentiment analysis model accuracy was accuracy. Logistic regression outperformed with 83% accuracy. The models accurately captured IoT and AI integration tweets, including joy and concerns. Sentiment analysis can disclose society's feelings, making IoT-AI integration promising. This study reveals that algorithms and human sentiment drive technology. Technology- emotion interactions affect public opinion, innovation ethics, and policy. The study shows that societal emotion is essential to technical advancement and lays the framework for human-valued IoT and AI.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Nowadays, tree-structured deep learning classifier models have been widely used in different applications to ensure effective feature representation and learning. Amongst, dimensional sentiment analysis is the most interactive research field, which intends to identify continuous numerical values in the valence-arousal (VA) space. To achieve this, a tree-structured regional convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (T-CNN-LSTM) model was developed, which predicts the VA ratings of the texts for sentiment analysis. In contrast, the effect of a low prediction rate and difficulty of feature learning in a small number of class samples was not analyzed. Hence, this manuscript proposes an adversarial T-CNN-LSTM (A-T-CNN-LSTM) model for predicting the VA to achieve more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This model develops a semantic-enabled frequency-aware generative adversarial network (SFGAN) to produce more adversarial samples using the generator network and decrease the spectral data loss of the discriminator. It embeds the frequency-aware categorizer (FAC) into the discriminator to determine the input veracity in the spatial and spectral domains. Besides, semantic restricted sampling is employed in SFGAN for synthesizing the image subject to a semantic mask. Further, the created samples are classified by the T-CNN-LSTM for predicting the VA scores of sentences. Finally, the experimental results exhibit that the A-T-CNN-LSTM on stanford sentiment Treebank (SST) and CIFAR-10 databases achieves 90.12% and 91% accuracy than the other tree-structured CNNs. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

"We aim to summarize the latest evidence on platelet-rich plasma (PRP) intracavernosal injections efficacy in men affected by primary organic erectile dysfunction (ED). We reviewed the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective and retrospective comparative studies evaluating PRP alone or in combination for ED treatment. A comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed for English language full-text articles or conference abstracts. A qualitative and quantitative data synthesis was provided. Overall, seven records were included: three RCTs evaluated PRP vs. placebo, one study separately tested PRP and low-intensity shock wave therapy (Li-SWT), three studies compared Li-SWT or low-intensity pulsed ultrasound alone with their combination with PRP. Of 641 included patients, 320 received PRP. Despite the heterogeneity among inclusion criteria, dose and protocol of PRP administration, and outcomes measured, most studies independently reported better sexual outcomes in patients who received PRP, without significant severe side effects. In meta-analysis, where only placebo-controlled studies were included, patients treated with PRP showed higher International Index of Erectile Function (erectile function domain) score compared to patients who received placebo: pooled mean difference (95% Confidence Interval) of 2.99 (1.86, 4.13) after 1 month (209 patients) vs. 2.85 (1.61, 4.09) after 3 months (204 patients) vs. 3.21 (1.82, 4.60) after 6 months (199 patients) of follow-up. In men affected by primary organic ED, PRP intracavernosal injections demonstrated an objective improvement or at least a tendency in erectile function recovery. Patient numbers, and the short-term follow-up may limit the generalizability of these observations. High quality, large-scale, and standardized controlled trials are needed before recommending its definitive use in clinical practice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"This study compares three different methods commonly employed for the determination and interpretation of the subject matter of large corpuses of textual data. The methods reviewed are: (1) topic modeling, (2) community or group detection, and (3) cluster analysis of semantic networks. Two different datasets related to health topics were gathered from Twitter posts to compare the methods. The first dataset includes 16,138 original tweets concerning HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) from April 3, 2019 to April 3, 2020. The second dataset is comprised of 12,613 tweets about childhood vaccination from July 1, 2018 to October 15, 2018. Our findings suggest that the separate “topics” suggested by semantic networks (community detection) and/or cluster analysis (Ward's method) are more clearly identified than the topic modeling results. Topic modeling produced more subjects, but these tended to overlap. This study offers a better understanding of how results may vary based on method to determine subject matter chosen.

"The purpose of the following article is to comment on the proposed translation of fragments of The Sea and the Jungle by Henry Major Tomlinson, published in 1912, as well as the proposed translation strategies. Tomlinson’s text was chosen because of its poetic nature, especially its use of figures of speech such as metaphor, alliteration, and hypotyposis. For the following commentary, we have chosen to present three fragments with representative examples of hypotyposis, the translations we have proposed, and a brief analysis of description as painting, unusual collocations, and sensory appeal, characteristics of the hypotyposis formation process employed by the author. © 2023, Esta obra utiliza uma licença Creative Commons CC BY: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0.

"With the development of information technology and big data, large amount of multimodal data with opinion biases has exploded. Compared to unimodal data, multimodal data can accurately identify users' emotional tendencies and enrich emotional attitudes from a variety of perspectives. To effectively identify the consistency of sentiment representations between image and text semantics, as well as the variability in the degree of contribution in sentiment analysis, an image-text fusion sentiment analysis method based on text attention is proposed. The method constructs attention-based models for extracting text and images' features, emphasizes the words containing sentiment information, and builds a sentiment classification model using multimodal feature fusion. Experimental results show fusion method proposed has achieved better performance in both accuracy and F1 values compared with baseline models. © 2023 SPIE."
"This study examines why people choose to participate in online and face-to-face craft groups and seeks to understand how the mode of participation impacts individual experience and meaning making. Data from eight semi-structured interviews, text analysis of 345 social media posts, and participant observation of four face-to-face craft group meet-ups are synthesized, resulting in identification of social, technical and expressive meanings that underpin motivation to participate in both online and physical groups. These three categories expand on previous research categorizing motivation and meanings related to physical craft groups, by considering the range of asynchronous making-related online activities. The processes associated with sharing and acquiring knowledge and skills in online and physical craft groups were compared, with online groups being considered more conducive to the sharing of explicit or ‘hard’ knowledge, and physical groups being more suited to the sharing of tacit or ‘soft’ knowledge. © 2023 Intellect Ltd."
"Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) provide a direct way for public safety officials to reach at-risk publics via text-based messages on their mobile devices. Although WEAs were introduced over a decade ago and can be either 90 or 360 characters in length, we currently do not know what these messages have contained. To address this gap, we quantify the contents of the last decade of WEA messages using the principles of effective warning message design. Specifically, we use quantitative content analysis to conduct a longitudinal assessment of 6080 WEAs sent by Alerting Authorities from 2012 to 2022. We code these messages according to the concepts in the Warning Response Model, which establishes that WEAs need to include information about the hazard, location, source, guidance, and time. Our results indicate that source and timing information are included at a much lower rate than location, hazard, and guidance information. Furthermore, only 8.5% of these messages are complete—or include all five pieces of WRM content. Complete WEA messages can minimise protective action delay while maximising message understanding, belief, and personalisation. We also find that 360-character WEAs are more likely to be complete than 90-character WEAs. Thus, those responsible for crafting WEAs should continue to take full advantage of the increased number of characters to write complete messages that warn populations at risk, rather than simply alert them to the existence of a hazard. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"—Online social media platforms have contributed sig-nificantly t o t he dissemination o fuser-generated information. Many studies have proposed various techniques to analyze publicly available short texts to automatically extract topics. The majority of these works have mainly focused on the competitive performance of the proposed approaches. In this paper, our main focus is on how to tackle this problem by incorporating two other important qualities: Transparency and Carbon Footprint. These two pillars are cornerstones to fulfill the emerging international demands and to adhere to the new regulations, such as “Right to Explanation” and “Green AI”. Based on these three qualities, this paper compares the most prominent algorithms in this field (specifically within the category of unsupervised-retrospective learning), such as: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factoriza-tion, and K-Means, as well as two most recent approaches, such as: BERTopic and Contextual Analysis. By using two different datasets, the methods were evaluated for Perfor-mance. On average, the results show that BERTopic is the best-performing approach overall in terms of Performance. However, Contextual Analysis achieves the best Performance in one of the two datasets used. When considering the three qualities together, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the Contextual Analysis method t owards a more transparent and greener approach for the topic detection task. © 2023, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

"This paper focuses on the intrinsic relation between language and identity in literature. Characters in all fictional worlds have their own language and way of speaking. Their linguistic features shape their identity and characterisation and help the reader identify all characters in a literary work. Hence, this project aims at analysing the resulting identity of fictional characters with a focus on linguistic variation and the use of language. The study has two main objectives: To analyse the male characters’ speech and its evolution in the novel, and to analyse the extent to which their translation may have an impact on the characters’ literary identity. In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, this paper analyses the language of the main male characters of the Victorian novel Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891) and its translations into Spanish. The male characters seem to function as opposition to the characterisation of the novel’s main character, Tess Durbeyfield. In addition, they use a very distinct language, which will contrast with the rest of the characters. Thus, this paper aims at verifying whether this contrast as well as their distinguishable characterisations are maintained in the target texts. As will be seen, translating distinct language is essential in fictional characteri-sation as well as in the reception of foreign literature, in this case, English literature in the Spanish context. © Transfer, 2023."
"Text classification also called (text categorization or text tagging) is a crucial and extensively used approach in Natural Language Processing (NLP), to predict unseen content documents into prearranged categories. In this paper, we evaluate the dataset construction and evaluation process as a component of text classification. To begin with, we produced a newly created dataset for Indian Origin Scientists for text classification, which was collected by applying focused crawling and web scraping techniques. We then demonstrate an extensive evaluation of numerous models on this recently constructed dataset. Our evaluations display that the Random forest model outperforms the rest of the supervised models. Our results produce a fine beginning for additional research in Indian Origin Scientists' classification of text. Investigational outcome with K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine for Indian-origin scientists produced much better performances for Random Forest when combined with SMOTE and K fold cross-validation techniques. We apply the Area under the ROC Curve to compute the effectiveness of the chosen models. Overall, the Random Forest classifier exhibited the best output along with 90% micro-average AUC. © 2023 International Academic Publishing House (IAPH). All Rights Reserved."
"The paper examines adjective-noun terms with the adjective telesni in the Slovenian kinesiological terminology and compares the frequency of their terminological use to their frequency in the general lexis of the web-used Slovenian. The most frequent terms composed of the premodifying adjective telesni and a noun have been collected from abstracts of two Slovenian journals in kinesiology that have been published in the last four years. The most frequent English equivalents of the terms containing the adjective telesni have been determined through the parallel comparison of the original and the translation of abstracts, which has allowed us to explore the terms’ synonyms.

"During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, China's population has been ageing rapidly. Protecting the rights of elderly readers can not only deal with the aging of the population actively but also meet the spiritual and cultural needs of the elderly. In order to understand the government policy's actuality of protecting the rights of elderly readers in China, this paper establishes a three-dimensional analysis framework of ""policy tools- elements of elderly readers' rights-policy participants"" from the perspective of policy tools. By using the content analysis method to analyze the 81 policy samples published from 2012 to 2022, this paper summarizes the policy characteristics of protecting the elderly readers' rights in China. Firstly, in the policy structures, the current policies that protect the rights of elderly readers in China are mainly guiding and planning policies, which provide the foundation and indicate the direction for protecting the elderly readers"" rights in details. Secondly, policy tools concerning the supply, environment, and demand are not balanced, and the combination and collocation of various policy tools are uneven, supply policy tools account for the largest proportion, meanwhile, and there is a large gap in the distribution of environmental policy tools and demand policy tools. Thirdly, in terms of elements of elderly readers' rights, there are obvious differences in the frequency of response to different rights of elderly readers, and the policies primarily focus on protecting the right of use for elderly readers, however, the protection of other elements of elderly readers rights is relatively weak. Finally, in terms of policy participants, the government is the dominant force at present and the situation that multi-subjects participate in the protecting of elderly readers' rights has not formed.Consequently, this paper puts forward the following suggestions: 1) build a ""1+N"" policy system to promote concerted efforts in protecting the rights of elderly readers; 2) strengthen the coordination of policy tools: 3) improve the overall level of policy guarantee and establish the all-round policy system of protection the elderly readers' rights; 4) stimulate the enthusiasm of multi-subjects and appeal them to participate in the protection of elderly readers' rights. 4 figs. 5 tabs. 25 refs. © 2023, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

"We present an extensive driver assistance system capable of executing two essential tasks. The first module is used in assisting the driver with road safety alerts (RSA); it scans the road environment and detects any significant entities including but not limited to vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights. Further, alerts are issued when the estimated physical distance from detected entities is less than a set threshold. For this module, we also propose the usage of a compute-accelerated Swin Transformer model and evaluate its efficacy against other state-of-the-art models by considering relevant metrics like inference time and mAP. The second module pertains to driver alertness detection (DAD) for identifying signs of fatigue. It scans the driver’s face and monitors a live video feed to ensure that the driver shows no signs of micro-sleep. When either module detects a behavioural anomaly, it will alert the driver with text-based messages and non-disruptive audio messages. We propose such a state-of-the-art safety system being integrated into the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS’s) seen in modern vehicles. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"This article investigates how French playwright Florian Zeller positions his writing with respect to realism in his play The Father (Le Père, 2012) and what his dramaturgy of porosity adds to the representation of dementia in contemporary theatre. Through an analysis of the text of The Father and its West End theatre production (2015), this article demonstrates the ways in which this play challenges the dominant perspective in theatre that depicts dementia from the perspective of the outsiders–i.e., those who do not have dementia. On stage, the perceived reality of persons living with dementia has often been portrayed as an illusion, in contrast to the ‘true’ reality perceived by neurotypical people. This article examines how Zeller’s dramaturgy of porosity, by making the audience see the reality from the perspective of the protagonist living with dementia, generates encounters with alternative ways of perceiving and relating to the world. While drawing on theoretical discussions on neurodivergent aesthetics, this paper argues that contemporary theatre can evoke divergent consciousnesses of persons with dementia by using dramaturgical and theatrical strategies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The fundamental aim of the research was to deepen knowledge of the influence of developing the wording of job offers on the number of candidates responding to them. It stems from the overarching aim consisting in improving human resource management (HRM) by knowledge management (KM) related to the job market and job seekers' reactions to information concerning competence requirements published in job offers. The specific objective was to answer two questions: are there words in job offers that increase the number of job seekers, and whether this number is dependent on the length of the wording of the selected module of an offer. Particular attention was paid to positive words. It was checked whether their number in relation to the number of all words in an offer matters. In order to answer the research questions, text processing methods such as tokenization and lemmatization were first used, followed by the analysis by means of such statistical methods as the chi-square test (χ^2) and the Mann-Whitney U test. The obtained research results allowed to illustrate job seekers’ preferences. It was noted that the length of an offer is also important. However, it was not possible to confirm the assumption that positive words increase the attractiveness of an offer. Despite the limitations of a little diversified database (candidates were dominated by young people with little work experience), the research brought new value to competence and human resource management. The research resulted in extending the scope of knowledge on the use of the analysis of job offers in the area of effective communication with candidates for work in organizations. © 2023 Academic Conferences Limited.

"Reginaldo Carvalho (Guarabira-PB, 1932 – João Pessoa-PB, 2013) composed soundtracks for theater and cinema, having participated in several productions with different groups in many Brazilian states. Based on previous studies (SILVA, 2017) and on the composer's catalog of works (CARVALHO, 1995), we have so far identified twenty-one compositions for dramaturgical shows performed between 1947 and 1974. The objective of this investigation is to analyze the soundtrack of Ladrão em noite de chuva, based on the text by Millôr Fernandes, highlighting its main structural elements and how the relation between music and image occurs in the filmic narrative. It is, effectively, the only work that we have found, until this moment, that the composer produced for the cinema, hence its importance. Thus, we seek to contribute to the expansion of studies in this field and, more specifically, to the work of Reginaldo Carvalho. The article is divided into two parts: one is dedicated to the description of the plot and the main aspects of the soundtrack; the second part involves the relation between text, music and image, based upon Magaldi (2004), Duarte (2006), McKee (2006), Brait (2008), among others. In this work, particularly, there is a strong influence of the experiences that the composer had in Paris, during his first season, between 1953 and 1956. At that time, through the contact with Paul Le Flem, Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Schaeffer, he participated in many artistic and cultural activities and embarked on the field of musical experimentalism. © 2023 National Association of Music Research and Postgraduates.

"Korean is the native and official language of Chinese-Korean people. Although the Chinese-Korean and the Korean in South Korea are the same language, there are differences in vocabulary, grammar, and other aspects due to cultural influences. Reasonable analysis and utilization of texts are of great significance for promoting the development of minority languages and enhancing ethnic unity. In this paper, we propose a few-shot Chinese-Korean text classification method (CKKP) based on pre-trained language models (PLMS) combined with knowledge base (KB) and prompt learning. In this work, Chinese-Korean news data are scraped from Yanbian Daily, and we clean and label the data to obtain a Chinese-Korean datasets. We focus on collecting external knowledge and integrating it into the utterance to form a prompt of knowledge to improve and stabilize the prompt. Specifically, we use the clustering algorithm to construct the label wordspace of the external knowledge base extended language. Then, before using the extended label word space for prediction, we use PLM itself to refine the extended label word space. Finally, a projection is constructed between the label space for prompt learning and the label word space. Extensive experiments on a Chinese-Korean news datasets collected from Yanbian Daily, Naver Korean, and Twitter Korean datasets which demonstrate the effectiveness of the knowledge prompt learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"Background: Speech features are essential components of psychiatric examinations, serving as important markers in the recognition and monitoring of mental illnesses. This study aims to develop a new clinical decision support system based on artificial intelligence, utilizing speech signals to distinguish between bipolar, depressive, anxiety and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Subjects and methods: A total of 79 patients, who were admitted to the psychiatry clinic between 2020-2021, including 15 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 24 with anxiety disorders, 25 with depressive disorders, and 15 with bipolar affective disorder, alongside with 25 healthy individuals were included in the study. The speech signal dataset was created by recording participants’ readings of two texts determined by the Russell emotion model. The number of speech samples was increased by using random sampling in speech signals. The sample audio signals were decomposed into time-frequency coeﬃcients using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). Feature extraction was performed using each coeﬃcient obtained from both Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCC) and Gammatone Cepstral Coeﬃcient (GTCC) methods. The disorder classification was carried out using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Results: The success rate of the developed model in distinguishing the disorders was 96.943%. While the kNN model exhibited the highest performance in diagnosing bipolar disorder, it performed the least effectively in detecting depressive disorders. Whereas, the SVM model demonstrated close and high performance in detecting anxiety and psychosis, but its performance was low in identifying bipolar disorder. The findings support the utilization of speech analysis for distinguishing major psychiatric disorders. In this regard, the future development of artificial intelligence-based systems has the potential to enhance the psychiatric diagnosis process. © Medicinska naklada – Zagreb, Croatia."
"In this paper, we perform an exhaustive evaluation of different representations to address the intent classification problem in a Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) setup. We benchmark three types of systems to perform the SLU intent detection task: 1) text-based, 2) lattice-based, and a novel 3) multimodal approach. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of what could be the achievable performance of different state-of-the-art SLU systems under different circumstances, e.g., automatically- vs. manually-generated transcripts. We evaluate the systems on the publicly available SLURP spoken language resource corpus. Our results indicate that using richer forms of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs, namely word-consensus-networks, allows the SLU system to improve in comparison to the 1-best setup (5.5% relative improvement). However, crossmodal approaches, i.e., learning from acoustic and text embeddings, obtains performance similar to the oracle setup, a relative improvement of 17.8% over the 1-best configuration, being a recommended alternative to overcome the limitations of working with automatically generated transcripts. © 2023 IEEE."
"This paper presents an efficient method for categorizing the sentiments of Internet users, with a focus on social media users, using a confidence interval to estimate the reliability of sentiment predictions. The classification is based on the sentiments expressed in their posts, which are divided into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The paper presents an analysis table that analyzes sentiments and opinions about online product brands. The process includes two steps: 1) analyzing sentiments from text data using machine learning techniques, and 2) describing a five-step sentiment and opinion classification process that includes data collection, preprocessing, algorithm application, validation, and visualization. The proposed solution is implemented using Python, along with the scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, and Dash libraries, and leverages the use of confidence intervals to assess the accuracy and reliability of the sentiment analysis model. © 2023 The Authors.

"Social media has become an essential source of news for everyday users. However, the rise of fake news on social media has made it more difficult for users to trust the information on these platforms. Most research studies focus on fake news detection in the English language, and only a limited number of studies deal with fake news in resource-poor languages such as Urdu. This article proposes a globally weighted term selection approach named normalized effect size (NES) to select highly discriminative features for Urdu fake news classification. The proposed model is based on the traditional inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting measure. TF-IDF transforms the textual data into a weighted term-document matrix and is usually prone to the curse of dimensionality. Our novel statistical model filters the most discriminative terms to reduce the data’s dimensionality and improve classification accuracy. We compare the proposed approach with the seven well-known feature selection and ranking techniques, namely normalized difference measure (NDM), binormal separation (BNS), odds ratio (OR), GINI, distinguished feature selector (DFS), information gain (IG), and Chi square (Chi). Our ensemble-based approach achieves high performance on two benchmark datasets, BET and UFN, achieving an accuracy of 88% and 90%, respectively. © 2023 Wasim et al.

"This work focuses on modelling a speaker's accent that does not have a dedicated text-to-speech (TTS) frontend, including a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module. Prior work on modelling accents assumes a phonetic transcription is available for the target accent, which might not be the case for low-resource, regional accents. In our work, we propose an approach whereby we first augment the target accent data to sound like the donor voice via voice conversion, then train a multi-speaker multi-accent TTS model on the combination of recordings and synthetic data, to generate the donor's voice speaking in the target accent. Throughout the procedure, we use a TTS frontend developed for the same language but a different accent. We show qualitative and quantitative analysis where the proposed strategy achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other generative models. Our work demonstrates that low resource accents can be modelled with relatively little data and without developing an accent-specific TTS frontend. Audio samples of our model converting to multiple accents are available on our web page3 © 2023 IEEE."
"Education policies are typically anchored in official texts that provide a foundation for their enactment in schools. What are the implications of an invisible policy not anchored in any official text due to political motives? This study explores the enactment of an invisible education policy that regulates religious enclave schools. These schools’ curricula are the source of frequent conflict between states and religious enclave communities. The study draws on the case of the National Haredi Education (NHE) reform in Israel that enabled ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) private schools in Israel to affiliate with a new stream of public schools whose regulations were not anchored in any official text. The data comprised interviews with principals, teachers, and supervisors, as well as document analysis. The findings showed that the enactment of the NHE policy was primarily manifested in invisible changes, such as teacher professionalisation and pupil assessment. Curricular changes visible to the wider school community were enacted differently in different schools. Our findings also characterised the implications of the NHE policy’s invisibility. The lack of institutional recognition hindered the reform, but the autonomy of the implementing agents enabled them to promote changes within their purview and become policy entrepreneurs. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: This review focuses on studies about digital health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Digital health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly adopting gender-transformative approaches to address factors that derail women's access to maternal healthcare services. However, there remains a paucity of synthesized evidence on gender-transformative digital health programs for maternal healthcare and the corresponding research, program and policy implications. Therefore, this systematic review aims to synthesize evidence of approaches to transformative gender integration in digital health programs (specifically mHealth) for maternal health in sub-Saharan Africa. Method: The following key terms “mobile health”, “gender”, “maternal health”, “sub-Saharan Africa” were used to conduct electronic searches in the following databases: PsycInfo, EMBASE, Medline (OVID), CINAHL, and Global Health databases. The method and results are reported as consistent with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Data synthesis followed a convergent approach for mixed-method systematic review recommended by the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute). Results: Of the 394 studies retrieved from the databases, 11 were included in the review. Out of these, six studies were qualitative in nature, three were randomized control trials, and two were mixed-method studies. Findings show that gender transformative programs addressed one or more of the following categories: (1) gender norms/roles/relations, (2) women's specific needs, (3) causes of gender-based health inequities, (4) ways to transform harmful gender norms, (5) promoting gender equality, (6) progressive changes in power relationships between women and men. The most common mHealth delivery system was text messages via short message service on mobile phones. The majority of mHealth programs for maternal healthcare were focused on reducing unintended pregnancies through the promotion of contraceptive use. The most employed gender transformative approach was a focus on women's specific needs. Conclusion: Findings from gender transformative mHealth programs indicate positive results overall. Those reporting negative results indicated the need for a more explicit focus on gender in mHealth programs. Highlighting gender transformative approaches adds to discussions on how best to promote mHealth for maternal health through a gender transformative lens and provides evidence relevant to policy and research.

"In the absence of health law policies focused on perinatal depression (PND) in India, it has primarily remained a biomedical research matter instead of being understood from the human rights perspective. Also, the interplay between PND and the Indian justice delivery system remains unexplored. Hence, it is imperative to understand the medico-legal milieu of PND through the lens of judicial interface with the facet of PND. Most popular Indian electronic legal databases were used to identify the judgments pronounced by the Indian Courts where the PND quotient was involved. The text of the resultant judgments was individually read to evaluate if if the subject claim were affected by PND quotient to fit the inclusion criteria. Using the inductive and latent thematic approach, the different emergent themes from the subject claims of every single judgment were used for developing codes. Myriad themes emerged out of the analysis, which helped identify how PND vastly impacts the justice delivery system in varied types of cases in India. Obliviousness and lack of awareness in Indian judiciary regarding PND, and its consequences was largely observed. Human rights violations were discerned owing to absence of perinatal mental health (PMH) services. This policy gap, in turn, results in absence of data regarding women affected by PND and about administered treatment (if any) for managing PND, and reduced empathy by the law enforcement agencies. The resultant themes depict the urgent and multidimensional benefits of introducing policies for PMH services, which will help create awareness about the human rights dimension of PND amongst the law enforcement agencies including the Indian judiciary, and police. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."
"This must-read book combines carefully selected contributions to form a collective scholarly critique of existing research with international students, focusing on key critical and conceptual considerations for research where international students are participants or co-researchers. It pushes forward new agendas for the future of research with international students in global contexts, posing new sets of problems, provocations, and possibilities. Bringing together a range of interdisciplinary scholars, this book explores the many facets of research, which centres international students and their experiences. Each chapter concludes with practical reflection questions, suggestions for researchers, and examples in existing research to support research designs and aid in developing high-quality, critical research on this topic. Bringing fresh perspectives to the topic of research with international students, the book focuses on: Outlining current problems with existing research, including the ways that international students may be stereotyped, homogenised, Othered, or framed through deficit and colonial narratives (Re)-conceptualising key ideas that underpin research which are currently taken for granted Developing reflection points and practical guidance for new research designs which centre criticality and ethics Outlining ways that discourses and narratives about international students can be made more complex, particularly in reflection of their intersectional identities This key text is essential reading for researchers at all career stages to reflect on issues of power, inequality, and ethics, whilst developing understandings about critical choices in research design, analysis, and the presentation of findings.

"This study investigated differences in the contributions of various features to in-person (IP) and video-mediated (VM) meetings. We focused on estimating important utterances using both an IP and a VM meeting corpora as the analysis data. A transformer model with dialogue history was used to estimate important utterances, and five types of input (text, speaker's audio, others' audio, speaker's video, and others' video) were fed to the model. A comparison of the models for IP and VM revealed that the speaker's audio has a strong effect on the IP model, the video of the other participants strongly affects the VM model, and the text and others' audio strongly affects both models in estimating important utterances. © 2023 IEEE."

"Background: There is a tendency nowadays to restore large defects in primary dentition with pediatric crowns instead of conventional restorations. Thus, understanding the factors contributing to the survival or failure of dental crowns in pediatric dentistry is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes. Objective: The primary objective of this protocol is to outline the methodological approach for analyzing data from observational studies and randomized controlled trials to investigate reasons for the failure of dental crowns in primary teeth and to compute their survival and failure rates. Methods: A comprehensive literature review will be performed in electronic databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science. As per predefined inclusion criteria, we will include observational studies (prospective clinical studies) and randomized clinical trials that have an English abstract and involve children aged 1-10 years undergoing crown restorations. Two independent reviewers will independently screen all retrieved records and full-text articles and extract data. The study’s methodological quality will be appraised using suitable tools. Assessments of publication bias will be performed using funnel plots. The findings will be described qualitatively for the systematic review. If possible, a meta-analysis will be performed to estimate failure rates by dividing the number of failures by the total exposure time. A Poisson regression model, assuming constant event rates, will be used to compute 3-year and 5-year survival proportions. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistics will be used to assess the heterogeneity of the model. A P value <.05 will be considered significant. All analyses will be performed using R Statistical software (version 4.1.2; R Core Team). Results: This systematic review and synthesis aim to assess the survival and failure rates of dental crowns in pediatric dentistry. By following this rigorous methodology, we seek to provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to the success or failure of these restorations. The results of our full review will have implications for pediatric dentists, researchers, and policy makers, helping to improve dental care for children. Conclusions: This systematic review protocol helps in establishing a thorough approach for reviewing failures in pediatric crowns. By following this methodology, standardization and transparency of the process as well as accountability for the stated methods and outcomes will be ensured. The findings of this review and analysis will provide useful data on the survival of crowns to pediatric dentists and researchers.

"The last decade witnessed the proliferation of automated content analysis in communication research. However, existing computational tools have been taken up unevenly, with powerful deep learning algorithms such as transformers rarely applied as compared to lexicon-based dictionaries. To enable social scientists to adopt modern computational methods for valid and reliable sentiment analysis of English text, we propose an open and free web service named transformer- and lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TLSA). TLSA integrates diverse tools and offers validation metrics, empowering users with limited computational knowledge and resources to reap the benefit of state-of-the-art computational methods. Two cases demonstrate the functionality and usability of TLSA. The performance of different tools varied to a large extent based on the dataset, supporting the importance of validating various sentiment tools in a specific context. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"We address the difficulty of automatic misinformation detection through state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. Machine learning and natural language processing are often touted as the perfect solutions for the problem of detecting misinformation at scale. We argue, however, that current approaches tend to fall short because of the unavailability of reliably annotated data. Given the scarcity of quality labelled data, we first conduct a data collection effort by leveraging fact-checking websites. Second, we perform a comparative feature analysis of the news articles with true vs false content. Finally, we conduct a set of text classification experiments using a variety of methods and show that the quality of the training data in terms of its labelling system and balanced coverage of topics directly affects the classification accuracy on test data (news articles that the classifier did not see during training). Feature analysis experiments show specific trends of linguistic patterns in fake news articles. In predictive classification, some of these features such as n-grams and semantic features help considerably in recognising false from true news articles and some features such as readability features tend to be less helpful. We also compare deep learning classification models against feature-based models and show that, given the small size of currently available data, feature-based models are more capable of cross-topic generalisation. This result points to the need for automatic classification methods that are informed by linguistic, corpus linguistic, and stylistic research. Finally, we show that using data labelled based on the reputation of the sources does not result in accurate classification of test data, which, in turn, motivates future data collection with reliable tagging and on diverse topics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"To understand the variants of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Auto-encoders, we first need to outline what they are: RBMs are generative and unlike auto-encoders that are biased towards a limited set of data. RBMs are capable of generating new data with the joint set distribution. They are used to solve problems such as pattern recognition where there is a handwritten text that needs to be deciphered or a random pattern. It can also be used for recommendation engines where in collaboration with filtering techniques, recommendations are made to an end-user, and radar target recognition where it is used to detect intra-pulse with extremely low SNR and high noise. On the contrary, auto-encoders are not very commonly used in real-life applications; however, they are useful in reducing dimensionality and variational auto-encoders (VAE), where VAE learns the limitations of a probability distribution modeling the input data rather than learning the absolute function. RBMs and auto-encoders can be used for cyber-physical systems (CPS); RBMs are a dual-layer, two-part, erratic graphical model, allowing data to flow in two ways rather than one which forms the foundation of DBNs. CPS aims to use RBMs in making the model understand various functions, which will ultimately help to identify the hidden state and minimize the energy of the system. RBMs assign probabilities rather than definite values. Auto-encoders are unsupervised neural networks that use input vectors and try to match them to similar output vectors. These vectors are extremely skilled as they study compressed data encoding autonomously. This chapter will discuss in detail the breakthroughs with CPS and their findings. Previously CPS were only evaluated with techniques that did not differentiate the facts from the internal view, which ultimately resulted in a mismatch between the behavior of theoretical models and their real-life counterparts. This ultimately gave way to the question of how they could perform critical safety tasks. Another vital breakthrough related to CPS revolves around Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts. They both revolve around the design and analysis of Artificial Intelligence as an integral part of CPS; the findings for these breakthroughs will be discussed in detail in the chapter. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, [Ali Ismail Awad, Atif Ahmad, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, Saqib Hakak]; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Social context is data such as user relationships and user experiences with information. Online commercial websites produce a significant amount of textual information every day through consumer reviews, comments, suggestions and tweets. Social media site comments have become a valuable resource for producers to evaluate public opinion about their goods. Firstly, any stop words and noise data such as links, the social media comments are deleted and pre-processed. In the emotion lexicon, the data is then matched and the second matching is achieved in the emoticon dictionary when the first matching succeeds. The emoticons are translated into vector form in the emoticon dictionary. The emotional features are vectored through this matching and other text features are considered. Lastly, for sentiment classification, the machine learning classification system is used. The results of the experiment indicate that emoticons have a strong impact on promoting the classification of social media posts by sentiment, and the suggested method of classification of sentiment obtained better than average results in terms of classification accuracy relative to state-of-the-art techniques. © 2023 CRC Press."
"This textbook provides students with the skills and techniques necessary to analyse business case studies from a strategic perspective. With career development and impact in mind, the book goes beyond simply listing tools, instead teaching students how to prepare for a major strategic business case analysis project, how to position their analysis on a spectrum from reductionist to holistic approaches, how to critically engage with theory and case data, as well as how to leverage their work after completion. A logical approach is offered, taking the reader through the analysis journey, from preparing to analyse a case study to conducting the analysis and maximising the impact going forwards. A comprehensive analysis task is incorporated, which asks the reader to reflect on a range of case data, understand the choices of analytical positioning and tool selection, and develop an analysis based on this positioning. Further pedagogical features include: Reflective practice exercises at the end of chapters, allowing the student to self-identify areas of strength and weakness as they develop through the process. Worked examples based on cases reproduced in the book, allowing the student to follow the analytical process that the author went through in different analysis modes. Quotes and analysis insights from former students who have previously conducted a strategic business case analysis, aiding reflective practice. As case study analysis continues as a core component of teaching across business schools, this unique text will help to build key skills in advanced undergraduate, postgraduate, MBA, and executive education students conducting strategic business case analysis. Support material includes PowerPoint slides as well as video content. © 2024 Christopher Williams."
"There are many ways to engage with music as an activity-ways that Christopher Small collectively indicated with the gerund verb “musicking.” In the wake of Small’s musicking concept, the critique, dissection, analysis, history, and aesthetic interpretation of music have long been acknowledged as performative, embodied, and culturally situated. However, the implications of this acknowledgement for the constitution of subject positions and agencies of music researchers and musical performers have largely remained unaccounted for, with gaps between various performative trades, communities, epistemic traditions, and regimes that prove to be challenging to bridge. This chapter engages with these gaps through the presentation of some music-cultural encounters that thrive on how musical individuals from different backgrounds appropriate, re-spell, and re-ground the ideas, skills, thoughts, and practices they encounter through multiple acts of musicking. Subject positions-such as being a musician or a researcher (or both), or being privileged or marginalised-crystallise temporarily through various modes of knowledge inscription (sonic, verbal, visual, gestural) on various bodies of knowledge (musical instruments, human bodies, social groups, repertoires, staged performances, texts, and discourses). This chapter deliberately focuses on a part of the world in which such crystallisations have acquired extremely violent dimensions in colonial, apartheid, and global industrial times, namely Namibia and South Africa. Still, the tensions and disjunctions, as well as the moments of community and togetherness that emerge from these encounters, are by no means unique to these countries. They invite us to ask questions about how we ground, position and orientate ourselves through acts of musicking. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, John Koslovsky and Michiel Schuijer; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Scientific data available on the internet is rarely labelled. Most popular research paper repository sites contain papers without any annotation for grouping data. Classification of text via words, sentences and even paragraphs has become a key resource for a lot of industries looking to help their computers understand human language – the next stage in Artificial Intelligence. Using valuable Computational Linguistics ideas, some industrial applications have been able to streamline their processes to effectively and efficiently process and interpret language data. Continuing in this trend, in this paper, we aim to effectively clustering scientific research papers into topic-based differentiators, in the most efficient manner. Using multiple algorithms that have revolutionized the industry in the previous years, we compute over 800,000 entries of scientific research articles across 200+ domains that have been uploaded to accurately predict domains for each of these articles. We use clustering techniques like the K-Means algorithm to derive the topics for these papers with an accuracy of nearly 80%. We also use BERT to create topic clusters that generate topics based on frequently occurring contexts within the text. Beyond BERT, we use offspring algorithms that tackle specific, niche issues that BERT does not account for. We also fine-tune the parameters of the algorithms used to generate over 50 stronger topics that more accurately define scientific articles. © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."
"This article was prepared as a prerequisite for the completion of the Pragmatics Applied to Teaching Portuguese as an Additional Language (PAL) course offered by the Graduate Program in Literature at PUCRS. As part of an extracurricular activity at the same institution, four field visits were conducted to a PLA class, where a research study was carried out. To that end, the participating students signed a consent form and filled out a questionnaire to gather personal information, such as their length of residence in Brazil and their study of the Portuguese language. Observations with notes and recordings were also made, along with the administration of a Discourse Completion Task (DCT). Through data analysis, it was observed that many of the students used a lower degree of politeness than what was expected in the speech situation, such as using tu instead of senhor(a), or disregarding the use of discourse markers like gostaria and poderia. To overcome this situation, three lesson plans were developed, and the aim here is to describe the process and present these plans. They contain diverse activities and didactic sequences typically aimed at teaching language structures adapted for work focused on Pragmatics, specifically on politeness in speech acts as proposed by Brown and Levinson (1987). It is expected that this text can contribute to arousing educators interest in teaching that considers the adequacy between linguistic production and context, as well as providing practical ideas for the classroom. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The present study assumes that the uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic has instilled fear among consumers and will show evident changes in their spending habits due to uncertainty and changes in priorities. The inclusion criteria for participants could be anyone who was voluntarily participating to share their experiences as the turmoil of the health crisis is faced by each and all. Interpretations of the audio recordings of the interviews were based on numerous hearings of every recording to confine the holistic representation of the participants stories, followed by a part-by-part explanation of key opinions in hand-written text. The theory emerges from the analysis of data from prior participants, which guides the selection of appropriate subsequent interviews. The study is based on retrospective interpretations of past personal experiences and it was assumed that the participants liberally reminisced significant aspects of precedent experiences and presumed to be repeated shortly, both of which may not be accurate. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Philip Kotler, Subhadip Roy, Satyajit Chakrabarti, Dipak Saha and Rabin Mazumder; individual chapters, the contributors."
"At the centre of these reflections is a new theory of intersemiotic textuality. It refers to various types of sign systems and artefacts (e.g. images). The new theory is based on three hypotheses. Firstly, the theory of a text does not exclusively refer to linguistic signs. Secondly, the textual level beyond the sentence cannot be described in terms of linguistic categories that are analogous to syntax. There is no “grammar” of text; texts are organized on the basis of principles of their own. And, thirdly, the text linguistic set of constitutive categories according to De Beaugrande and Dressler has to be revised. The analysis of texts from Dada serves to provide evidence in favour of this new approach. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Matthias Bauer and Angelika Zirker; individual chapters, the contributors."
"This text presents an analysis of the field of Trans Studies through the lens of Gibbons et al.‘s Mode 2 Knowledge Production (“Mode 2"")-a poststructuralist framework of scientific research that classifies the shift in academia over the past half century. As Trans Studies is an emergent field of interventionist and collaborative research that advocates self-auditing, it appears at first sight to epitomise Mode 2. However, I argue that this field-while undoubtedly successful in many ways-falls short of this paradigm, specifically regarding the accountability essential to Mode 2 Knowledge Production. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Edyta Just, Maria Udén, Vera Weetzel, and Cecilia Åsberg; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Temporal video action segmentation (TVAS) is a challenging problem in analyzing and understanding long-term video content. Action segmentation attracts significant interest from both researchers and practitioners to many applications such as video editing in social media, surveillance in security, robotics, daily activities in instructional videos, and sports analysis. This paper addresses the action segmentation problem in videos including procedural activities as a supervised approach. We proposed an end-to-end framework to segment video streams by applying the sliding window method and state-of-the-art deep models. First, proposed pipeline extracts spatiotemporal features from the input video. Second, with the supervised approach with the sliding window method, we applied domain-specific segmentation task which belongs to the text segmentation domain to video domain. Third, we performed action classification with Transformer and 3D ConvNet enabling us to combine consecutive frames and optical flow to predict each atomic action in the video. Inspired by the success of the sliding window approach in text segmentation, we assigned an atomic action class to each frame in the video sequence and implemented end-to-end temporal video action segmentation pipeline. We present state-of-the-art experimental results on two small-scale benchmarks with small datasets including 50Salads and magnetic wall chess. Our experimental results exhibit the efficiency of our methodology. © 2023 IEEE."

"The presence of illegal, harmful content, rumors, misinformation, and Twitter bots has con-sistently brought the social media platforms such as Twitter into the spotlight. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise caution when analyzing tweets. To establish the credibility of any patterns and findings derived from tweets, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the source and authenticity of the tweets in question. This paper advances in this direction by introduc-ing a novel approach involving bot detection and a comparative analysis of human and bot-generated tweets related to the farmers’ protest. A framework for knowledge differentiation is deployed to accomplish this goal. The framework unearths the global perspectives of people about Indian farmers’ protests, in the form of stances, the results of which serve as nuggets of knowledge derived at the lower level of abstraction. Unexpected results of stance detection motivated the study of bot detection in each tweet of each stance. Knowledge discovered by bot detection and characterization studies was thus built over stance detection and yielded higher-order knowledge nuggets, which identified the widespread presence of bots in tweets both for and against the protest, thus establishing the misuse of social media platforms like Twitter to influence and control the narrative of the social events that significantly impact people’s lives. Characterization of issues being tweeted by humans vs. bots in favor of and against farmers’ protests was accomplished by conducting a comparative analysis of N-grams in each category. Vocabulary analysis established that texts tweeted by bots mimicked the vocabulary pattern of the tweets by human users. Research inferences such as these can be invaluable for policy makers, enabling them to gain a macro-level understanding of the situations on the ground level and leverage such information for making policy decisions, in order to be prepared to handle similar situations in the future. © 2023 Sarabjeet Kaur Kochhar and Chinmay Chahar."
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their ability to generate human-like text and facilitate conversational interactions. However, the majority of LLMs are majorly developed for English, limiting their accessibility and effectiveness for non-English speaking populations. In India, where only 10% of the population is proficient in English, the need for LLM models adapted to regional languages becomes crucial. This research paper focuses on the adaptability of LLMs to the Odia language, spoken by approximately 50 million people in India. With a primary objective to cater to the Odia-speaking community, we aim to evaluate existing LLM models such as ChatGPT, and Olive, an instruction following Odia LLM, specifically in the context of generating conversational outputs in Odia. We employ a critical evaluation approach to assess the performance, language understanding, and response generation capabilities of the LLM models for the Odia language. By conducting experiments and comparative analysis, we seek to determine the strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement for the existing LLM models. Our findings will contribute to the development of more effective and contextually accurate generative chatbots for the Odia language, enabling better communication and accessibility for the Odia-speaking population.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Hu and Nation's (2000) study, which stipulated that second language (L2) readers need to be familiar with 98% of lexical items for adequate text comprehension, has become highly influential in L2 vocabulary research and pedagogy. However, the 98% critical threshold figure is based on findings from a research project in which a regression analysis was conducted with only 66 university students in New Zealand. The present study replicated Hu and Nation's research in a context different from a typical Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic context with a sample of 104 Sri Lankan adult L2 learners in a nonacademic context. They each took a Vocabulary Levels Test and read one of five versions of two reading texts at different levels of density of unknown words before answering comprehension questions.

"This chapter explores the discourses of climate change denialism in a corpus of texts mentioning climate change and global warming from 186 websites and blogs known to promote pseudoscience and conspiracy. After comparing this corpus to the English Web 2020 corpus (enTenTen20) for keywords, keyword co-occurrence analytical approach was used. The analysis revealed that all the tactics and arguments known to have been developed and promulgated by conservative think tanks (funded by the fossil fuel industry) have permeated online blogs and websites promoting pseudoscience and conspiracy. Additionally, the analysis shows that while outright denial of climate change is common on these websites, texts are more likely to focus on downplaying the seriousness of climate change. It is argued that downplaying the seriousness of climate change is a subtler and more believable strategy in comparison to outright denial, which is harder to believe in the face of growing scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"Emotion detection systems play a crucial role in enhancing human-computer interaction. Existing systems predominantly rely on machine learning techniques. This study introduces a novel emotion detection method that employs deep learning techniques to identify five basic human emotions and the pleasure dimensions (valence) associated with these emotions, using text and keystroke dynamics. To facilitate this, we develop a non-acted dataset, DEKT-345 × 2, which includes text and keystroke features. The dataset is created by inducing emotions in participants under controlled conditions. Deep learning models are subsequently employed to predict a person’s affective state using textual content. Semantic analysis of the text data is achieved by employing the global vector (Glove) representation of words. For both text and keystroke-based analysis, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D), long short-term memory (LSTM), sandwich Conv1D, and sandwich LSTM models are employed. The robustness of our proposed method is assessed using the DEKT-345 × 2 dataset, which collects text and keystroke information from 69 participants. Through parameter tuning on training and validation data, we establish models that demonstrate superior performance compared to five related approaches and three machine learning classifiers. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 88.57% using the LSTM model, 80% using the sandwich LSTM model, 71.42% using the Conv1D model, and 51.48% using the sandwich Conv1D model on text data across the five emotion classes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"This paper introduces a crowdsourced text story dataset using the story card images of a commercial storytelling board game. We collect 705 text stories using illustration cards, where each story is classified with its ending type - either a happy or sad ending. Then, the sentiment patterns for a series of illustration cards matching each text story are analyzed to explore possible emotional arcs present in each story. The most dominant sentiment pattern is Negative-Negative-Positive (N-N-P) in happy-ending stories; Negative-Negative-Negative (N-N-N) in sad-ending stories. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Aim: To use co-design principles to design a nationwide maternity experiences survey and to distribute the survey through social media. Design: A co-designed, cross sectional, and national online survey. Methods: Using co-design principles from study design and throughout the research process a cross-sectional, online, national survey of Australian women's experiences of maternity care was designed. Four validated survey instruments were included in the survey design. Results: An extensive social media strategy was utilized, which included paid advertising, resulting in 8804 surveys for analysis and 54,896 comments responding to open text questions. Discussion: The inclusion of co-design principles contributed to a well-designed survey and consumer involvement in distribution and support of the online survey. The social media distribution strategy contributed to high participation rates with overall low marketing costs. Clinical Relevance: Maternity services should be designed to provide woman-centered, individualized care. This survey was co-designed with maternity users and maternity organizations to explore women's recent experiences of maternity care in Australia. The outcomes of this study will highlight the factors that contribute to positive and negative experiences in maternity services. Patient or Public Contribution: As a co-designed study, there was consumer engagement from the design of the study, throughout the research process. © 2023 The Authors.

"The article is devoted to the development of the concept of an intelligent system for diagnosing deviant states of individuals based on text analysis using mainly the following text analysis tools: convolutional neural networks, algorithms used by psychiatrists in detecting deviant states of individuals (such as extremism, suicidality, etc.), as well as the theory of information images/representations. Such a system makes it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of identifying such conditions as compared to classical monitoring methods based on content analysis. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article examines how particular frames of military violence emerge, solidify, and fracture around popular media representations of veteran-led protest in response to the Northern Ireland legacy investigations. Curious about how popular ‘pro-militarist’ media navigate unsettling incidents of extreme and unlawful military violence that anti-activism draws attention to, this article uses a discourse analysis of the news coverage of the activism to interrogate how boundaries, distinct to those of formal legal and truth-seeking mechanisms, between ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ violences, are drawn. Based on an analysis of 372 photographs and their attendant texts from 72 online news articles, I argue that the coverage is organized around an understanding of military violence as natural and necessary, (re)producing a largely untroubled fantasy of a homogenous national community betrayed by the investigation of its ‘squaddies’. In allowing only partial ruptures in an otherwise smooth narrative of military heroism and betrayal by the state, these stories of military transgression inhibit the disruptive potential of state-led investigations by obscuring the violence they supposedly seek to address. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: Non-attendance to outpatient mental health appointments is associated with adverse clinical and financial outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of non-attendance to outpatient Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) appointments and the factors associated with non-attendance. Subjects and Methods: Retrospective cohort study, including two groups of data: 950 initial and 3503 follow-up appointments between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2019. We employed descriptive statistics, parametric/non-parametric tests and logistic regression analysis. We used a range of environmental, socio-demographic and service-related characteristics as independent parameters and non-attendance as the dependent parameter. Results: Initial and follow-up non-attendance rates were 27.5% and 18.8% respectively. Opting-out text message reminders was associated with both initial and follow-up non-attendance. Higher education was associated with initial non-attendance, whereas lower education with follow-up non-attendance. Other factors associated with non-attendance to initial appointments were: English being the participant's primary communication language, having an appointment with a psychiatrist as opposed to a trained nurse or Cognitive Behavioural Therapist, and longer waiting time. Follow-up non-attendance was also associated with younger age, shorter driving distance and higher income/employment. Conclusions: We suggest that improving opt-in rates through a combination of staff and patient education and promotion, improving waiting lists, reducing the stigma associated with seeing a psychiatrist, but also perhaps targeting different socio-economic groups of patients with different strategies should be the focus of policy making to tackle non-attendance. Further research into patient-related and environmental factors, such as day of the week, driving distance, language of primary communication, education, income and employment is warranted in order to design more effective policies and improve engagement with CLP, but also psychiatric services in general. © 2023 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

"Recent political excursions into classroom text selections by local and national politicians and pundits have made teaching canonical texts more appealing to many school districts and teachers. In this study, we used conceptions of Derridean hospitality alongside monster theory to examine what common canonical texts teach students about who is welcome and worthy of hospitality in American society and who is viewed as wholly monstrous and outside the bounds of hospitality. The results of our critical content analysis revealed that in commonly taught canonical novels, identity categories like race and gender shape determinations of who is welcome and who is othered. The findings suggest that critical readings of canonical texts cannot offer a hospitable welcome to marginalized and othered youth in ELA classrooms. Instead we offer a hospitable literacy approach to text selection in ELA classrooms. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The internet has a significant impact on how businesses are conducted globally today, and the tourism industry is no exception. According to the Statista 2020 survey, there were 4.13 billion Internet users worldwide in 2019. Tourist satisfaction affects destination selection, consumption, return visits, and reputation. The sentiment analysis technique was applied to analyze the data qualitatively. The most significant factor about which the tourists seemed to care was cleanliness. Most tourists were overwhelmed by the sheer number of people at a location on any given day. Security was a significant factor that the tourists considered. Many tourists complained of pickpocketers while others clearly stated having their things stolen, including their wallets. The current study’s findings suggest that tourist guides, photographers, and management must properly serve tourists to create positive E-WOM. Future studies can be taken in different parts of the world to know the composition of tourist satisfaction traits. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Philip Kotler, Subhadip Roy, Satyajit Chakrabarti, Dipak Saha and Rabin Mazumder; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Purpose: Drawing on the pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD) emotion model, the emotional states of consumers embedded in online reviews can be described through three dimensions, that is, pleasure, arousal and dominance, rather than only the one-dimensional positive and negative polarity, as in previous studies. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effect of online review emotion on perceived review helpfulness based on these three basic emotional dimensions. Design/methodology/approach: A lexicon-based method is developed to analyze PAD emotions of online reviews from JD.com. The zero-inflated negative binomial regression is utilized to empirically validate the study hypothesis. The authors examine the influence of pleasure, arousal, dominance, emotion diversity and emotion deviation on review helpfulness, as well as the moderating effect of product type on the relationship between all independent variables and online review helpfulness. Findings: The study results show that the pleasure emotion impairs the helpfulness of online reviews, while the arousal and dominance emotions have a positive impact. Moreover, the authors find that compared with search products, the effects of pleasure, arousal and dominance on perceived helpfulness are strengthened for experience products. However, the emotional diversity and emotional deviation have opposite effects on the helpfulness of search products and experience products. Additionally, the results show that dominance emotion plays a more important role in the interaction effect. Originality/value: The empirical findings confirm the applicability of PAD in the online review context and extend the existing knowledge of the influence of review emotion on helpfulness. A feasible scheme for extracting PAD variables from Chinese text is developed. The study findings also have significant implications for reviewers, merchants and platform managers of e-commerce websites. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This chapter examines the ambiguity of pictorial elements in multisemiotic textures. My analysis predicts that there is often a strategic use of ambiguity in such combinations of written and pictorial elements, which aims at specific readers’ reactions. At first, it might be assumed that ambiguity avoidance is highly important in the types of texts that have a clear intentional effect. However, I will argue that, as long as a synthesis of the competing meanings is possible on a higher text level, the cognitive stalemate is part of the text itself. The ambiguous pictorial element serves to create the overall effect of an appellative, multisemiotic text(ure). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Matthias Bauer and Angelika Zirker; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Background: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are pervasive in modern biomedical science. In fact, research results suggesting algorithms and AI models for different target diseases and conditions are continuously increasing. While this situation undoubtedly improves the outcome of AI models, health care providers are increasingly unsure which AI model to use due to multiple alternatives for a specific target and the “black box” nature of AI. Moreover, the fact that studies rarely use guidelines in developing and reporting AI models poses additional challenges in trusting and adapting models for practical implementation. Objective: This review protocol describes the planned steps and methods for a review of the synthesized evidence regarding the quality of available guidelines and frameworks to facilitate AI applications in medicine. Methods: We will commence a systematic literature search using medical subject headings terms for medicine, guidelines, and machine learning (ML). All available guidelines, standard frameworks, best practices, checklists, and recommendations will be included, irrespective of the study design. The search will be conducted on web-based repositories such as PubMed, Web of Science, and the EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research) network. After removing duplicate results, a preliminary scan for titles will be done by 2 reviewers. After the first scan, the reviewers will rescan the selected literature for abstract review, and any incongruities about whether to include the article for full-text review or not will be resolved by the third and fourth reviewer based on the predefined criteria. A Google Scholar (Google LLC) search will also be performed to identify gray literature. The quality of identified guidelines will be evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. A descriptive summary and narrative synthesis will be carried out, and the details of critical appraisal and subgroup synthesis findings will be presented. Results: The results will be reported using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines. Data analysis is currently underway, and we anticipate finalizing the review by November 2023. Conclusions: Guidelines and recommended frameworks for developing, reporting, and implementing AI studies have been developed by different experts to facilitate the reliable assessment of validity and consistent interpretation of ML models for medical applications. We postulate that a guideline supports the assessment of an ML model only if the quality and reliability of the guideline are high. Assessing the quality and aspects of available guidelines, recommendations, checklists, and frameworks—as will be done in the proposed review—will provide comprehensive insights into current gaps and help to formulate future research directions. © Kirubel Biruk Shiferaw, Moritz Roloff, Dagmar Waltemath, Atinkut Alamirrew Zeleke."
"Recently, a number of approaches to train speech models by incorporating text into end-to-end models have been developed, with Maestro advancing state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST) performance. In this paper, we expand our understanding of the resulting shared speech-text representations with two types of analyses. First we examine the limits of speech-free domain adaptation, finding that a corpus-specific duration model for speech-text alignment is the most important component for learning a shared speech-text representation. Second, we inspect the similarities between activations of unimodal (speech or text) encoders as compared to the activations of a shared encoder. We find that the shared encoder learns a more compact and overlapping speech-text representation than the uni-modal encoders. We hypothesize that this partially explains the effectiveness of the Maestro shared speech-text representations. © 2023 IEEE."
"This chapter focuses on the work and network of New Woman writer and Yellow Book contributor Netta Syrett (1865–1943), illuminating her influential role as a suffrage writer in a fin-de-siècle feminist literary community. As well as mapping Syrett’s connections to prestigious women’s suffrage campaigners, this chapter traces the increasing politicisation of her work in its focus on two almost entirely unexplored texts preoccupied with women’s suffrage. These are: her recently published suffrage play of 1909, Might is Right, and her critically neglected novel of 1930, Portrait of a Rebel which was adapted into the famous film A Woman Rebels (1936), starring Katharine Hepburn. An analysis of these two texts in conjunction offers insight into Syrett’s understudied works and traces her authorial evolution over the course of her career in response to the women’s suffrage campaign, while demonstrating her important if largely forgotten contribution to early feminist literature. © 2023 Taylor and Francis."
"This chapter reports on an implementation of inoculation theory, which was devised at the University of Salento and which aims to educate people to resist persuasion as well as to enhance their critical thinking by means of engaging and interactive multimedia texts. The implementation under discussion resorts to memes, the viral text types that are shared over the Internet and which can be used to spread misinformation. In this study, memes are presented as a tool helping to counteract fabrication in fake news. Twenty-six undergraduate students in modern literatures, representing people that communicate online and consume online texts, were asked to design memes where the interaction between linguistic and extralinguistic elements is meant to produce humorous and derogatory representations that should attract the recipients’ interests before proposing to them facts about the COVID-19 pandemic from reliable sources. The analysis of the selected corpus of samples will illustrate the extent to which the multimodal composition of the original creations activates inferential processes whereby addressees are urged to question the truthfulness of the fake news items that are diffused via social media posts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"This paper provides a reconstruction and analysis of Marx’s early engagements with logic, and especially his studies of Hegel’s logic, on the one hand, and Hegel’s great if often overlooked critic Adolf Trendelenburg, on the other. It itemises the archival evidence that Marx read and planned to compose a Hegelian response to Trendelenburg’s devastating attack on dialectics in his 1840 Logische Untersuchungen – the work that arguably did more than any other single text to destroy the influence of Hegelianism among German intellectuals at the time. It argues that the young Marx was a more sophisticated reader of Hegel and of philosophy in general than is typically acknowledged. Against the backdrop of these claims, it then proposes a new reading of Marx’s work from 1839 to 1842 – one that takes the emphasis off the familiar distinction between materialism and idealism, which was as much an invention of Engels’s later interpretations of the early Marx as it was an invention of Marx himself, and places it instead on what early nineteenth-century thinkers would have understood to be the more comprehensive question of logic. © Charles Barbour, 2023."
"The focus of this article is the reflection of intelligence as ability in social media texts. The authors have developed a model of communicative environments according to which the manifestation of intelligence in a message depends on the communicative situation in which the information is transmitted. Thus, the cognitive complexity of texts is a consequence not only of the author’s intellectual capacity, but also of his will-ingness and ability to adapt the complexity of messages to the characteristics of the recipient. This paper analyses data from individual social media profiles in relation to user intelligence test scores, as well as similar data obtained at a regional level. The study involved 438 subjects who took an intelligence test and provided access to their social media profiles. Facebook3users were found to be, on average, more intelligent than VKontakte users, posting more posts containing text, posting less often overall. No significant differences in post characteristics were found between the two social networks. However, differences in the nature of the relationship between intelligence and cognitive complexity of messages were demonstrated for different social networks and for male and female subsamples of users. Correlations were found to be higher at the regional level compared to the individual level, higher for Facebook compared to VKontakte and higher for men compared to women. It is concluded that indicators of texts’ cognitive complexity from social media do reflect the intelligence of their authors, but the extent of this reflection depends on the characteristics of the communicative situation. © 2023, Russian Academy of Sciences.

"Disputes are common and widespread in subcontracting practices and would ultimately lead to litigation resulting in significant negative consequences including delay, increased cost, and tarnished reputation of contracting parties. Although considerable studies have analyzed disputes in construction projects, research efforts still fall short in investigating causes of disputes in subcontracting practices. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper investigated the causes of disputes in subcontracting practices by automatically examining 3150 litigation cases that are publicly available in China using text mining and NLP (natural language processing) techniques. Documents of litigation cases were presented into vectors by data preprocessing and vector presentation. Clustering analysis of the data was conducted by using an improved K-Means model, K-Means++. Finally, 37 causes of disputes were discovered in the subcontracting litigation cases. Results showed that variations due to unforeseen circumstances, labor service issues from subcontractors, disagreement on engineering quantities between subcontractors and other contracting parties, invalid signature of subcontractors for obtaining more payment, payment issues between subcontractors and clients or general contractors, contradictory on the return of performance bond, disagreement on the interest of late payment, and arrears issues suffered by subcontractors were the top eight significant causes of disputes in subcontracting practices in China. This study contributes by systematically exploring the causes of disputes in subcontracting practices using automated text analysis approaches instead of manual content analysis. The findings of this study can provide construction practitioners a deeper understanding of disputes in subcontracting and thereby helping them increase their capacity to handle disputes. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This study focused on the use of anticipation guides (AG) as a reading strategy to support science reading and explored the level of students’ scientific written arguments as a result. An AG consists of four components that address the topic of the reading activity: statements about the content, what I think, what the texts say, and evidence in the text. These components create a bridge to explore and assess students’ scientific written arguments at the end of the course. We employed a case study with an embedded quasi-experimental design to analyse the impact of using an AG, along with a thematic analysis to report students’ perceptions. The present study involved 40 college students (prospective physics teachers) in the Department of Physics Education, taking a course in the Fundamentals of Physics. The findings show that the use of an AG significantly affected students’ scientific written arguments, specifically in proposing a claim-reasoning-evidence (CRE) structure. The student participants found that using an AG in reading activities was challenging but interesting because they had to find evidence in the texts to support their initial statements regarding what they thought. We also discuss the implications of this study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Background: Traumatic thoracolumbar spine injuries are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Targeted for non-spine specialist trauma surgeons, this systematic scoping review aimed to examine literature for up-to-date evidence on presentation, management, and outcomes of thoracolumbar spine injuries in adult trauma patients. Methods: This review was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. We searched four bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible studies included experimental, observational, and evidence-synthesis articles evaluating patients with thoracic, lumbar, or thoracolumbar spine injury, published in English between January 1, 2010 and January 31, 2021. Studies which focused on animals, cadavers, cohorts with N <30, and pediatric cohorts (age <18 years old), as well as case studies, abstracts, and commentaries were excluded. Results: A total of 2501 studies were screened, of which 326 unique studies were fully text reviewed and twelve aspects of injury management were identified and discussed: injury patterns, determination of injury status and imaging options, considerations in management, and patient quality of life. We found: (1) imaging is a necessary diagnostic tool, (2) no consensus exists for preferred injury characterization scoring systems, (3) operative management should be considered for unstable fractures, decompression, and deformity, and (4) certain patients experience significant burden following injury. Discussion: In this systematic scoping review, we present the most up-to-date information regarding the management of traumatic thoracolumbar spine injuries. This allows non-specialist trauma surgeons to become more familiar with thoracolumbar spine injuries in trauma patients and provides a framework for their management. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This research aimed to analyze the use of abbreviations in the Kazakh language using a machine learning approach. Studies of the most commonly used words-abbreviations in Kazakh texts, as well as analysis and classification were carried out. Several machine learning models, tc, including naive Bayes, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) were tested for the study. The linguistic corpus was used for the experimental part Abbreviations-abb.xml and abbreviations.csv. The results showed that SVM outperformed other models with an accuracy of 0.85. The unique features of the Kazakh language were also discussed, such as the use of the Cyrillic alphabet and complex word forms. The implications of this study for natural language processing and computational linguistics were presented, and the limitations of the study were discussed. This study contributes to understanding the use of abbreviations in the Kazakh language and demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches to analyze languages with complex characteristics. © 2023 IEEE."
"The text seminar has a long and strong tradition in academia, not least in postgraduate education. In these seminars, doctoral students are socialised into the research community to be able to act as researchers in an academic setting. However, research suggests that the traditional and strictly regulated form of doctoral seminars may hinder doctoral students’ learning. In response to this problem, this article presents and discusses an analysis of an attempt to redesign doctoral education seminars in Sweden by a design theoretic approach to learning. The result shows that while certain seminar forms functioned as somewhat limiting for learning, other forms and multimodal resources were able to open for alternative meaning-making and ways of staging the identity of a researcher. ©2023 Cecilia Björck & Monica Lindgren.

"The field of multimedia analysis has been increasingly focused on image-text retrieval, which aims to retrieve semantically relevant images or text through queries of the opposite modality. The key challenge is to learn the correspondence between images and text. Existing methods have focused on processing inter-modality information interaction but have not given sufficient attention to learning the correspondence between the two modalities during this process. However, these methods have a low accurate image-text matching due to they are not deal with the noise during the process of the visual and textual representations. To avoid the noise in the training process, we propose a novel Multi-head Similarity Feature Representation and Filtration (MSFRF) approach for image-text matching. The proposed MSFRF method captures the detailed associations of feature representations from different modalities and reduces the interference of noisy information in the extracted features for improving the performance of matching. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed MSFRF method outperforms the state-of-the-art image-text matching methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"Lacanian Psychoanalysis and American Literature considers the psychoanalytic applications of three classic works of nineteenth-century literature, applying Lacanian concepts throughout. Moncayo imports the dynamisms and texture of three English and American stories with the aim of developing psychoanalytic theory, rather than simply confirming or applying previously adopted psychoanalytic concepts and theory. The author begins with The Purloined Letter by Edgar Allan Poe, assessing the differences between Derrida's and Lacan’s analysis of this famous story. The book then considers The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, using James’ text for an in-depth analysis of Lacan’s Seminar on the Logic of the Fantasy, and Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, considering ""passage à l'acte"", and the objet a as the Wind and Heart of the Signifier. The authors use Lacan’s later theories to cast a new interpretative light on the stories, much as Lacan himself did with the work of James Joyce. Lacanian Psychoanalysis and American Literature will be of interest to academics and scholars of literary studies, psychoanalytic and Lacanian studies, and Philosophy. © 2024 Raul Moncayo."
"Sentiment analysis of waste management in Bandung and its surrounding areas is the focus of this research. Previous research has shown that many respondents are dissatisfied with the city's waste management practices and criticize inadequate services. Therefore, further sentiment analysis is needed to understand the public's view of waste management in Bandung. This study obtained opinion data from social media sites like Twitter and Instagram. We chose the Multinomial Naive Bayes method as the analytical model for the text classifier and implemented it using the CRISP-DM framework. The analysis results show the model's accuracy in predicting sentiment is 0.75. In addition, the results of sentiment analysis using the N-Gram approach found that many people still are unaware of waste management in Bandung by littering. This research helps us understand the waste management issue in Bandung and its surroundings. The government, related institutions, and the public can take advantage of the sentiment analysis findings as a reminder and evaluation of waste management problems in Bandung. © 2023 IEEE."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a task of identifying fine-grained sentiment entities in a given sentence, which is generally formulated as a sequence labeling problem. Recently, advancements in large pre-trained language models (PLMs) led to generative ABSA, where the task is treated as text-to-text transition resolved by fine-tuning PLMs. Although the generative methods are designed to capture sentence-level semantic information, they are inappropriate for explicit comprehension of sentiment structure. In order to address this issue, we propose sentiment element named entity recognition (SENER) for ABSA. SENER integrates the concepts of named entity recognition (NER) and generative ABSA to retrieve the sentiment entities with predefined sentiment element names, leading to better semantic and sentiment structure understanding. Experimental results on several ABSA tasks show that the proposed SENER significantly outperforms previous works on ASQP and ASTE. © 2023 IEEE."
"Information extraction (IE), one of the main tasks of natural language processing (NLP), has recently increased importance in the use of resumes. In studies on the text to extract information from the CV, sentence classification was generally made using NLP models. In this study, it is aimed to extract information by classifying all of the text groups after preprocessing such as Optical Character Recognition (OCT) and object recognition with the YOLOv8 model of the resumes. The text dataset consists of 286 resumes collected for 5 different (education, experience, talent, personal, and language) job descriptions in the IT industry. The dataset created for object recognition consists of 1198 resumes, which were collected from the open-source datasets and labeled as sets of text. BERT, BERT-t, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet were used as models. F1 score variances were used to compare the model results. In addition, the YOLOv8 model has also been reported comparatively in itself. As a result of the comparison, DistilBERT showed better results despite having a lower number of parameters than other models. © 2023 IEEE."
"Dostoevsky’s handwriting has only recently become the subject of special research. This was facilitated by a number of tasks of studying the manuscript corpus of Dostoevsky’s texts. Modern scholars often do not entirely know the grammar and graphics of the writer. A significant volume of Dostoevsky’s manuscripts is written in illegible cursive. It is not always possible for researchers to confidently determine who created the handwritten text — the author or the scribe. In many cases, there is no relatively accurate printed reproduction of manuscripts. Some of the complex texts were read mistakenly. The use of digital technologies allows us to solve some of the research tasks. One of the auxiliary tasks is to study the typology of Dostoevsky’s handwriting. By the 19th century, such common types of handwriting as correct cursive, cursive and calligraphy had historically developed in Russia. There are different definitions of these concepts, but their meaning is most precisely explained by the semantics of words. The correct cursive reproduces the outlines of letters and words according to samples. Everyone learned to write properly according to cursive workbooks, but everyone had their own handwriting. In life, a person usually managed with one handwriting, as a rule, cursive. Tachygraphic writing is functional. Its task is to simplify the spelling of letters and speed up the writing process. Regular tachygraphic writing is legible, but rapid tachygraphic writing is not always legible. Calligraphy is often equated with correct cursive, but it was penmanship that was taught in cursive copybooks — beautiful handwriting according to the prescribed samples is dead. Dostoevsky wrote not by craft, but by inspiration, out of love for art. Patterns are excluded in Dostoevsky’s calligraphy — it’s all about personal skill. It is enough to recall the multiplication of calligraphies by Myshkin in the novel “The Idiot.” Dostoevsky adds four more original calligraphies to the five famous ones through Myshkin’s words. There is no such analysis in research literature. Dostoevsky aspired to a variety of handwritings. In his understanding, the letter expressed the spirit, the national character of a person and people, the meaning of speech and words. It is necessary to detail the types of Dostoevsky’s handwriting. © В. Н. Захаров, 2023"
"We carried out the present meta-analysis study to secure the reliability generalization of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Scale (CAMM) based on its reliability findings in different studies. The study only considered full-text papers in English that were indexed in Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus and presented a Cronbach’s alpha value of the measurements with the CAMM (209 alpha values out of 155 papers). Using the random effects model and the Bonnet transformation, the relevant analyses yielded the transformed Cronbach’s alpha value of the CAMM to be 0.80 (CI = 0.79-0.81). The present meta-analysis study concluded that the CAMM is rather reliable to be utilized in child and adolescent populations. Besides, moderator analyses to scrutinize the alpha values yielded significant differences in favor of the origin continent of the research and the CAMM-short version (25-item/10-item). Yet, it was not the case with the publication type and the adaptation status of the scale. In a nutshell, future research may confidently employ the 10-item short form of the CAMM to assess mindfulness among children and adolescents. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This study of Alex Ross’s work traces the transmedia affordances of his Kingdom Come work for DC Comics and Marvels work for Marvel Comics, beginning with a multimodal analysis of the books and characters. From this opening, the coauthors take a close look at the history and development of these texts and explore their position in media. We then explore the potential for Ross’s work in the literacy classroom through lesson plans, descriptions, and personal explorations of the books, particularly in relationship to the range of making practices that are made available in comics. This final section is part of what unites our common interest in Ross’s work as coauthors, as we are aligned in our appreciation of sequential art as a medium in itself, but also both identify as long-time readers of comics who attribute at least part of our literacy development to the comics form. What is more, we have both used comics in the middle grades classroom and can point to their textual efficacy and power in capturing the interest of young readers. © 2023 Taylor and Francis."
"Translation, or more precisely translation studies, constitutes a very important topic nowadays and on which different theories continue to be thrown depending on the way of treatment and the importance given to the special aspects related to the translation process. Despite ongoing discussions, importance is attached to the fact that the translation should create an effect on the readers of the translated text as close as possible to that of the readers of the source text. This study aims to provide a detailed analysis based on the two versions translated into Albanian of the work The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway, namely by Ismail Kadare in 1963 and by Vedat Kokona in 1997. The methodology of this study analyzes the features and characteristics of the aspects especially the two translated versions of the original work, emphasizing the similarities as well as the changes that the translation methodology has undergone over the years. By comparing the two different periods, this study brings to light the possible transformations that take place in the translation process, as well as in this way determine the course that the translation took until a few years ago. This study allows us to observe if those features continue to be part of the translation process even today. This research consists of two linguistic corpora, one in English and one in Albanian, which makes possible the realization of this work. Due to the nature of this work, the corpus in English is the work in the original language ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway, as well as the Albanian language corpus, which constitutes the two versions of the translation of the work in the original language as well as scientific literature rich and contemporary in the service of elaborating this paper. © 2023 Lama et al."
"Sentiment analysis has turned out to be a pivotal technique for fetching insights from data in textual form, and the prominent method that has emerged is aspect-based sentiment analysis, i.e., the ABSA. ABSA follows a dissection of textural content in order to associate emotions with its distinct elements. This paper reveals the efficacy of the ABSA model while exploring the different methodologies for tackling the intricate scenarios of ABSA, majorly escalating its importance. Lying amid the spectrum of techniques, transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistillBERT have gained substantial traction in sentiment analysis, text extraction, and natural language processing (NLP). Numerous research endeavours have covered the most important of these transformer models to enhance ABSA performance. To successfully bridge this gap between theory and practice, we brought into consideration a hybrid BERT model, which was termed HyBERT. This model blends the strengths of BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. Using data from the comprehensive Hugging Face dataset, our study meticulously processes the shared information to identify traits related to ABSA. It represents an extensive evaluation of multiple models within the ABSA framework. Each model's performance has been scrutinised and benchmarked against other models. The assessment encompasses a spectrum of evaluation metrics, which include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, that provide a holistic view of performance. Our research aims to provide an important revelation: it reflects the remarkable advancement in ABSA performance, and the outcome reveals the importance of a hybrid transformer model that takes the approach beyond the depths of sentiment analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Today, every industry uses sentiment analysis as machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to evaluate client satisfaction with a given product or service. In our study, we investigated how combining voice sentiment analysis with text sentiment analysis influences outcomes compared to employing only one of the analysis methods for small size of data. In our experiments, we had 96% accuracy for the test data of the speech sentiment analysis model and 78% accuracy for the test data of the text sentiment analysis model. By dint of the Multimodal model methods, the combined use of the two models exceeded the sound test results and reached 98% accuracy. This shows the positive effect of the Multimodal model method on sentiment analysis performed with little data. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article presents an analysis of Swedish subject teachers and special educators’ discourses on the teaching of students with different needs in order to study their enactment of inclusive education in relation to competing demands. Drawing on notions of policy enactment, policies are here not only understood as regulatory texts, but also as carriers of discourses with certain ideas of what is common sense or true. In particular, the analysis aims to explore local school actors’ opportunities for resistance towards dominant standards policies that has been argued to constrain inclusive ambitions in schools by promoting competition and standardised goals of performance. Three discourses were discerned in the analysis: a standards discourse, a subject-teaching discourse, and a discourse of well-being, which are discussed in relation to each other and to the idea of inclusive education. While the standards discourse was dominant in the interviews, the analysis also shows how the interviewed teachers and special educators moved between different discourses, which provided some opportunities to challenge standards thinking. However, such resistance was not necessarily connected to a movement towards inclusion. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The article shows that the personality of Peter I occupies an important place in the structure of public thought, but often receives conflicting assessments. The task of the study was to study the image of the emperor in the minds of our contemporaries. The search was implemented by referring to the texts of messages about Peter I in social networks. In the course of the study, frequency, morphological and emotional analysis of texts was carried out. Along with the evaluation of the emotional, psychological and personal characteristics of the emperor, the authors carried out a meaningful analysis of the psychological characteristics of the attitude of users to the historical situation as a whole, which allows not only to describe the personal characteristics of the emperor, but also to demonstrate their place in the overall structure of assessments of his activities. The obtained results showed a respectful attitude of users to the achievements of the emperor with a pronounced emotional disagreement with the palette of some of his worldview beliefs. As private conclusions, it is shown that the interest of contemporaries (users of social networks) in the image of Peter I is more concentrated on progressive changes at the state level. The psychological image of Peter I is represented by detailed assessments. The main psychological features of the emperor are summarized in the minds of users into two enlarged subgroups — individual psychological and organizational and managerial. An analysis of the emotional background of the messages showed that when assessing the life of the emperor, a neutral background prevails, which may be due to the historical distance between eras. As prospects, the authors indicate methodological and applied areas of research that require additional research attention. © 2023, Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

"This chapter discusses the expression of bias in news headlines as a possible vehicle for the codification of partial truths, tainted truths, or untruths, either as forms of involuntary misinformation or conscious disinformation. Headlines, in fact, are resources meant to point to the content of the ensuing news article in a way that is concise and appealing. As such, they are important textual resources, in that they provide cues concerning the content (performing an informative function) and the angle through which the content is going to be construed (carrying out a framing function), and they also, very commonly, contain attractors (unexpected and impactful formulations) to stimulate the readers’ interest and encourage them to read the associated text it in full. At the same time, due to the distinctive brevity of the genre, which requires processes of content simplification (namely, through deletion, distortion, and generalisation), headlines are also important resources for conveying forms of bias. In fact, the operation of word choice and content simplification is likely to favour given understandings over others, by prioritising and conferring interpretive relevance to specific elements of information, thus potentially contributing to positing or reinforcing specific worldviews, and concealing concurrent ones. On this basis, this analysis investigates the ways in which bias may be codified in the formulation of headlines in US media outlets when reporting specific current affairs. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"Objective: This study aimed to explore the main reasons for hearing aid uptake from a user perspective and recommendations to others with hearing difficulties. Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Responses to a single open-ended question were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Study sample: Participants (n = 642) included adult hearing aid users sampled from the Hearing Tracker website community and Lexie Hearing user databases in the United States. Results: Participants had a mean age of 65.4 years (13.7 SD) and included 61.8% males, 37.7% females, 0.3% non-binary, and 0.2% preferred not to say. Reasons for hearing aid uptake were categorised into three domains (personal impact, social difficulties, and auditory difficulties), containing 11 main categories and 48 sub-categories. User recommendations to others with hearing difficulties constituted eight main categories (timely help, trial period, support, affordability, technology, direct-to-consumer hearing aids, adjustments, and advocacy) and 32 sub-categories. Conclusions: The decision to take up hearing aids included intrinsic factors like readiness to change and extrinsic factors such as the availability of finances. The most frequent recommendation to others was not to delay seeking hearing help and to get hearing aids. Our findings may support strategies to facilitate behaviour change for improved hearing aid uptake. © 2023 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society."
"Since the advent of wireless communication, the safe transmission of data from one point to another has been of prime significance and concern. As a result, many algorithms have been developed to encrypt the data being transmitted from the sender's side to avoid unauthorized access. Yet, cybercriminals tend to always find loopholes in algorithms and develop a way to bypass or crack encryption to obtain confidential data. Vigenère Cipher is among the oldest and best-known polyalphabetic ciphers, which uses polyalphabetic substitution with the help of a series of Caesar ciphers to encrypt data. Yet, attackers have found ways to crack the encryption by analyzing the frequency of letters and predicting the key. This paper introduces a new methodology to overcome frequency analysis using the transposition of plain text characters based on the value of the characters from the key being used to encrypt them. As a result, Kasiski and Friedman attacks are nullified on the encrypted text.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Deep Learning comes under Machine Learning that accomplishes more power and flexibility by learning to present different concepts or relations of real world to simpler concepts. We use Deep learning fundaments in this paper because it has massive amount of data that helps in innovations. We include these neural networks of deep learning because it comes with a high accuracy rate with lower computations. Natural Processing Language (NLP) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are the methods that individually contribute to the text generation method. Although these are two different technologies giving the output for some common motive where Text generation plays a very important role in smart translations and dialogue systems. This review paper presents a model centered around text generation. This is done because combinedly we want to present what can be different approaches to look at a model like this. To solve the problem of unnecessarily used large texts, unsatisfactory feedback, NLP is used for text generation, GANN is used for text generation model, image generation etc. Finally, this is done to reduce time complexities, speed, efficiency in process because this is noticed that learning for a problem plays a vital role in education to enhance features.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Metadiscourse markers have been observed to be frequently employed by simultaneous interpreters as interpreting strategies in the process of interpretation. However, the realm of inquiry into this phenomenon remains relatively underexplored. This study aims to rectify this gap by conducting a systematic analysis of metadiscourse features in the context of Chinese-English simultaneous interpreting. The analytical framework for this study is rooted in Hyland’s interpersonal model of metadiscourse. By comparing the frequency and distribution of various metadiscourse markers in the source language (Chinese), target language (English), and original English speeches in simultaneous interpreting events, the research seeks to offer a quantitative description, qualitative analysis, and explanation of the causes of these metadiscourse features. To facilitate this analysis, the authors have compiled a Chinese-English Simultaneous Interpreting Parallel Corpus and a Comparable Original English Corpus based on ten international economic conferences, totaling 161,068 tokens. The findings reveal significant differences in interlingual and intralingual comparisons. Professional interpreters demonstrate a strong awareness of metadiscourse by employing various “metadiscourse interpreting strategies,” including explicitation/simplification, emphasis/weakening, and visibility/invisibility. Moreover, interpreted English displays distinct metadiscourse features including explicitation of textual logic, objective modal tendency, and audience orientation, as compared to the original English speeches. The observed differences in the study can be attributed to a range of factors, including contextual factors, source language features, and the cognitive psychology of the interpreter. This study provides an in-depth analysis of metadiscourse characteristics in Chinese-English simultaneous interpreting, contributing to fine-grained inquiries into our understanding of the linguistic features of interpreted texts within the context of corpus-based interpreting studies.

"Some animals and plants injure or kill millions of people annually, others cause trillions of dollars in property damage and loss. Such harmful species are understandably hated. However, the vast majority of the planet’s millions of species are disliked simply because of how they look and act. This bias is endangering numerous species that play important roles in maintaining both the natural ecosystems and the human economies of the world. In Defense of the World’s Most Despised Species examines the psychological motivations that lead people to make judgments about the attractiveness of species, noting the overwhelming importance of visual cues. It describes in considerable detail the physical and behavioral traits of species that lead us to love or hate them. Full color illustrations throughout present beautiful, charming animals and plants, species that seem loathsome, behavior of people in relation to such divergent species and their characteristics, and numerous explanatory diagrams of relevant biological and psychological phenomena. The aim of this book is to give readers insights into how we humans arrive at biased judgments and to promote the welfare of valuable, albeit sometimes unlovable animals and plants that consequently suffer from discrimination. Many of the ugliest, most disgusting, and feared species, such as vultures, toads, hyenas, sharks, spiders, and even the vast majority of cockroaches, in reality are some of our most valuable friends. Features • Theme of the book - human preferences for and against species - is novel, scarcely examined to date • Multidisciplinary analysis, especially psychology, biological conservation science, and ecology, as well as philosophy, agriculture, urban planning, human health, and law • Text is accessible, user-friendly, concise, and well-organized, making numerous complex topics comprehensible, readable not only by specialists, but also by students and the educated layperson • Includes over 2,000 high-quality, entertaining, and informative color figures. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"The recent progress in text-based audio retrieval was largely propelled by the release of suitable datasets. Since the manual creation of such datasets is a laborious task, obtaining data from online resources can be a cheap solution to create large-scale datasets. We study the recently proposed SoundDesc benchmark dataset, which was automatically sourced from the BBC Sound Effects web page. In our analysis, we find that SoundDesc contains several duplicates that cause leakage of training data to the evaluation data. This data leakage ultimately leads to overly optimistic retrieval performance estimates in previous benchmarks. We propose new training, validation, and testing splits for the dataset that we make available online. To avoid weak contamination of the test data, we pool audio files that share similar recording setups. In our experiments, we find that the new splits serve as a more challenging benchmark. © 2023 IEEE."
"Part I of this chapter analyses Silvestro Ganassi’s 1535 recorder treatise, La Fontegara, not only as a repository of performance knowledge but also as a performance of knowledge in itself. It begins with a short biographical contextualisation situating the author and his work within the social context of the Venetian Republic, and the epistemic debates surrounding the liberalisation of the fine arts. It then leads to a close reading of the text framed by Michel Foucault’s work on early modern knowledge production. The aim is to forward an understanding of historical music treatises as prefigurations of contemporary practice-based artistic research. In Part II, the focus turns to the role of imitation in Ganassi’s work. Imitation exists as a result of a translation of the object to be imitated, of its re-codification, whether by means of words, images or sounds. Ganassi, a painter-musician, in his Fontegara, compares an instrument’s capacity of imitating words to a painter’s ability to imitate the colours of nature, by forming a parallel between instrumental music and painting. The introduction of certain notions of translatability and transposition between the arts was a common issue in the Renaissance, after da Vinci’s famous paragon. A broader understanding of the painting-related vocabulary Ganassi applied to detail recorder technique proposes new paradigms of interdisciplinary research that may not only contribute to the construction of the identity of mimetic arts per se, but also to the framing of our historical imagination. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, John Koslovsky and Michiel Schuijer; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Transformer-based BERT Models can show great accuracy and success performance in sentiment analysis. However, these models also face some problems. Within the scope of this study, the problem of data drift in sentiment analysis is specifically examined. Data drift is caused by the fact that training data and test data having different properties. Within the scope of the study, new datasets consisting of Tweets and literary texts were created and the performances of different Bert models in these new datasets is examined. A BERT model trained on educational tweets has been shown to underperform on political/commercial tweets. It has been shown that the same BERT model trained on educational tweets can perform on literary texts just as well as a random model. For better results, we recommend using a combination of industry/domain specific small imitative BERT models. © 2023 IEEE."
"How to solve the data scarcity problem for end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST)? It's well known that data augmentation is an efficient method to improve performance for many tasks by enlarging the dataset. In this paper, we propose Mix at three levels for Speech Translation (M3ST) method to increase the diversity of the augmented training corpus. Specifically, we conduct two phases of fine-tuning based on a pre-trained model using external machine translation (MT) data. In the first stage of fine-tuning, we mix the training corpus at three levels, including word level, sentence level and frame level, and fine-tune the entire model with mixed data. At the second stage of fine-tuning, we take both original speech sequences and original text sequences in parallel into the model to fine-tune the network, and use Jensen-Shannon divergence to regularize their outputs. Experiments on MuST-C speech translation benchmark and analysis show M3ST outperforms current strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on eight directions with an average BLEU of 29.9. © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Many children today are growing up in environments that predispose them to develop noncommunicable diseases. While no single preventive solution exists, evidence supports interventions in childcare settings for establishing good nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a “critical window” that could reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases later in life. Emerging eHealth tools have shown potential in promoting best practices for nutrition and physical activity environments in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings. Objective: The primary objective of this review is to map the breadth of available evidence on eHealth tools currently available to assess and support best practices for nutrition, physical activity, or both in ECEC settings and to highlight potential research directions. Methods: This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Scoping Reviews with adherence to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist guidelines. Eligibility is based on the Population, Concept, and Context criteria as follows: (1) early childhood educators (population); (2) eHealth (digital) technology, such as websites, smartphone apps, email, and social media (concept); and (3) measurement and intervention tools to support best practices for nutrition, physical activity, or both in ECEC settings (context). The information sources for this review are the bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, ERIC, and Embase in English and French with no date restrictions. Following this, a scan of gray literature will be undertaken. The electronic search strategy was developed in collaboration with two librarians. Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of all relevant publications against inclusion criteria, followed by a full-text review using a data extraction tool developed by the reviewers. A synthesis of included papers will describe the publication, assessment, and intervention tool details. A summary of the findings will describe the types of eHealth assessment tools available, psychometric properties, eHealth intervention components, and theoretical frameworks used for development. Results: Preliminary searches of bibliographic databases to test and calibrate the search were carried out in May 2023. Study selection based on titles and abstracts was started in August 2023. The developed search strategy will guide our search for gray literature. The findings will be presented in visualized data map format, waffle chart, or tabular format accompanied by a narrative discussion. The scoping review is planned for completion in 2024. Conclusions: A structured review of the literature will provide a summary of the range and type of eHealth tools available for ECEC programs to assess and improve nutrition environments, physical activity environments, or both in order to identify gaps in the current evidence base and provide insights to guide future intervention research. © Joyce Hayek, Katharine Elliott, Makayla Vermette, Lynne MZ Lafave."
"Large-scale group decision making in social media content analysis, empowered by Artificial Intelligence tools, offers valuable insights in management research. The purpose of this paper is to identify and interpret the knowledge maps that emerge in social media research, based on deep learning algorithms and neural networks' impact in social content analytics. We conducted qualitative research, by analysing relevant articles focused on the role played by deep learning and neural networks in social media content analysis. The key themes retrieved from the selected articles have been included in visual representations, provided by Nvivo12 software, considering its text-mining capabilities. We are aware that large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) offers solutions for research issues on social media content analysis. This qualitative research highlights the value of LSGDM skills for researchers that developed an AI platform prototype for social media content analysis. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Fake news and misinformation are a key topic when discussing social media analysis research. Special attention has been paid to how social media discourse, rather than focusing on the correct identification of sources and voices, can end up constructing trust and credibility by emphasising shared identities and positions, usually in opposition to other views. Studies on “echo chambers” look at how the views of others are systematically rejected and used instrumentally to support one’s own beliefs. Twitter discourse is often a case in point. The focus of our analysis is on the language that manifests the writer’s position, starting from the concept of engagement as defined in Martin and White’s (2005) appraisal framework. This indicates the speaker’s degree of commitment to what is being expressed and manifests the speaker’s attitudes to opening and closing the dialogic space for external views. Using a corpus of tweets and one of journalistic texts on the pandemic, we test the hypothesis that the space given to dialogic contraction on Twitter may be wider than that provided by traditional journalism. The study - based on frequency analysis, concordance analysis, and word embedding - centres on a predefined list of appraisal markers indicating contraction or expansion. We look at the relative frequency of these markers and at their role in the ongoing debate. The results show that there are specific markers that dominate Twitter discourse: adversative “but”, negative “no”/“not”, and cognitive verbs like “know” and “think”. A closer analysis of concordances of negatives and cognitive verbs shows that it is possible to identify patterns that are clear signals of explicit denials, whether in representing a position or rejecting it, and that the verbs are used as markers of ideological positioning. Twitter thus turns out to be characterised by positioning that emphasises contrasting views and denial of other positions. (302 words). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"This book offers a new edition of Henry Maydman’s work Naval Speculations with a detailed commentary by two leading experts on its importance to the naval issues of the 21st century. Written at a revolutionary and troubling time, Maydman’s 1691 book offers an analysis of the state of the Royal Navy at the time, together with a set of recommendations for its improvement. It not only tells us a good deal about the Royal Navy of the time but also provides a general theory of why navies decline and what can be done to rejuvenate them. Recovering Naval Power shows that the issues he identifies have applied to every navy in every period. We are now seeing the dramatic rejuvenation of the Chinese Navy and the reactions to it of the US and other navies, together with a new rise in naval tensions in the Euro-Atlantic. Despite the obvious political, economic and technological differences between Maydman’s day and ours, this work shows that his recommendations could hardly be more relevant in today’s circumstances. Alongside the modified text of Naval Speculations, this book includes a preface and two chapters addressing, first, the Royal Navy of Maydman's time and his role in it and, second, the relevance of what Maydman said for the navies of the 21st century. The book concludes with some overall comments about Maydman and the recovery of naval power and recommendations for further reading. This book will be of much interest to students of naval history, maritime power, strategic studies, and International Relations in general. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, John B.

"With the widespread availability of multiple data sources, such as image, audio-video, and text data, automatic summarization of multimodal data is becoming an important technology in decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and summary of the main articles in the field of multimodal summarization techniques in recent years. Firstly, we define multimodal summarization and briefly describe the development process. Then, we survey existing techniques and their applicability in different domains. Additionally, we provide an analysis of their results and discuss the insights of those approaches, along with the challenges and future research directions. Based on our study, we found that the encoder-decoder approach is currently the best approach for automated summarization. In the future, we believe that the applications of multimodal summarization could develop rapidly in many different fields, particularly in medicine. In our case studies, we demonstrate that multimodal learning is a promising research direction for providing timely and accurate summarizations compared to unimodal approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The field of clinical medicine involves complex data analysis and mining, and text classification task in natural language processing can assist in case screening, etiology analysis, disease prediction, and other aspects in the medical field, thereby improving research efficiency and accuracy. However, obtaining supervised data is difficult due to the fact that medical texts such as cases often contain sensitive patient information. This difficulty partially explains why existing text classification methods do not perform well in medical tasks. Although the prompt tuning performs better than traditional neural networks and fine tuning methods in few-shot learning and interpretability. Chinese requires at least two characters to express complex semantics, which makes it challenging to apply the prompt tuning method that is primarily designed for English in Chinese text classification tasks. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Enhanced Multi-Token Prompt Tuning (KMPT). KMPT first uses multiple tokens as label words to have complete Chinese semantics, and then uses external knowledge to expand the label words set, improving coverage and reducing bias. The experimental results on the Chinese medical dataset CHIP-CTC show that KMPT outperforms baseline methods in Chinese medical text classification tasks and has better interpretability and convergence speed than fine tuning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This study offers a critical textual analysis of trans* representation in two popular Hindi web series Sacred Games (Luegenbiehl & Motwane (Executive Producers), 2018–2019, Sacred Games [TV series]) and Paatal Lok (Sharma et al. (Executive Producers), 2020–Present, Paatal Lok [TV series]). We probe how trans* representations function to maintain normative agendas in a heteropatriarchal nation-state. Further, we examine their potential to reify dominant stereotypes in popular media. Our analysis reveals discourses surrounding hegemonic heterosexuality (Yep, 2003, Journal of Homosexuality, 45(2–4), 11–59), transnormativisation (Puar, 2015, Social Text, 33(3 (124)), 45–73) and homohindunationalism (Upadhyay, 2020, Interventions, 22(4), 464–480) based on two trans* characters—Kukkoo and Cheeni. We argue that the characters are conceptualised through a cis-heteropatriarchal imagination in a right-wing nation-state achieved through gendered and racialised othering. We uncover several mediated failures. First, how persistent male gaze functions to centre cis-heteronormative tropes that marginalise trans*ness and the trans* characters. Second, the dual pressures of Puar’s theorisation of ‘passing’ and ‘piecing’ create normativised trans* bodies that are unable to break out of the gender binary. Lastly, we argue that the Hindu-nationalist state works to co-opt and nullify progressive portrayals of trans* characters through its legal and biopolitical machinery. © 2023 MICA-The School of Ideas."
"This paper constitutes an empirical investigation into the diachrony of clitic climbing (and consequently restructuring) in French based on data from a novel corpus of legal texts, as well as a theoretical analysis of the loss of this phenomenon from the history of French. We show that clitic climbing was obligatory until the Middle French period, until its eventual loss before the start of the 19th century. Assuming that clitics are ϕ-heads that AGREE with v, we take restructuring to be monoclausal, despite apparent counterevidence where a subordinator or a Wh-item intervenes. We propose that restructuring is a necessary but not sufficient condition to clitic climbing, the latter depending on whether the upper v-head bears a set of unvalued ϕ-features. We associate the loss of clitic climbing to the loss of interpolation (i.e. the order [clitic-XP-V]), as we show that both constructions are available when cliticisation is a phonological mechanism only. In Modern French however, clitics are necessarily proclitic and verb-adjacent which indicates that cliticisation is syntactic. Lastly, we propose that French never lost restructuring, but instead it lost most transparency effects associated with it (such as clitic climbing), while retaining others (such as long passives and quantifier climbing). © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Digital entrepreneurship is often positioned as a way for women to “have it all.” This is exemplified in the rise of multilevel marketing companies (MLMs) that rely heavily on the Internet to recruit and sell and are often targeted toward women. However, MLMs are often derided as pyramid schemes. This qualitative study aimed to examine how MLMs leverage their websites to rhetorically frame MLMs as legitimate operations. Through the examination and analysis of the visuals and texts of 10 different MLM corporate websites from 2019 to 2022, our results reveal that MLM corporate websites use gendered framing and appeal to entrepreneurism as an important component of their legitimation discourse. Using Van Leeuwen’s legitimation strategies as a framework, we identified six key themes at work in the MLM legitimation rhetoric. © 2023 (Heidi E. Huntington and Mary E. Brooks).

"Aim: Female sex workers (FSWs) are particularly susceptible to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) problems due to their occupation. Given that their health needs are often ignored, a review was undertaken to identify the nature, factors, and experiences associated with health-seeking behavior of FSWs worldwide. Subject and methods: We searched four electronic databases (EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Pubmed, and Scopus), along with a manual search in Google Scholar and the citations from retrieved articles on health-seeking behavior of female sex workers. Articles that were peer-reviewed, presented in full-text, written in English language, and published between August 2012 and July 2022, were considered for this study. The review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The database and manual search yielded 334 studies. Seventeen papers that met our inclusion criteria were included in our review. Our qualitative synthesis resulted in five themes: sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues, lack of access and awareness, social stigma, non-SRH matters, and drugs, violence, and abuse. Conclusion: Findings of this review demonstrated that the FSWs faced challenges seeking both SRH and general health needs. They were often victims of social stigma and violence. A number of socioeconomic and cultural factors shaped their experience with regard to healthcare access. Special attention is needed to promote awareness and access to safe healthcare services for FSWs in the future to improve their situation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Farm work is one of the nation's most hazardous occupations, and migrant and seasonal farmworkers face significant health inequities. Awareness and understanding of the needs of this population are crucial in assuring they receive appropriate support. Documentary programs can raise awareness of community member views to better inform services and advocacy efforts. Visions for the future of farm work were collected from farmworkers and persons supporting them through a community-based, participatory documentary project led by Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) from 2021 to 2022. Seventy-nine submissions from participants in North and South Carolina, including text responses and file uploads, were collected and thematically analyzed. Five themes were identified: (1) employment benefits and conditions, (2) living conditions, (3) health access and quality, (4) dignity and visibility of farm work, and (5) policy change for a better future. The visions for the future of farm work expressed by these agricultural workers, advocates, and students raise important implications for agricultural communities, public health practitioners, researchers, funders, and policymakers. Application of these findings in the development and delivery of public health services for farmworkers has the potential to positively impact the morbidity and mortality rates of this at-risk population. © 2023 The Authors.

"Purpose: This research aims to propose a model for the complex decision-making involved in the ecological restoration of mega-infrastructure (e.g. railway engineering). This model is based on multi-source heterogeneous data and will enable stakeholders to solve practical problems in decision-making processes and prevent delayed responses to the demand for ecological restoration. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the principle of complexity degradation, this research collects and brings together multi-source heterogeneous data, including meteorological station data, remote sensing image data, railway engineering ecological risk text data and ecological restoration text data. Further, this research establishes an ecological restoration plan library to form input feature vectors. Random forest is used for classification decisions. The ecological restoration technologies and restoration plant species suitable for different regions are generated. Findings: This research can effectively assist managers of mega-infrastructure projects in making ecological restoration decisions. The accuracy of the model reaches 0.83. Based on the natural environment and construction disturbances in different regions, this model can determine suitable types of trees, shrubs and herbs for planting, as well as the corresponding ecological restoration technologies needed. Practical implications: Managers should pay attention to the multiple types of data generated in different stages of megaproject and identify the internal relationships between these multi-source heterogeneous data, which provides a decision-making basis for complex management decisions. The coupling between ecological restoration technologies and restoration plant species is also an important factor in improving the efficiency of ecological compensation. Originality/value: Unlike previous studies, which have selected a typical section of a railway for specialized analysis, the complex decision-making model for ecological restoration proposed in this research has wider geographical applicability and can better meet the diverse ecological restoration needs of railway projects that span large regions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The article compares the theories of three architectural phenomenologists - Karsten Harries, dalibor Vesely and Alberto Pérez-Gómez - who are acclaimed by their coverage of architecture from ancient times to today. The starting point of the theories is the meaningful architecture of pre-modern times, which was replaced by an objectified concept of architecture after the crisis of the enlightenment. The authors under analysis define pre-modern architecture as a representation of an invisible layer of meaning, based mostly on the analysis of enlightenment texts, Husserl’s theory of the crisis of science and the phenomenological tradition. Two semantic structures are distinguished, related to exact meaning and sensory experience. The analysis of different historical epochs reveals the heterogeneity of meaningful pre-modern architecture. © 2023 Lithuanian Institute of Philosophy and Sociology. All rights reserved."
"Purpose: This study aims to focus on the legal status of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulatory spread in spite of its limited membership in international law. This is conducted by examining the regime of the FATF with the normative regime of public international law and trying to identify common grounds and conflicts between the two. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted an exploratory approach involving a thorough examination and analysis of accredited text, command papers and reports, archival materials, national obligations, websites as well as other documentary evidence. Findings: This research gives an empirical determinant of compliance behaviour in response to FATF regulatory standards and the interplay of international law. Research limitations/implications: The findings here are not exhaustive and could be approached from other perspectives. Researchers are therefore encouraged to engage by testing the findings further, as this is only a blueprint for further research. Practical implications: This study provides implications for the need to open up the current membership of the FATF, as it appears discriminatory in nature and could inhibit effective compliance with its regulatory standards. Social implications: FATF regulatory standards do not just revolve around its members and rule-takers but also affect unintended and vulnerable people who were never in contemplation when these regulations were debated without a global consensus. Originality/value: The main aim of this study is to advocate for a rethink of FATF’s regulatory strategy by ensuring that its operations are more inclusive, where jurisdictions can participate as members, creating a sense of belonging and commitment in the fight against money laundering. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a young party that has been governing the city-state of Delhi since 2015, has placed (i) the fight against corruption; (ii) the development of participatory democracy; and (iii) good governance at the center of its agenda. The official discourse of the party, in its formative years, promoted participation through a major promise: if voted to power, it would govern with the people. This paper investigates the meanings and forms taken by this promise over the years. On the basis of (i) a textual analysis of the party’s “political text and talk” (manifestoes, speeches, interviews) and (ii) the observation of various participatory practices that it implemented over the years, the paper examines the AAP’s changing approach to participation. It focuses on the evolving technological infrastructures of these participatory experiments and shows that even as the dominant definition of participation evolved from “discussion” to “surveillance,” increasing reliance on high-tech, digital tools has meant that citizen participation, which was initially essential to its program, has become in the end nothing more than a means of political communication. © 2023 OpenEditions Journals.

"Multimodal speech emotion recognition aims to detect speakers' emotions from audio and text. Prior works mainly focus on exploiting advanced networks to model and fuse different modality information to facilitate performance, while neglecting the effect of different fusion strategies on emotion recognition. In this work, we consider a simple yet important problem: how to fuse audio and text modality information is more helpful for this multimodal task. Further, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition model improved by perspective loss. Empirical results show our method obtained new state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP dataset. The in-depth analysis explains why the improved model can achieve improvements and outperforms baselines. © 2023 IEEE."
"This chapter elucidates how COVID-19 has affected the everyday lives of children and young people with physical impairments. The chapter challenges one-sided accounts of the pandemic as an inequality-reinforcing event and presents a more ambivalent, surprising, and potentially transformative picture. While a social crisis such as a pandemic is often conceived as a temporary condition demonstrating a sense of loss of balance and control, such a disordered state of being is ‘the normal’ rather than an exception for many disabled children and young people. The analysis reveals how the pandemic has opened new opportunities and ways of participation and inclusion while at the same time not radically altering the everyday lives of disabled children and young people, as social isolation is already a part of their lives as a result of both disablist barriers and impairment effects. The chapter discusses how such insights can form a basis for improving the lived citizenship of disabled children and youth. The analysis is based on empirical contributions from 19 children and young people, including interviews and written texts. Theoretically, the chapter draws on concepts from the literature on lived citizenship and the social-relational model of disability. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Nicole Thualagant and Pelle Korsbæk Sørensen and Troels Sune Mønsted; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Self-organizing Map (SOM) is one of the artificial neural networks and well applied to datamining or feature visualization of high-dimensional datasets. Recently, SOMs are actively used for market research, political decision-making, and social analysis using a huge number of live text-data. The SOM, however, needs a large number of parameters and iterative calculations like Deep Learning, so that specialized accelerators for SOM are strongly required. In this paper, we newly propose a scalable SOM accelerator based on FPGA, in which all neurons in the SOM are mapped onto an internal memory, or BRAM (Block-RAM) in FPGA to maintain high parallelism in the SOM itself. We implement the proposed SOM accelerator on an Alveo U50 (Xilinx, Ltd.) and evaluate its performance: the accelerator shows high scalability and runs 102.0 times faster than software processing with Intel Core i7, which is expected to be enough for the real-time datamining and feature visualization. © 2023, International Society of Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB)."
"Purpose: Informal housing stands out as a major challenge surrounding the massive reconstruction of Syrian cities, devastated by a bloody war and a terrible earthquake. The purpose of this article is to assess the adequacy of the Syrian Law to adequate provide a solution to this problem. Design/methodology/approach: With the purpose of informing the question, this paper offers a legal-institutional analysis of the informal housing phenomenon and the corresponding regulatory responses in Syria. A literature review is conducted, and functional analysis of the legal texts and their effective implementation is provided. Findings: First, informal housing in Syria has been fostered by the existence of an erratic regulation, particularly burdened by the incoherence of passing repressive provisions against informal housing while master plans were conspicuously absent or incomplete. Second, the regulatory policy seems to be leaning toward the urban renewal option, indicating a supply-oriented housing approach that may face serious challenges due to the scarcity of capital. In this context, regulation should not underestimate any policy tools at hand (renewal and upgrading; with the contribution of public, private and cooperative sectors). Originality/value: Although there have been several studies on informal housing in Syria, none has taken a legal institutionalist approach. Furthermore, this study offers an up-to-date account of the problem, taking into account the problematic after the 2023 earthquake and the content of Law 2/2023. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In a rapidly changing information landscape, science communicators need to find new ways to engage audiences, make their information memorable and increase attitudes towards scientists. Evidence suggests that stories could be an effective tool for these goals, but few studies tested experimentally whether they are advantageous to non-stories in the context of science communication. The current study aimed to fill that gap. Participants fluent in German (n = 151) were randomly assigned to either read a scientific text written as a story or written in classic abstract format. It was hypothesized that participants reading the story would score higher on reading enjoyment, attention focus, emotional engagement, topic interest, perceived authenticity of the author, identification and information recall than participants reading the non-story. Results showed that participants who read a story felt a higher sense of connection towards the author, a subconstruct of authenticity, while other variables remained insignificant. Reasons why this study could only find limited proof for the effectiveness of stories in science communication and methodological implications for future research are discussed. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Narrative Fiction and Death: Dying Imagined offers a new perspective on the study of death in literature. It focuses on narrative fiction that conveys the experience of dying from the internal perspective of a dying protagonist. Writers from Victor Hugo in the early 1800s to Elif Shafak in the present day have imagined the unknowable final moments on the threshold to death. This literary study examines the wide range of narrative strategies used to evoke the transition from life to death, and to what effect, revealing not only each writer’s unique way of representing the dying experience; the comparative reading also finds common concerns in these texts and uncovers surprising parallels and unexplored intertextual relations between works across time and space that will interest comparatists as well as specialists in the literatures discussed. Students of individual texts examined here will benefit from detailed analyses of these works. The fictional evocation of dying addresses our basic human fears, offering catharsis, consolation, and a greater cognitive and emotional understanding of that unknowable experience. Presented in an engaging and highly readable manner, this study argues for literature’s potential to challenge our assumptions about the end of life and change our approach to dying, an aspect that will interest students and researchers of the health humanities, palliative caregivers, and all those interested in questions of the end of life. © 2024 Sabine Köllmann."
"Purpose: The implementation of the Directive 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing resulted in the enactment by the Polish Parliament of the Act of March 1, 2018, on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. One of the most important issues identified in the Act was the establishment of the Central Register of Beneficial Owners. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyze the functioning of the Register in Poland from the perspective of three years since its establishment. The text presents the most important problems faced by reporting institutions and obliged entities due to discrepancies in the interpretation of the Act’s provisions – especially in terms of the definition of a beneficial owner. Design/methodology/approach: The basic research approach was a comparative content analysis method. The objects of analysis included Polish Laws, Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (EU) 2015/849 and the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The theoretical legislative assumptions contained in the Acts were compared with reports, studies and communications prepared by public and private institutions. This made it possible to draw conclusions regarding the causes of problems with the functioning of the Register in Poland. Findings: The results of the research showed that the ambiguity of the definition of the beneficial owner leads to a number of problems on the part of reporting institutions, such as companies, foundations and associations. On the other hand, a large part of the data entered in the Register is questioned by obliged entities. The lack of personal data protection is also a problem. Consequently, this reduces the value of the Register as a tool that effectively mitigates the risk of money laundering. Research limitations/implications: The research focused only on the functioning of the Central Register of Beneficial Owners in Poland. The subject of the analysis addressed problems with the definition of beneficial owner, issues of data quality and openness and the process of verifying the Register’s data. The technical aspects of the Register operation and the financial penalties imposed by public oversight institutions were not reviewed. Also, no comparison was made with other European Union (EU) member states that have implemented Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2015/849. Originality/value: This study discusses the important issue of regulatory requirements introduced under EU regulations for private companies. Familiarization of companies, NGOs and obliged entities with the conclusions of the study can positively influence the consolidation of the correct interpretative path. In addition, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first scientific text that identifies and systematizes the most important problems of the Register’s functioning in Poland. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Language and communication impairments are considered one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Quantifying the language atypicalities in autism is a challenging task. Prior works have explored acoustic, and text-based features to assess children's language and communicative behaviours and have shown their relevance in the diagnosis of autism. In this work, we explore the semantic and pragmatic language features in children with autism (CwA) to understand their significance in the diagnosis of autism. We use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to automatically extract relevant features and detect the existence of speech behaviours such as echolalia, semantic coherence, repetitive language, etc. We further analyse their correlation with the clinical diagnosis of autism. We conducted validation experiments on the transcripts of 76 children (35 ASD and 41 TD) extracted from the CHILDES databank. Our analysis shows that the semantic and pragmatic language features are representative candidates for autism diagnosis and are found to complement the syntactic and lexical features in the classification of CwA with an accuracy of 94%. Further, these features being more coherent and relatable to the standard diagnostic tools improves the interpretability of the diagnostic predictions made using speech signals. © 2023 IEEE."
"Image captioning is known as a fundamental computer vision task aiming to figure out and describe what is happening in an image or image region. Through an image captioning process, it is ensured to describe and define the actions and the relations of the objects within the images. In this manner, the contents of the images can be understood and interpreted automatically by visual computing systems. In this paper, we proposed the TRCaptionNet a novel deep learning-based Turkish image captioning (TIC) model for the automatic generation of Turkish captions. The model we propose essentially consists of a basic image encoder, a feature projection module based on vision transformers, and a text decoder. In the first stage, the system encodes the input images via the CLIP (contrastive language–image pretraining) image encoder. The CLIP image features are then passed through a vision transformer and the final image features to be linked with the textual features are obtained. In the last stage, a deep text decoder exploiting a BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) based model is used to generate the image cations. Furthermore, unlike the related works, a natural language-based linguistic model called NLLB (No Language Left Behind) was employed to produce Turkish captions from the original English captions. Extensive performance evaluation studies were carried out and widely known image captioning quantification metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr were measured for the proposed model. Within the scope of the experiments, quite successful results were observed on MS COCO and Flickr30K datasets, two known and prominent datasets in this field. As a result of the comparative performance analysis by taking the existing reports in the current literature on TIC into consideration, it was witnessed that the proposed model has superior performance and outperforms the related works on TIC so far.

"This chapter explores online anti-LGBTIQ+ discourses and the resulting claim that sexual diversity runs counter to most mainstream, traditional, or religious values. Such narratives feed into the theory underlying an alleged disinformation crusade enacted across most social networking sites (see Balirano & Hughes 2020), whereby a secret, large-scale gay lobby, akin to the proverbial Trojan horse, is progressively infiltrating traditional family values with an aim to defile the entire human race. By investigating a corpus of online conspiracy-evoking texts collected from Twitter, this study offers a corpus-based social-media critical discourse approach to online fake news that serves to cast a conspiratorial shadow upon LGBTIQ+ communities. We posit that such dangerous anti-LGBTIQ+ discourses originating from manipulated news feeds and subsequently woven together across social networking sites may progressively lead to the construction of an LGBTIQ+ conspiracy theory wreaking damage upon a sorely tried minority. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

"Social media have long been recognized as a valuable proxy for investigating users' opinions by echoing virtual venues where individuals engage in daily discussions on a wide range of topics. Among them, climate change is gaining momentum due to its large-scale impact, tangible consequences for society, and enduring nature. In this work, we investigate the social debate surrounding climate emergency, with particular emphasis on the Conference of the Parties (COP), the foremost global forum for multilateral discussion on climate-related matters. To this aim, we leverage graph mining and text mining techniques to analyze a large corpus of tweets spanning 7 years, aiming to uncover the fundamental patterns underlying the climate debate, thus providing valuable support for strategic and operational decision-making. Our contribution in this work is manifold: (i) we provide insights into the key social actors involved in the climate debate and their relationships, (ii) we unveil the main topics discussed during COPs within the social landscape, (iii) we assess the evolution of users' sentiment and emotions across time. Furthermore, our proposed approach has the potential to scale up to other emergency issues, highlighting its versatility and potential for broader use in analyzing the increasingly debated emergent phenomena.  © 2023 IEEE."

"The application of linguistic knowledge derived from pre-trained language models has demonstrated considerable potential in text classification tasks. Despite this, effectively learning the distance between samples and different labels for supervised learning tasks remains a practical challenge. In this study, we propose a novel approach, termed Parallel Networks with Pre-trained Models (ParaNet), which learns distance information between input samples and different labels within the same space. Specifically, ParaNet utilizes a Parallel Networks network architecture comprising two distinct Transformer Encoders to extract sample features and label features separately. By fine-tuning the network parameters, ParaNet can achieve the closest possible distance between the sample and its corresponding label, while simultaneously achieving the farthest possible distance between the sample and a label that does not belong to it. To fully exploit label information, the model leverages the semantic knowledge of the pre-trained model by adding templates to the labels. Our experimental analysis of eight benchmark text classification datasets demonstrates that ParaNet significantly improves classification accuracy, with an average accuracy rate increase from 89.1% to 89.64%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Sentiment analysis aims to extract general information from texts and understand the opinion, attitude, or emotion of an individual or group of people towards a specific topic. Currently, a source of information used is the messages published on Twitter, which offer possibilities of great interest to evaluate the currents of opinion disseminated through this social network. However, the enormous volumes of text require tools capable of automatically processing these messages without losing reliability. This article describes a technique to address this problem. This technique uses a variant of a Bi-GRU, a recurrent neural network (RNN) that promises to highlight local and global contextual features of tweets to increase the accuracy of classifying opinions in that social network. Experiments show better performance in tweet analysis, improving accuracy, recall, f-score, and accuracy parameters than traditional techniques. Finally, we identify the advantages and limitations of the system for its application to research on “Pueblos Mágicos” tourism in Quintana Roo. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Background: Feeding intolerance (FI), frequently resulting from gastrointestinal immaturity, is prevalent among premature infants. Current practices are gradually prioritizing nonpharmacological treatments, such as massage or “Tui na,” considering the potential side effects of prolonged medication use. Pediatric Tui na, a specialized massage therapy based on traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely studied for treating FI in premature infants. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review specifically focusing on the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine–based pediatric Tui na for FI in premature infants has been published yet. Objective: This study aims to develop a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis for evaluating the safety and efficacy of pediatric Tui na for premature infants with FI. Methods: We will perform a comprehensive search in the following databases: Springer, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, Clarivate Analytics, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Chinese biomedical databases (Wanfang database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Databases), limited to studies published in Chinese and English languages between January 2000 and January 2023. The search strategy will use MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and database-specific keywords. A total of 2 independent reviewers will initially screen the studies based on titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text evaluation of the eligible studies. Studies will include any nonrandomized controlled trials, nonrandomized clinical studies, randomized controlled trials, and quasi-experimental studies wherein the treatment group involves premature infants with FI given pediatric Tui na. Primary outcomes will be necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric residual volume, emesis, and stool blood. Secondary outcomes will be abdominal distension weight gain, time to achieve full enteral feeding, any adverse effects associated with pediatric Tui na, and length of hospital stay. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess the risk of bias and methodological quality. Funnel plots will be used for evaluating publication bias. Meta-analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.4; Cochrane Collaboration). Subgroup analyses will be considered according to treatment received, country or setting, sex, and birth weight of premature infants (if heterogeneity is high, I2≥50%). Results: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol, so the results are not yet available. The protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023390021). We are currently in the study selection phase. Results are expected to be completed by the end of 2023. Conclusions: Following this protocol, a comprehensive and rigorous literature synthesis will be developed to assess the impact of pediatric Tui na treatment on premature infants with FI, enabling the determination of its efficacy and safety. ©Zirong Bai, Xiaoxiao Lyu, Yichuan Tang, Meng Wang."
"Disease diagnosis plays an important role in the application of clinical decision system. When applying artificial intelligence models in disease diagnosis, one should be aware of the spurious correlations learned from the data. Such correlations could be introduced by the biased distribution of the data and would be reinforced during the optimization process. The spurious correlations will cause the model ultra-sensitive to some trivial variations in the input, and even introduce some significant errors when applied in non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data with the training data. In this paper, we addressed this problem by applying the global balancing method to adjust the distribution balance in the learned representation space of the text via the assignment of global sample weights. By learning the global sample weights that minimized the balance loss, the text representation space had been iteratively optimized by attenuating the strength of the spurious correlations introduced by the training data. Our algorithm, TCGBR (Text Classification with the Global Balance Regularizer), showed the reduced sensitivity to the trivial variations of the input text and increased diagnosis accuracy when tested on the non-i.i.d data. Furthermore, we built the causal graph to investigate the causal relationships in established diagnostic models and found the diagnostic logic of TCGBR was more in line with the clinical common sense. The presented architecture can be used by practitioners to improve the stability of diagnostic models and the technique of global balancing can be naturally generalized to other representation-based deep learning models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Image-text sentiment analysis aims to mine the emotional semantics conveyed by image and text information. Psychological research shows that the conveyed sentiment depends on the long-range correlation and interaction of sentiment contextual features within and between the modalities of text and image. However, most of the previous works use the feature stitching strategy based on gating and attention mechanism to fuse image-text data, and do not fully exploit the relationship within and between modalities. In this paper, we propose a cross-modality fused graph convolutional network for image-text sentiment classification. The proposed network reasons on intra-modal and inter-modal graphs to realizes the fusion between text and image. In addition, the huge intra class variability of multimodal data affects the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Therefore, we design a sample sentiment similarity loss function to help the model learn sentiment-related similar features from image and text data. Extensive experiments on image-text sentiment datasets show that the proposed network outperforms the existing sentiment analysis models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Economic growth is a crucial indicator for any country's economy. Tourism plays a vital role in the national economy of Indonesia with its multiplier effect, influencing the development of other sectors. Aspect-based sentiment analysis has emerged as a popular approach for understanding the opinions of tourist reviews. However, most aspect-identification algorithms are based on sentence dependencies, which are computationally expensive for longer texts. Therefore, in this paper, we studied Local Sentiment Aggregation (LSA) as an efficient method to extract aspects and classify sentiment polarities of these aspects. LSA introduces aggregation window-based sentiment learning (AW), a mechanism based on embeddings for neighbouring words. The results of our research demonstrate that the LSA model performs well on tourism reviews, as shown by the model's accuracy, which reached 92.48% and an F1 score of 87.40%. copy; 2023 IEEE. © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: As emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) increase, examining the underlying social and environmental conditions that drive EIDs is urgently needed. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is increasingly employed to predict disease emergence based on the spatial distribution of biotic conditions and interactions, abiotic conditions, and the mobility or dispersal of vector-host species, as well as social factors that modify the host species’ spatial distribution. Still, ENM applied to EIDs is relatively new with varying algorithms and data types. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021251968) with the research question: What is the state of the science and practice of estimating ecological niches via ENM to predict the emergence and spread of vector-borne and/or zoonotic diseases? Methods: We searched five research databases and eight widely recognized One Health journals between 1995 and 2020. We screened 383 articles at the abstract level (included if study involved vector-borne or zoonotic disease and applied ENM) and 237 articles at the full-text level (included if study described ENM features and modeling processes). Our objectives were to: (1) describe the growth and distribution of studies across the types of infectious diseases, scientific fields, and geographic regions; (2) evaluate the likely effectiveness of the studies to represent ecological niches based on the biotic, abiotic, and mobility framework; (3) explain some potential pitfalls of ENM algorithms and techniques; and (4) provide specific recommendation for future studies on the analysis of ecological niches to predict EIDs. Results: We show that 99% of studies included mobility factors, 90% modeled abiotic factors with more than half in tropical climate zones, 54% modeled biotic conditions and interactions. Of the 121 studies, 7% include only biotic and mobility factors, 45% include only abiotic and mobility factors, and 45% fully integrated the biotic, abiotic, and mobility data. Only 13% of studies included modifying social factors such as land use. A majority of studies (77%) used well-recognized ENM algorithms (MaxEnt and GARP) and model selection procedures. Most studies (90%) reported model validation procedures, but only 7% reported uncertainty analysis. Discussion: Our findings bolster ENM to predict EIDs that can help inform the prevention of outbreaks and future epidemics.

"Abstract:Objective: To summarize the breadth and quality of evidence supporting commonly recommended early childhood autism interventions and their estimated effects on developmental outcomes. Design: Updated systematic review and meta-analysis (autism intervention meta-analysis; Project AIM). Data sources: A search was conducted in November 2021 (updating a search done in November 2017) of the following databases and registers: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with full text, Education Source, Educational Administration Abstracts, ERIC, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX with full text, Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Any controlled group study testing the effects of any non-pharmacological intervention on any outcome in young autistic children younger than 8 years. Review methods: Newly identified studies were integrated into the previous dataset and were coded for participant, intervention, and outcome characteristics. Interventions were categorized by type of approach (such as behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and technology based), and outcomes were categorized by domain (such as social communication, adaptive behavior, play, and language). Risks of bias were evaluated following guidance from Cochrane. Effects were estimated for all intervention and outcome types with sufficient contributing data, stratified by risk of bias, using robust variance estimation to account for intercorrelation of effects within studies and subgroups. Results: The search yielded 289 reports of 252 studies, representing 13 304 participants and effects for 3291 outcomes. When contributing effects were restricted to those from randomized controlled trials, significant summary effects were estimated for behavioral interventions on social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (Hedges' g=0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.06; P=0.02), developmental interventions on social communication (0.28, 0.12 to 0.44; P=0.003); naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on adaptive behavior (0.23, 0.02 to 0.43; P=0.03), language (0.16, 0.01 to 0.31; P=0.04), play (0.19, 0.02 to 0.36; P=0.03), social communication (0.35, 0.23 to 0.47; P<0.001), and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.38, 0.17 to 0.59; P=0.002); and technology based interventions on social communication (0.33, 0.02 to 0.64; P=0.04) and social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (0.57, 0.04 to 1.09; P=0.04). When effects were further restricted to exclude caregiver or teacher report outcomes, significant effects were estimated only for developmental interventions on social communication (0.31, 0.13 to 0.49; P=0.003) and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on social communication (0.36, 0.23 to 0.49; P<0.001) and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.44, 0.20 to 0.68; P=0.002). When effects were then restricted to exclude those at high risk of detection bias, only one significant summary effect was estimated - naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.30, 0.03 to 0.57; P=0.03). Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common. Conclusion: The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication. However, potential benefits of these interventions cannot be weighed against the potential for adverse effects owing to inadequate monitoring and reporting.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

"Sarcasm has become quite inter-related with the day to day life of all. In news robust sarcasm is often used to grab the attention of the viewers. This research aims to detect sarcasm using Evidential deep learning. This technique uses uncertainty estimations for identifying the sentiments from news headlines dataset. Also, LSTM and GRU have been used with Evidential deep learning approach. The purpose of using LSTM is that it can classify texts from headlines in order to analysis the sentiments. Moreover, we have used GRU which is an recurrent neural networks (RNN) and it effectively models sequential data. The architecture of the GRU network is ideally suited for identifying dependencies and extended contextual relationships within news headings. Overall, our proposed model uses Evidential deep learning based LSTM and GRU to identify the sentiments of robust sarcasms from news headlines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"In this paper, we investigate the knowledge distillation strategy for training a compact student model for scene text detection, using a cumbersome teacher model that is too computational to apply on resource-constrained devices. We observed that the frequency domain information of the response map is different between the teacher and student models obviously, which can effectively guide the student model to learn more effective knowledge. Furtherly, we propose a wavelet knowledge distillation method via decoupled target for training accurate compact scene text detection networks. Specifically, we first use discrete wavelet transformation to decompose the probability map into different frequency bands which contain different characteristic components, transferring knowledge in the high-frequency band and low-frequency band respectively. In addition, we decouple the target to enhance the distillation effect of the corresponding region, by separating text and background regions through the ground truth mask. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves the F-measure of the student model and outperforms the other mainstream distillation methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This study examined whether creative thinking improves by utilizing an intervention program based on three types of ambiguous image-text interactions within artwork: (1) ambiguous text, (2) negation, and (3) semantically unrelated image-text. Participants (79) were divided into three groups: “ambiguous-negation-unrelated” group exposed to stimuli 1 + 2 + 3, “ambiguous-unrelated” group exposed to stimuli 1 + 3, and the control group unexposed to any intervention. The metaphor generation test (MGT) and Tel-Aviv creative test (TACT) were given pre- and post-intervention. The results showed the “ambiguous-negation-unrelated” intervention group scored higher on the TACT post-intervention, as compared to pre-intervention, a finding not observed among the “ambiguous-unrelated” and control groups. Furthermore, both art intervention groups generated more utterances overall (literal, conventional, and novel metaphors) in the MGT post-intervention, as compared to pre-intervention. These outcomes suggest this artwork intervention that utilized ambiguous image-text interactions and included theoretical discussion and reflective analysis can enhance divergent thinking. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Document clustering is an integral and important part of text mining. In case of classical clustering, data item belongs to only one cluster, whereas in Plithogenic approach to fuzzy clustering, data point may fall into more than one cluster. Thus, Plithogenic approach fuzzy clustering leads to wherein each data point is associated with more than one membership function that expresses the degree to which individual data points belong to the cluster. Additionally, his speeches at the UN will be analyzed with a neutrosphic approach. With the help of this approaches, in this study, speeches of the UN sessions attended by Turkish diplomats in the United Nations (UN) will be analyzed to understand the priorities of the country in international politics, the change and continuity in these policies. The texts of the UN sessions attended by Turkish diplomats between 2015 and 2023 were taken as data set. Such a large volume of data was analyzed with the help of text mining. For this purpose, each year's data was analyzed separately using word frequencies and clustering analysis, and then topic modeling was performed for each year's data using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

"The main purpose of the study was to analyze the lexical units involved in the representation of the URE ‘mountain’ concept in the language picture of the world of the Evenks. The identification of word meanings involved the examination of bilingual dictionaries of the Evenk language and field records of authentic texts narrated by informants who knew the Evenk and Russian languages well. According to the source study, the lexemes ure, а , and are the most commonly used representations of the concept URE in the Evenks’ world picture. The analysis revealed the meaning of lexemes ure, а , and and allowed their semes to be identified. The ure lexeme was found to have the semes: ‘overgrown with trees,’ ‘low hill,’ ‘inhabited by moose, bears, and other wild animals,’ and ‘master spirit of the mountain.’ The following semes were found for the lexeme: ‘stony,’ ‘covered with grass or reindeer moss,’ ‘inhabited by wild deer,’ ‘suitable for residence in summer,’ suitable for roaming,’ ‘suitable for deer grazing in summer,’ and ‘a good place for hiding deers from wolves.’ The lexeme is characterized by the semes: ‘rocky,’ ‘high,’ ‘made of stones,’ ‘cool place,’ and ‘inhabited by bighorn sheep, tarbagans, and musk deer.’ A conclusion is made that the URE ‘mountain’ concept formation was influenced by Evenks’ hunting and nomadic lifestyle combined with their animistic views on nature. The URE ‘mountain’ concept is a part of the BUGA ‘world’ concept structure. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: Digital transformation has become an important engine for economic high-quality development and environment high-level protection. However, green total factor productivity (GTFP), as an indicator that comprehensively reflects economic and environmental benefits, there is a lack of studies that analyze the effect of digital transformation on heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP from a micro perspective, and its impact mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, we aim to study the impact of digital transformation on heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP and its mechanism, and explore the heterogeneity of its impact. Methods: We use Chinese A-share listed enterprises in the heavily polluting industry data from 2007 to 2019, measure enterprise digital transformation indicator using text analysis, and measure enterprise GTFP indicator using the GML index based on SBM directional distance function, to investigate the impact of digital transformation on heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP. Results: Digital transformation can significantly enhance heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP, and this finding still holds after considering the endogenous problem and conducting robustness tests. Digital transformation can enhance heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP by promoting green innovation, improving management efficiency, and reducing external transaction costs. The improvement role of digital transformation on heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP is more obvious in the samples of non-state-owned enterprises, non-high-tech industries, and the eastern region. Compared with blockchain technology, artificial intelligence technology, cloud computing technology, big data technology, and digital technology application can significantly improve heavily polluting enterprises’ GTFP. Discussion: Our paper breaks through the limitations of existing research, which not only theoretically enriches the literature related to digital transformation and GTFP, but also practically provides policy implications for continuously promoting heavily polluting enterprises’ digital transformation and facilitating their high-quality development.

"Introduction: Despite the prevalence of post-traumatic disorder in internally displaced persons, which is well established, and the fact that respective international organizations are working on the issues, little attention is given in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, This study aims to review the available data about the prevalence and determinants of post-traumatic stress disorders among internally displaced people in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Studies published in the English language that have a clear outcome of interest and are available in full text were included. Six electronic databases were searched to identify published studies on the prevalence and determinants of posttraumatic stress disorder among IDPs in sub-Saharan Africa. This includes PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and the Web of Science. All relevant studies till June, 2023 were assessed. The review was done as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA-2009) and registered on PROSPERO (CRD420222997111). Results: Originally, 33,138 articles were found in six databases, and finally, eleven studies were reviewed. The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in sub-Saharan African countries was disproportionately presented in this review, ranging from 12.3% in Central Sudan to 85.5% in Nigeria. From a total of 11 studies, eight of them reported more than 50% of the magnitude of post-traumatic stress disorder, pointing to a higher magnitude of the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the region. The study identified numerous factors that contributed to post-traumatic stress disorder among the internally displaced population. Female gender, depression, anxiety, stress, being single, low level of educational status, experiencing or witnessing traumatic events, and psychological trauma were evidenced for their association with post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: These results demonstrate a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder compared to other regions of the world. The participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, including age, being single, being female, and a low level of education, were identified as factors contributing to PTSD. Moreover, the review identified that depression, anxiety, and experiencing or witnessing traumatic events were also influencing factors for PTSD among IDPs. The concerned bodies need to reinforce the monitoring and evaluation of the mental health programs of IDPs in the region.

"Female attorneys at the U.S. Supreme Court are less successful than male attorneys under some conditions because of gender norms, implicit expectations about how men and women should act. While previous work has found that women are more successful when they use more emotional language at oral arguments, gender norms are context sensitive. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted perhaps the most radical contextual shift in Supreme Court history: freewheeling in-person arguments were replaced with turn-based teleconference arguments. This change altered judicial decision-making and, I argue, justices' assessments of attorneys' gender performance. Using quantitative textual analysis of oral arguments, I demonstrate that justices implicitly evaluate gender performance with different metrics in each modality. Gender-normative levels of emotional language predict success in both formats. Function words, however, only predict success in teleconference arguments. Given gender's salience at the Supreme Court and in broader society, my findings prompt questions about the extent to which women can substantively impact case law.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"The event detection (ED) task aims to extract structured event information from unstructured text. Recent works in ED rely heavily on annotated training data and often lack the ability to construct semantic knowledge, leading to a significant dependence on resource. In this paper, we propose a hierarchy-aware model called HAEE by constructing event graph embeddings. We utilize two relations (cause and subevent) to help model events on two dimensions of polar coordinates, so as to distinguish events and establish event-event relations. Specifically, events under the cause relation are constructed at the same level of the hierarchy through rotation, while events under the subevent relation are constructed at different levels of the hierarchy through modulus. In this way, coexistence and interactions between relations in time and space can be fully utilized to enhance event representation and allow the knowledge to flow into the low-resource samples. The experiments show that HAEE has high performance in low-resource ED task, and the analysis of different dimensions of embeddings proves that HAEE can effectively model the semantic hierarchies in the event graph. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The literary adaptation into cinematic terms has become a ubiquitous phenomenon. In such a way, it brings about the intersection of the literary and the cine-text working towards assessing the intertextual resonances between the two. However, narratives can be subjected to several omissions and slippages which the artist intentionally devises. Formulating such gaps in between, the artist attempts to engage the attention of the readers/viewers and invites them to mend the fissures complying with the interpretive scope offered in the text. Venturing in a similar direction, the paper comparatively evaluates Bapsi Sidhwa’s Ice-Candy-Man with Deepa Mehta’s Earth. In doing so, it analyses the art of gap management as adopted and adapted from the literary precursor to the cinematic successor. To this end, it problematizes the creative approaches of the two artists involved. To put it differently, the perusal determines to what extent the writer and the director converge and diverge in the treatment of narratorial fissures by adopting the methodological tools of inclusion, omission and modification in the management of gaps in their respective renderings. Interestingly, such a perspective complicates the discourse around adaptation studies and offers a new insight into the process of adaptation. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The majority of the current research on sentiment analysis, which covers topics like political reviews, movie reviews, and product reviews, has developed quickly. The classification and clustering stage of sentiment analysis research involves a number of subjects. Some of them cover text classification comparison research and algorithm performance optimization. An intricate issue in sentiment analysis research is dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data. The sentiment analysis procedure and improving the efficacy of the classifier’s algorithm are both hampered by unstructured data. In order to manage unstructured data successfully and provide accurate and relevant information, unique strategies are required. The proposed classification model performance evaluation using Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree is specifically covered in this paper. According to the study’s findings, SVM has an accuracy rate of 96% and Naive Bayes is 86%. While the decision tree’s gain accuracy is 78 percent and the kNN classification model’s gain accuracy is 78 percent, respectively. The test results demonstrate that SVM is superior to other classification models in terms of accuracy performance. © 2023, Research Institute of Intelligent Computer Systems. All rights reserved."
"Cyberbullying has emerged as a pervasive issue in the digital age, necessitating advanced techniques for effective detection and mitigation. This research explores the integration of word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning to address the challenges of centralized data processing and user privacy concerns prevalent in previous methods. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships and contextual information, enabling a more nuanced understanding of text data, while emotional features derived from text extend the analysis to encompass the affective dimension, enhancing cyberbullying identification. Federated learning, a decentralized learning paradigm, offers a compelling solution to centralizing sensitive user data by enabling collaborative model training across distributed devices, preserving privacy while harnessing collective intelligence. In this study, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the fusion of word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning, complemented by the utilization of BERT, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Hyperparameters and neural architecture are explored to find optimal configurations, leading to the generation of superior results. These techniques are applied in the context of cyberbullying detection, using publicly available multi-platform (social media) cyberbullying datasets. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates superior performance and robustness compared to traditional methods. The results illustrate the enhanced ability to identify and combat cyberbullying incidents effectively, contributing to the creation of safer online environments. Particularly, the BERT model consistently outperforms other deep learning models (CNN, DNN, LSTM) in cyberbullying detection while preserving the privacy of local datasets for each social platform through our improved federated learning setup. We have provided Differential Privacy based security analysis for the proposed method to further strengthen the privacy and robustness of the system. By leveraging word embeddings, emotional features, and federated learning, this research opens new avenues in cyberbullying research, paving the way for proactive intervention and support mechanisms. The comprehensive approach presented herein highlights the substantial strengths and advantages of this integrated methodology, setting a foundation for future advancements in cyberbullying detection and mitigation.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Background: Evidence is inconsistent regarding the impact of late gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on perinatal outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate associations of GDM diagnosed in the third trimester (late GDM) with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Search Strategy: We searched Embase, Medline, and Web of Science from January 1, 1990 to June 16, 2022, for observational studies. Selection Criteria: Late GDM was defined as a de novo diagnosis, i.e. after a negative screening for diabetes in the second trimester, and at later than 28 weeks of pregnancy. Data Collection and Analysis: Each abstract and full-text article was independently reviewed by the same two authors. Quality was assessed with the use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. Main Results: Twelve studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria, including 3103 patients (571 with late GDM and 3103 controls). Incidences of shoulder dystocia (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02–2.42, P = 0.040), 5-minute Apgar score <7 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.14–2.86, P = 0.024), cesarean delivery (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.51–2.60, P < 0.001), and emergent cesarean delivery (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02–2.40, P = 0.040) were significantly higher among women with late GDM than among the controls. The groups showed similarity in the rates of fetal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age fetuses, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed associations of late GDM with increased adverse perinatal outcomes. Prospective studies should evaluate the impact on perinatal outcomes of repeated third-trimester screening for late GDM. © 2023 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics."
"This essay concentrates on the polyphonic hymns of the Strahov Codex (CZ-Ps DG IV 47), one of the most important late fifteenth-century repositories of music for the mass and the office. Delving into the connection between the source and the Trent Codices, it uncovers traces of compositional interactions between some of Strahov’s unica and settings of the same texts in Trent 88 (I-TRbc Ms. 1375). The melodic and contrapuntal similarities detected between pairs of settings suggest routine contrapuntal strategies. In turn, this analysis of the relatively simple hymn repertory contributes to reconstructing musical networks in central Europe. © 2023, Brepols Publishers. All rights reserved."
"In many respects, the work of the historian Lajos Thallóczy, published in 1884 under the title Oroszország és hazánk [Russia and Our Country],” stands out from the Russia-related studies and writings of his time. The great virtue of this volume is that, in addition to travel experiences, the author also draws on primary Russian archival sources and presents the Tsarist Russia of the 1880s from a wide variety of perspectives, while always keeping the Hungarian point of view in mind. The focus of his attention is the comparative presentation of Russian and Hungarian economic relations, with an emphasis on Russian-Hungarian competition in the grain market. Thallóczy sees the Tsarist Empire as a rival of concern from Hungary’s point of view, as well as a promising but untapped opportunity for bilateral trade relations. This method of analysis, which focuses on analogies and parallels, is a feature of the entire volume, including the chapters on travel experiences. The author has published comparative economic and social analyses that have opened up new lines of research and are still relevant today. A further interesting feature of the text is the separate chapter on Russian colonialism, which is also discussed in the context of the Austro-Hungarian occupation of the Balkans. There is a strong emphasis on comments on the Russian character, which abound in virtually every chapter. Mostly, this concerns the formulation of stereotypes that have become fixed in the meantime and which are also known from other travelogues of the time, that are echoed in the memoirs of Hungarian prisoners of war of the First World War and even in travelogues published between the two world wars. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"People around the world use social media to communicate and share their perceptions about a variety of topics. Social media analysis is crucial to interacting, distributing, and stating people's opinions on various topics. Governments and organizations can take action on alarming issues more quickly with the help of such textual data investigation. The key purpose of this effort is to perform sentiment analysis of textual data regarding National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET), perform classification and determine how people feel about NEET. In this study, 11 different machine learning classifiers were used to analyze tweet sentiment, along with natural language processing (NLP). Tweepy is the python library which is used to get user opinion about NEET Exam. Annotating the data is accomplished using TextBlob and Vader. Text data is pre-processed with a natural language toolkit. The dataset downloaded from Twitter shows that unigram models perform well compared to bigram and trigram models. TF-IDF models are more accurate than count vectorizer which is based on word frequency. SVM classifier achieves an average accuracy of 92%. Perceptron also receives the uppermost average accuracy of 91%. According to the data from the experiment, most people have a neutral opinion of NEET. © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."
"Traditional research on political parties pays little attention to the temporal focus of communication. It usually concentrates on promises, issue attention, and policy positions. This lack of scholarly attention is surprising, given that voters respond to nostalgic rhetoric and may even adjust issue positions when policy is framed in nostalgic terms. This article presents a novel dataset, PolNos, which contains six text-based measures of nostalgic rhetoric in 1,648 party manifestos across 24 European democracies from 1946 to 2018. The measures combine dictionaries, word embeddings, sentiment approaches, and supervised machine learning. Our analysis yields a consistent result: nostalgia is most prevalent in manifestos of culturally conservative parties, notably Christian democratic, nationalist, and radical right parties. However, substantial variation remains regarding regional differences and whether nostalgia concerns the economy or culture. We discuss the implications and use of our dataset for studying political parties, party competition, and elections. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press."
"Engineering or humanities data are stored in databases and are often used for search services. While the latest deep-learning technologies, such like BART and BERT, are utilized for data analysis, humanities data still rely on traditional databases. Representative analysis methods include n-gram and lexical statistical extraction. However, when using a database, performance limitation is often imposed on the result calculations. This study presents an experimental process using MariaDB on a PC, which is easily accessible in a laboratory, to analyze the impact of the database on data analysis performance. The findings highlight the fact that the database becomes a bottleneck when analyzing large-scale text data, particularly over hundreds of thousands of records. To address this issue, a method was proposed to provide real-time humanities data analysis web services by leveraging the open source database, with a focus on the Seungjeongwon-Ilgy, one of the largest datasets in the humanities fields. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering"

"The article analyses the Neurolinguistic Approach (NLA) (Netten & Germain, 2012), through its genesis (from 1997 to 2012). It covers the joint research work of Netten and Germain, which was catalyzed by the Canadian experimentation of the Intensive French program (IF) (Netten & Germain, 1998). On the basis of the contextualization research method (Blanchet, 2015, 2016), the broad heritage of the IF period is highlighted: the essential pedagogical and theoretical inputs have been incorporated in 2012, resulting in a text that is vast, dense and complex to grasp. On the basis of the diverse criticism with regard to the text as defined by Castellotti et al. (2017), and Huver (2014), we analyse the NLA along three axes: cultural diffusion—proved otherwise; a technical formative approach—verified; an epistemological positioning—the emphasis on empirical data, a quasi-experimental approach, the mobilization of neuroscience. © 2023 Universite Stendhal, Editions Litteraires et Linguistiques de l'Universite de Grenoble (ELLUG).

"Improving and updating applications based on user reviews is crucial to the continuous development of modern mobile applications. However, software bug descriptions in user reviews are often written by non-professional users, and contain a lot of irrelevant text, making it challenging to conduct bug localization. The current software bug localization technologies based on user reviews are not able to address these challenges effectively, resulting in suboptimal results. To address this issue, we propose ReviewLocator, which focuses on key phrases and learning from historical bug reports. It first utilizes syntactic analysis or source file parsing to convert each user review or source file into phrase representations. Then it depends on Key Phrase-based Ranking using a newly proposed Bug Report-based Term Weight to map review phrase sets to source file phrase sets. In our experiments on eight applications from the Google Play Store, the results prove our proposal surpasses ChangeAdvisor and Where2Change with an absolute improvement of 0.076 and 0.055 in terms of MAP correspondingly. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"Various office software based on cloud computing platforms have gradually become an important technical tool for scientific management, thus improving the quality and efficiency of enterprise management. These application systems generate a large amount of text data during operation and are stored in the relevant databases. Existing management systems can only perform simple queries on this data and are therefore un-able to carry out intelligent analysis of human behavioural characteristics. The intelligent management system needs to perform data mining on human behavioural characteristics, so as to uncover the hidden features of the massive data. To address the above prob-lems, an intelligent text mining and sentiment classification system based on K-means clustering analysis is constructed. First, the behavioural feature data of enterprise employees are pre-processed. Then, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to analyse the massive amount of historical data generated in the course of daily work in order to evaluate the employees. Secondly, an adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm based on dynamic subpopulation is proposed in order to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional K-means algorithm, and it is used to improve the K-means algorithm. Finally, the improved K-means algorithm was implemented in the Spark platform and the employee behavioural trait evaluation metrics were constructed. The experimental results show that the improved K-means algorithm effectively improves the clustering quality and convergence speed, thus effectively obtaining accurate and comprehensive employee sentiment assessment results. © 2023, Taiwan Ubiquitous Information CO LTD.

"Speech recognition using artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in everyday life, whether it's voice assistants for smartphones or smart speakers. Our voice command recognition systems, which are based on Deep Learning, are designed to recognize 10 specific German commands, which contain a maximum of two words, and convert them into a readable text. The two AI approaches used in this work are Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and convolutional neural network (ConvNet). These Networks have recently shown significant performance improvements in image and speech analysis. Our Models are realized with MATLAB® and finally optimized with suitable parameters. To enhance both recognition systems we used Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) Feature, instead of using raw wave signals. As a result, both approaches have reached a remarkable recognition accuracy. The best obtained validation accuracy was from the BiLSTM network, which has reached 98.22% and only one false positive classification by using it on a test data set. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis and evaluation of two different deep learning approaches for a speech commands recognition system.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Adolescents and young adults are increasingly acknowledged as mental health vulnerable populations whose mental health is particularly vulnerable. Conditions such as anxiety and depression are especially prevalent. The detection of these conditions and timely support in educational institutions remains a challenge, as they can have an important impact on the well-being of students and academic performance. In this article we present a new microblogging web platform designed to solve these problems by providing students with a safe, expressive space to freely communicate about topics of interest in their respective communities, providing the chance to do so. This platform encourages users to share their experiences, opinions and concerns. One of the main features of this platform is its seamless integration with various modules that capture valuable metrics of mental health. By linking the results of text analysis with data from commonly used questionnaires for mental health symptom detection, a comprehensive picture of an individual’s well-being can be established. In particular, we developed a support vector machine model specifically trained to identify depressive symptoms in the written language shared on the platform. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the microblogging platform in conjunction with the classification model. By leveraging this approach, educational institutions can gain insights into students’ mental health by analyzing their written expressions. This integrated system offers a promising strategy for detecting and addressing depressive symptoms among adolescents and young adults, ultimately contributing to improved well-being, academic performance, and targeted support in educational settings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), as a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, predicts polarities for given aspects in one text. However, in the process of aspect-based sentiment analysis, there may be multiple perspectives of sentiment-prone text information, as well as implicit sentiment expressions, which can cause greatly influence on the accuracy of sentiment analysis results. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose an aspect-based sentiment analysis model BERT-MSCBAM based on BERT and Multi-Scale Convolutional Block Attention Module (MSCBAM). Our model firstly uses BERT to encode the input text, then uses the MSCBAM module, which extracts the deep semantic and key features by its structure of two Multi-Scale Channel Attention Modules (CAMs) with different scales and one Spatial Attention Module (SAM) between them, combining with ResNet, and finally obtains the prediction results through a fully connected layer. To validate the effectiveness of our BERT-MSCBAM model, we conduct experiments on the Restaurant and Laptop datasets of SemEval2014 Task 4, and the Twitter dataset for our model in comparison with several current mainstream models. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The present paper focuses on the presentation and discussion of aspects of offensive lan-guage linguistic annotation, including the creation, annotation practice, curation, and evaluation of an offensive language annotation taxonomy scheme, that was first proposed in Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk et al. (2021). An extended offensive language ontology comprising 17 categories, structured in terms of 4 hierarchical levels, has been shown to represent the encoding of the defined offensive language schema, trained in terms of non-contextual word embeddings – i.e., Word2Vec and Fast Text, and eventually juxtaposed to the data acquired by using a pair wise training and testing analysis for existing categories in the HateBERT model (Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk et al. submitted). The study reports on the annotation practice in WG 4.1.1. Incivility in media and social media in the context of COST Action CA 18209 European network for Web-centred linguistic data science (Nexus Linguarum) with the INCEpTION tool (https://github.com/inception-project/incep-tion) – a semantic annotation platform offering assistance in the annotation. The results partly support the proposed ontology of explicit offense and positive implicitness types to provide more variance among widely recognized types of figurative language (e.g., meta-phorical, metonymic, ironic, etc.). The use of the annotation system and the representation of linguistic data were also evaluated in a series of the annotators’ comments, by means of a questionnaire and an open discussion. The annotation results and the questionnaire showed that for some of the categories there was low or medium inter-annotator agreement, and it was more challenging for annotators to distinguish between category items than between aspect items, with the category items offensive, insulting and abusive being the most difficult in this respect. The need for taxonomic simplification measureson the basis of these results has been recognized for further annotation practices. © 2023, Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics.

"The dynamic connectivity and functionality of sensors has revolutionized remote monitoring applications thanks to the combination of IoT and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Wearable wireless medical sensor nodes allow continuous monitoring by amassing physiological data, which is very useful in healthcare applications. These text data are then sent to doctors via IoT devices so they can make an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible. However, the transmission of medical text data is extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique. The cost of computing has been reduced by 93% due to the incorporation of aggregation technology. The communication cost is 400 bits which is a significant reduction when compared with its counterparts. The results of the security analysis show that the scheme is robust against forging, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The primary innovation is that the time required for signature verification can be reduced by using point addition and aggregation. In addition, it does away with the reliance on a centralized medical server in order to do verification. By taking a distributed approach, it is able to fully preserve user privacy, proving its superiority. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Artificial intelligence-based question-answering (QA) systems can expedite the performance of various tasks. These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language’s complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur’an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system. © 2023 Alrayzah et al.

"Thumbnails accelerate the concise description of a collection of images that iterate through large datasets till it trains our deep learning model to capture the text-whitened thumbnails. Many court cases and forensic investigations have involved thumbnail pictures within laptops or mobile devices. Millions of thumbnails are often ready for digital forensics experts to export. Machine learning can quickly help identify an investigation’s targets. Text or objective recognition is a primary study solution for document digitization and forensic analysis. Inspired by the recent success of Transformer in many applications, in this paper, we adopt design transfer learning as an effective method of achieving excellent performance with a noisy training of dataset of thumbnails. This deep learning model aims to investigate the pre-trained model in the Torch Vision package employing tensors and Cuda-GPU parallel computing to emphasize the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system engine. We report the preliminary results of our methods to help digital forensics experts to identify their targets robustly and efficiently. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Text-to-image generation intends to automatically produce a photo-realistic image, conditioned on a textual description. To facilitate the real-world applications of text-to-image synthesis, we focus on studying the following three issues: (1) How to ensure that generated samples are believable, realistic or natural? (2) How to exploit the latent space of the generator to edit a synthesized image? (3) How to improve the explainability of a text-to-image generation framework? We introduce two new data sets for benchmarking, i.e., the Good & Bad, bird and face, data sets consisting of successful as well as unsuccessful generated samples. This data set can be used to effectively and efficiently acquire high-quality images by increasing the probability of generating Good latent codes with a separate, new classifier. Additionally, we present a novel algorithm which identifies semantically understandable directions in the latent space of a conditional text-to-image GAN architecture by performing independent component analysis on the pre-trained weight values of the generator. Furthermore, we develop a background-flattening loss (BFL), to improve the background appearance in the generated images. Subsequently, we introduce linear-interpolation analysis between pairs of text keywords. This is extended into a similar triangular ‘linguistic’ interpolation. The visual array of interpolation results gives users a deep look into what the text-to-image synthesis model has learned within the linguistic embeddings. Experimental results on the recent DiverGAN generator, pre-trained on three common benchmark data sets demonstrate that our classifier achieves a better than 98% accuracy in predicting Good/Bad classes for synthetic samples and our proposed approach is able to derive various interpretable semantic properties for the text-to-image GAN model. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) aims to use images to locate and classify named entities in a given free text. The mainstream MNER method based on a pre-trained model ignores the syntactic relations in the text and associations between different data; however, these relations can provide crucial missing auxiliary information for the MNER task. Therefore, we propose an auxiliary and syntactic relation enhancement graph fusion (ASGF) method for MNER based on the cross-modal information between similar texts and long-distance inter-word syntactic dependencies in the text. First, for each text image pair (training sample), we search for a sample that is most similar to its text because similar samples may contain similar entity information. We then exploit a multimodal relation graph to model the association between different modal data of the two similar samples; that is, we use the similar sample to supplement the entity information of the text to be recognized. Second, we parse the syntax of the text to capture the syntactic dependencies between different words and integrate them into the relation graph to further enhance its semantic information. Finally, the relation graph is input into the graph neural network, multimodal information is interactively fused through the attention and gating mechanisms, and final MNER label sequence is predicted through CRF decoding. Extensive experimental results show that compared to mainstream methods, the proposed model achieved competitive recognition accuracy on public datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This paper presents MF-SET, a multi-task framework for sentiment analysis and aspect-opinion extraction in student evaluations of teaching (SET) in Spanish, which is an understudied area. We first prepared a novel aspect-opinion extraction dataset in Spanish that evaluates nine different aspects of teaching in both positive and negative light. We then developed a multi-task learning framework, including opinion segmentation, multi-class classification, and multi-label classification models for extracting information from Spanish text. The framework uses text generative abilities of GPT-3 combined with BERT to deal with the task. For multi-class classification, we used BERT with different feature sets and sentiments about teachers with respect to their recommendation, intellectual challenges, and learning guidance. Our results show that the model’s performance varies depending on the feature sets and classifiers. Opinion segmentation and multi-label classification were fine-tuned on GPT-3 for the best results of 0.68 Micro F1 for positive and 0.72 for negative aspects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The large language model ChatGPT developed by the American artificial intelligence company OpenAI has quickly become a hot topic in the global media as soon as it is launched. The “Pseudo-Environment” and “discourse field” formed by these media reports have profound implications for governments, industries, and the public. By exploring the core issues and key debates in media coverage of ChatGPT, it is possible to effectively map media attitudes, industry perceptions, and public sentiment. In this study, text mining methods such as sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling were employed to analyze 2,829 valid news data obtained from the LexisNexis news database. The research results reveal that the news coverage of ChatGPT primarily involves areas such as technological development, functional applications, and social impact. Sentiment analysis indicates that the media generally hold a positive attitude towards ChatGPT, albeit with some negative evaluations. Topic mining results demonstrate that the core issues and key debates include “new challenges of intelligent automation for human labor,” “novel human-machine collaboration paradigms,” “a new milestone in artificial intelligence,” and “new tests for AI ethics and societal issues.“ © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"Text Reuse reveals meaningful reiterations of text in large corpora. Humanities researchers use text reuse to study, e.g., the posterior reception of influential texts or to reveal evolving publication practices of historical media. This research is often supported by interactive visualizations which highlight relations and differences between text segments. In this paper, we build on earlier work in this domain. We present impresso Text Reuse at Scale, the to our knowledge first interface which integrates text reuse data with other forms of semantic enrichment to enable a versatile and scalable exploration of intertextual relations in historical newspaper corpora. The Text Reuse at Scale interface was developed as part of the impresso project and combines powerful search and filter operations with close and distant reading perspectives. We integrate text reuse data with enrichments derived from topic modeling, named entity recognition and classification, language and document type detection as well as a rich set of newspaper metadata. We report on historical research objectives and common user tasks for the analysis of historical text reuse data and present the prototype interface together with the results of a user evaluation.

"Identifying opinion leaders in social networks, particularly in social media, is a crucial marketing strategy. These individuals have a considerable influence on the purchasing decisions of their communities. Companies can benefit from collaborating with relevant opinion leaders in their market as this can increase their visibility, establish their credibility, and gain consumer trust, leading to increased sales, improved brand perception, and an expanded market share. Additionally, by gaining a comprehensive understanding of opinion leaders, companies can better comprehend the trends and preferences of their target audience. This allows them to tailor their marketing and product strategies more effectively. Identifying suitable influencers to endorse their products or services is a significant challenge for companies. The identification of opinion leaders is complicated by their informal and unstructured nature, as well as the varying selection criteria depending on the marketing campaign's goals. While numerous research studies have focused on detecting opinion leaders in social networks based on content, interactions, or a combination of both, few have explored sentiment analysis of post content, received interactions, and user comments in relation to published posts. The purpose of this paper is to present an hybrid approach to detect opinion leaders in Facebook. This approach involves analyzing the trajectory of post content by examining interactions on the post, as well as mining the text content of the post itself and analyzing the users'comments sentiments.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The successful application of large pre-trained models such as BERT in natural language processing has attracted more attention from researchers. Since the BERT typically acts as an end-to-end black box, classification systems based on it usually have difficulty in interpretation and low robustness. This paper proposes a visual interpretation-based self-improving classification model with a combination of virtual adversarial training (VAT) and BERT models to address the above problems. Specifically, a fine-tuned BERT model is used as a classifier to classify the sentiment of the text. Then, the predicted sentiment classification labels are used as part of the input of another BERT for spam classification via a semi-supervised training manner using VAT. Additionally, visualization techniques, including visualizing the importance of words and normalizing the attention head matrix, are employed to analyze the relevance of each component to classification accuracy. Moreover, brand-new features will be found in the visual analysis, and classification performance will be improved. Experimental results on Twitter’s tweet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on the classification task. Furthermore, the ablation study results illustrate the effect of different components of the proposed model on the classification results. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"Learning from multiple documents is an essential ability in today’s society. This experimental study used concept network analysis to consider how reading prompts and post-reading generative learning tasks can alter students’ documents integration performance. Undergraduates (N = 119) read three documents about Alzheimer’s disease with one of two reading prompts (integrative prompts vs. detailed prompts) and then after reading completed a generative learning task (concept mapping vs. summary writing). Three days later they completed a delayed writing task and an inference verification test. Participants’ written texts were converted to concept networks to evaluate conceptual level integration, including the quantity of integration (measured by the proportion of integrative links), the semantic quality of integration (measured by the similarity of integrative links), and the structural quality of integration (measured by comparing network graph centrality). Results showed that the integrative prompts relative to the detailed prompts enhanced the quantity of integration but not the semantic and structural quality. Further, concept mapping relative to summary writing significantly improved the structural quality of integration. In summary, this study describes a new concept network approach for measuring different aspects of integration to advance theory and research in multiple document comprehension. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications and Technology."
"Introduction: Pharmacological therapy is recommended as a second-line alternative to reverse obesity. Currently, five anti-obesity drugs (AODs) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management. The aim of this paper is to investigate the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of AODs through a systematic review with a special focus on methodological considerations. Methods: We searched the general and specific databases to identify the primary pharmacoeconomic evaluation of AODs. Results: A total of 18 full-text articles and three conference abstracts were included in this review. Most of the economic assessments were still about Orlistat. And the observations we could make were consistent with the previous systematic review. A few studies were on the combined therapies (i.e. PHEN/TPM ER and NB ER) compared to different comparators, which could hardly lead to a generalized summary of the cost-effectiveness. Most recently, pharmacoeconomic evidence on the newest GLP 1 RA approved for the indication of obesity or obesity with at least one comorbidity emerged gradually. Modelling-based cost-utility analysis is the major type of assessment method. In the modelling studies, a manageable number of the key health states and the state transitions were structured to capture the disease progression. In particular, the principal structure of the decision model adopted in the three studies on the newly approved drug was nearly the same, which enables more in-depth comparisons and generalizations of the findings. Conclusion: This study provided an up-to-date overview of the strengths and areas for improvement in the methodological design of the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the licensed drugs for chronic weight management. Future modelling evaluations would benefit from a better understanding of the long-term weight loss effects of the current therapeutic options and the weight rebound process after the discontinuation of treatment.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across numerous disciplines, primarily assessed through tasks in language generation, knowledge utilization, and complex reasoning. However, their alignment with human emotions and values, which is critical for real-world applications, has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we assessed LLMs' Emotional Intelligence (EI), encompassing emotion recognition, interpretation, and understanding, which is necessary for effective communication and social interactions. Specifically, we first developed a novel psychometric assessment focusing on Emotion Understanding (EU), a core component of EI. This test is an objective, performance-driven, and text-based evaluation, which requires evaluating complex emotions in realistic scenarios, providing a consistent assessment for both human and LLM capabilities. With a reference frame constructed from over 500 adults, we tested a variety of mainstream LLMs. Most achieved above-average Emotional Quotient (EQ) scores, with GPT-4 exceeding 89% of human participants with an EQ of 117. Interestingly, a multivariate pattern analysis revealed that some LLMs apparently did not rely on the human-like mechanism to achieve human-level performance, as their representational patterns were qualitatively distinct from humans. In addition, we discussed the impact of factors such as model size, training method, and architecture on LLMs' EQ. In summary, our study presents one of the first psychometric evaluations of the human-like characteristics of LLMs, which may shed light on the future development of LLMs aiming for both high intellectual and emotional intelligence.

"Medical crowdfunding is an individualizing and privatizing response to healthcare inequalities, in which citizens use online platforms to share (written and visual) stories about health-related needs in order to elicit donations. We present data from a study of medical crowdfunding in Aotearoa New Zealand, drawing on critical theory and fat studies to analyze weight-loss-related campaigns, with a focus on visibility and visuality. We highlight the complexities involved in making fat (and otherwise non-normative) bodies acceptable, marketable, and deserving to online audiences. Through a reflexive thematic analysis of text and images, across nineteen public Givealittle campaigns related to intentional weight loss, we identified five main themes relating to how the fat body was presented. These themes include: unwell bodies, transitional bodies, active bodies, objectified bodies, and wretched bodies. We show that the ability of particular bodies to generate specific moral emotions (that can, through these platforms, be turned into care/healthcare access) depends largely on their relationship to normative ideas of the “good” body. Our analysis offers insight into how people negotiate hierarchies of deservingness, based on entrenched normativities, while living in non-normative bodies. More specifically, we show how people pursuing intentional weight loss use images to regulate themselves according to a wider anti-fat and neoliberal logic of deservingness. We explore images on crowdfunding campaigns as a form of both media labor and moral labor, highlighting the double-bind of the digital gaze upon bodies that are unable to access privileged states of health without being made visible to scrutiny. © 2023 Taylor & Francis."
"Purpose: This article aims to explore how the mapping strategies between user requirements expressed by the humanities researchers lead to a better customization of user-driven digital humanities tools and to the creation of innovative functionalities, which can directly affect the way of doing research in a digital context. Design/methodology/approach: It describes the user-driven development of a tool that helps researchers in the quantitative and qualitative analysis of large textbook collections. Findings: This article presents an exemplary user journey map, which shows the different steps of the digital transformation process and how the humanities researchers are involved for (1) producing innovative research solutions, comprehensive and personalized reports, and (2) customizing access to content data used for the analysis of digital documents. The article is based on a case study on a German textbooks collection and content analysis functionalities. Originality/value: The focus of this article is the reiterative research process, in which humanists (from the human centred point of view) starts from an initial research question, using quantitative and qualitative data and develops both the research question and the answers to it by with the aim to find patterns in the content and structure of educational media. Thus, from the viewpoint of digital transformation the humanist is part of the interaction between digitization and digitalization processes, where he/she uses digital data, metadata, reports and findings created and supported by the digital tools for research analysis. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The rapid development of deep learning and artificial intelligence has transformed our approach to solving scientific problems across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic content generation. Information retrieval (IR) has also experienced significant advancements, with natural language understanding and multimodal content analysis enabling accurate information retrieval. However, the widespread adoption of neural networks has also influenced the focus of IR problem-solving, which nowadays predominantly relies on evaluating the similarity of dense vectors derived from the latent spaces of deep neural networks. Nevertheless, the challenges of conducting similarity searches on large-scale databases with billions of vectors persist. Traditional IR approaches use inverted indices and vector space models, which work well with sparse vectors. In this paper, we propose Vec2Doc, a novel method that converts dense vectors into sparse integer vectors, allowing for the use of inverted indices. Preliminary experimental evaluation shows a promising solution for large-scale vector-based IR problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) and emotional response generation (ERG) are two important NLP tasks. ERC aims to detect the utterance-level emotion from a dialogue, while ERG focuses on expressing a desired emotion. Essentially, ERC is a classification task, with its input and output domains being the utterance text and emotion labels, respectively. On the other hand, ERG is a generation task with its input and output domains being the opposite. These two tasks are highly related, but surprisingly, they are addressed independently without making use of their duality in prior works. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to solve these two tasks in a dual learning framework. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We propose a dual learning framework for ERC and ERG. (2) Within the proposed framework, two models can be trained jointly, so that the duality between them can be utilised. (3) Instead of a symmetric framework that deals with two tasks of the same data domain, we propose a dual learning framework that performs on a pair of asymmetric input and output spaces, i.e., the natural language space and the emotion labels. (4) Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. IEEE"
"Background: The aim of the present study was to compare dental indexes of pediatric Down syndrome (DS) patients to those who are healthy. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement guidelines. The researchers searched title and abstract of major databases, including ProQuest (ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Full Text: Health and Medicine, ProQuest Nursing and Allie Health Source), PubMed, Google Scholar, clinical key, up to date, springer, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science (ISI), up to September 2020 with restriction to English and Persian language This meta-analysis study had three outcomes: decay/miss/filled index, plaque index, and gingival index. Effect size, including mean difference and its 95% of confidence interval, was calculated. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale measured the quality of the selected studies. Heterogeneity was performed using the Q test and I 2 index, and reporting bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger and Begg's tests. Results: Fifteen studies conducted were included in the meta-analysis process. Conclusion: It showed that DS patients had a higher plaque index and gingival index than healthy individuals, which means that the oral health status of these patients is worse and needs more attention. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Background: Many obstacles challenge the establishment and expansion of cardiac surgery in low- and middle-income countries, despite the unmet cardiac surgical needs. One challenge has been providing adequate follow-up care to monitor anticoagulation, manage morbidity, and prevent mortality. This systematic review describes outcomes after valvular cardiac surgery and focuses on strategies for prolonged follow-up care in resource-constrained settings. Methods: Studies published between 2012 and 2022 were collected from Embase and the Cochrane Library. Article inclusion criteria were adolescent and adult patients, open heart valvular surgery, and analysis of at least 1 postoperative outcome at least 30 days postoperatively. Studies that focused on pediatric patients, pregnant patients, transcatheter procedures, in-hospital outcomes, and nonvalvular surgical procedures were excluded. Descriptive statistics were assessed, and articles were summarized after abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction. Results: Sixty-seven relevant publications were identified after screening. The most commonly studied regions were Asia (46%), Africa (36%), and Latin America (9%). Rheumatic heart disease was the most commonly studied valvular disease (70%). Reported outcomes included mortality, surgical reintervention, and thrombotic events. Follow-up duration ranged from 30 days to 144 months; 11 studies reported a follow-up length of 12 months. Conclusions: Addressing the unmet cardiac care needs requires a multifaceted approach that leverages telemedicine technology, enhances medical infrastructure, and aligns advocacy efforts. Learning from the cost-effective establishment of cardiac surgery in low- and middle-income countries, we can apply past innovations to foster sustainable cardiac surgical capacity. © 2023 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons"
"Estimating the degree of multiple personality traits in a single image is challenging due to the presence of multiple people, occlusion, poor quality etc. Unlike existing methods which focus on the classification of a single personality using images, this work focuses on estimating different personality traits using a single image. We believe that when the image contains multiple persons and modalities, one can expect multiple emotions and expressions. This work separates given input images into different faces of people, recognized text, meta-text and background information using face segmentation, text recognition and scene detection techniques. Contrastive learning is explored to extract features from each segmented region based on clustering. The proposed work fuses textual and visual features extracted from the image for estimating the degree of multiple personality traits. Experimental results on our benchmark datasets show that the proposed model is effective and outperforms the existing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Emoji symbols are widely used in digital communication to express emotions, feelings, and moods. However, their potential for structuring and visualizing ctional and real life empirical concepts has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel technology of using emoji symbols to create and analyze digital representations of literary texts and cultural icons. We apply our technology to two case studies: the poetry of the twentieth century Cuban poet José Ángel Buesa and the image of Borys Grinchenko as a patron of the Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. We use the Emoji Maker program to construct emoji signs that capture the essence and sensuality of the lyrical images and concepts. We also use the Voyant Tools web application to visualize the corpus data based on text mining and keyword analysis. We demonstrate that our technology enhances the understanding and appreciation of literary texts and cultural icons by activating students’ thinking, developing creative attention, and fostering comprehensive digital literacy. Our technology oers a new model of digital presentation of ction and culture that relies on the poly-functional emoji ousia and the polylaterial metalinguistic multimodality of the sign meaning. Our technology also poses some challenges, such as the technical limitations of the Emoji Maker platform, the subjective interpretation of emoji symbols, and the ethical issues of using emoji in academic contexts. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"To tackle the COVID-19 infodemic, we analysed 58,625 articles from 460 unverified sources, that is, sources that were indicated by fact checkers and other mis/disinformation experts as frequently spreading mis/disinformation, covering the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. Our aim was to identify the main narratives of COVID-19 mis/disinformation, develop a codebook, automate the process of narrative classification by training an automatic classifier, and analyse the spread of narratives over time and across countries. Articles were retrieved with a customised version of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) processing chain providing a stream of text items. Machine translation was employed to automatically translate non-English text to English and clustering was carried out to group similar articles. A multi-level codebook of COVID-19 mis/disinformation narratives was developed following an inductive approach; a transformer-based model was developed to classify all text items according to the codebook. Using the transformer-based model, we identified 12 supernarratives that evolved over the three years studied. The analysis shows that there are often real events behind mis/disinformation trends, which unverified sources misrepresent or take out of context. We established a process that allows for near real-time monitoring of COVID-19 mis/disinformation. This experience will be useful to analyse mis/disinformation about other topics, such as climate change, migration, and geopolitical developments. Copyright: © 2023 Kotseva et al.

"Drawing on scholars of critical theory and pedagogy, we understand power as operating within nested social systems, meaning that individuals experiencing injustice are impacted not only by the most immediate agent of that injustice but also by the broader institutions, policies, and values of their society. The practice of attending to power and how it shapes our societies at multiple levels (i.e., power analysis) is necessary to critical research approaches, including Critical Participatory Action Research (CPAR). While adolescents and adults (the age groups most commonly engaging in CPAR) are likely to have developed some understanding of systems of power through experience, dialog, and/or educational experiences, children participating in CPAR have generally had fewer opportunities to develop this type of analysis. In our own CPAR projects with 3rd–5th grade children, we have witnessed the challenges and possibilities of exploring power with child CPAR team members. In this paper, we introduce a methodological tool that we developed to facilitate power analysis during critical research projects like these: The Power Rainbow. The Power Rainbow is a graphic representation of nested systems of power, which can be utilized with children in multiple ways throughout the CPAR process. The tool concretizes the abstract concept of systemic power through shape, color, and text, and scaffolds the type of structural thinking necessary to research and take action towards more just futures.

"Document image translation (DIT) deserves more attention on account of its importance in many real-world scenarios. It is a challenging task because of the layout degeneration and noisy text translation problems caused by the optical character recognition (OCR) model. Moreover, due to the task-specific annotation, existing document image datasets usually do not support in-depth DIT analysis and model development. So, to motivate a broader investigation, this paper presents a dataset named DITrans, which provides fine-grained annotations for English-to-Chinese DIT task. It contains 2.8k English document images in three domains: political report, scientific article and paper book. Each document image has been annotated with layout structure, source text and translation references. Based on DITrans, a novel framework, which strengthens the conventional OCR-Translation cascade in layout awareness and noise robustness for better DIT, has been proposed. Furthermore, benchmark evaluations and detailed analysis based on this framework have been conducted. The evaluations and analysis results demonstrate that the dataset is very practical and can facilitate full-stack analysis and long-term research on DIT. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

"This paper presents the study of the code-switching phenomenon in Bashkir-Russian spontaneous discourse. The analysis covered 323 eastern dialect texts taken from the Textual database of the dialectological sub-fund of the Machine fund of the Bashkir language (http://mfbl2.ru/mfb/bashdial). This database documents only 2208 uses of code-switches, accounting for only 2.6 % of the total number of word-uses. Detailed consideration is given to the features of foreign-language units’ functioning in the spontaneous speech of the Bashkirs. The analysis of the frequency statistics of code-switching by parts of speech allowed the percentage of code-switching by parts of speech to be identified. Given the structure diversity of the languages under study, special attention is paid to the cases of using formative and inflectional markers (matrix language or guest language) in code-switching. Code-switching structures are inclusions (single lexemes of the guest language) and insular switches (several lexical units or phrases of the guest language). The main pragmatic causes of code-switching are indicated. These are reference, subject-thematic, and citation factors. The texts under analysis feature code-switching patterns practically with all parts of speech, except for interjections, imitative, and vocative words. Of interest, the inclusion of code-switches in the morphosyntactic structure of the matrix language is not found to have a significant impact on the sentence word order. While adopting inflectional and formative markers of the matrix language, code-switches are integrated into a sentence without affecting the correct perception of information. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"This article examines what happens when first grade students (age six) interact and talk with each other while writing individual texts. The data for the study comprises observations and video-recordings from 26 writing lessons in two different first grade classrooms in Norway. The study builds on sociocultural theories of writing that argue that writing is an activity that unfolds within writing communities in which each writer’s knowledge and skills have the potential to become a shared resource for the participants. The analysis found that students’ interactions can be grouped into five categories: copying, unsolicited advice, subteaching, mutual commenting and ignored initiatives. Within these different patterns of interaction, students seemed to explore and practice writing in varying ways; so it is therefore useful for teachers to be aware of what type of interaction is occurring. The findings indicate that students’ interaction elicits many benefits, as students are found to practice spelling, handwriting, and composing; use and develop their writing metalanguage; and experience being writers in a writing community. At the same time, interaction can make students socially vulnerable, and advice from peers can be too focused on correctness and can be unwelcome. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Background: Obesity and periodontitis are two commonly occurring disorders that affect a considerable amount of the world's population. Several studies have mentioned that there may be a link between the two. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether there was a difference in response to nonsurgical periodontal therapies (NSPTs) between obese and nonobese individuals. Materials and Methods: An online search was assembled with a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text words of the literature published up to December 2020, to identify interventional studies limited to an adult human population. Titles, abstracts, and finally full texts were scrutinized for possible inclusion by two independent investigators. Reduction in periodontal pocket depth was the primary parameter used to assess the outcome of NSPT. Results: The primary search yielded 639 significant titles and abstracts. After filtering, data extraction, and quality assessment, 34 full-text studies were selected. All studies matching inclusion criteria, suggest a positive association between obesity and periodontal disease. Conclusion: Although a possible correlation exists between periodontitis and obesity, as with other oral-systemic disease implications, some controversy exists. While some studies have reported a distinct correlation between periodontitis and obesity, other papers have suggested only moderate or no association between the two conditions at all. These results advise of a difference between response to NSPT amid obese and nonobese individuals. However, with few quality studies and variable reported findings, there is limited evidence of any significant difference in clinical practice. However, it can be a positive warning that obesity is a risk factor toward the outcome of periodontal disease treatment. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."
"Watching a movie for three minutes has become a popular term in contemporary life, and people also hope to spend less time understanding the emotional direction and general plot of long novels. Currently, research on emotional analysis in novels mainly focuses on foreign languages. This article introduces Graph Convolutional Neural networks into the text emotion classification of novels. Text GCN is used to conduct emotion analysis on Ba Jin’s novel “The Rapids Trilogy”, and iStoryline is used to visualize the storyline of literary works. Visual coding adjustments are made based on the results of emotion analysis in the generated storyline, where line aggregation and dispersion represent whether the characters appear in the same scene, The brighter the color of the lines, the more positive the emotions, making the visualization more vivid, full, and beautiful. The experimental results indicate that this method enables readers to easily grasp the overall direction of the novel’s plot and have a clearer understanding of the emotional changes of the characters. In addition, the accuracy of the Text GCN model is superior to traditional sentiment classification methods on Chinese datasets. This method provides a new approach for emotional analysis and narrative visualization research in literary works, and can be extended to other fields of digital entertainment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"We examine the role of culture in comprehension. Prominent theories of comprehension conceptualized the outcome of reading as learners’ construction of a cognitive representation of texts. We emphasize that such representation reflects not only texts’ content, but also individuals’ understandings of the real world, as described in texts. We suggest that, thus, individuals should be supported to question and analyze the mental representations that they form; we use the term “culture” to capture such questioning and analysis. Rather than an individual difference factor, we argue for conceptualizing culture as a way of thinking, or as individuals’ reasoning about the commonalities and differences in their and others’ worldviews and the linking of these to underlying values. When such reasoning is engaged in reference to texts, we refer to this as culturalized comprehension; when such reasoning is further engaged to resist or recast the values introduced in texts to generate counternarratives, we refer to this as critical culturalized comprehension. In emphasizing the importance of culturalized and critical culturalized comprehension and describing the set of cognitive processes involved, we argue for research in educational psychology to examine how learners may be consciously, reflectively, and critically engaged in using texts to understand their world. © 2023 Division 15, American Psychological Association."

"The aim of the article is to study the poem “The Japanese Temple” (from the collection “Time Off”) by the famous ethnographer, writer, translator and stylizer of oriental poetry Mikhail Shcherbakov. The study has revealed the influence of Ivan Bunin’s book of lyrics and essays “The Temple of the Sun” and the opening poem of the same title on the composition of the entire Shcherbakov’s collection “Time Off” and especially on the text under analysis. “The Japanese Temple” seems to smoothly balance between the form of an eastern tanka and the Italian tercets used by Bunin. Perhaps, the “gates” of “The Temple of the Sun” from Bunin’s poem influenced the choice of the title of the eastern emigrants’ collection of poems and prose “The Gates”, where “The Japanese Temple” was published in 1934. And Shcherbakov, submitting the poem to this publication, had Bunin’s text in mind. The article highlights the significance of M. Urvantsev’s illustrations for “Time Off”: as in Bunin’s “The Temple of the Sun”, where, in addition to drawings depicting antiquities, two floral ornaments are presented in front of the poems “The Temple of the Sun” and “The Shadow of a Bird”, so in “Time Off” first letters stylized into pictures to begin Shcherbakov’s texts are used – they are small vignettes that respond to the text. In his collection of poems, Shcherbakov uses the technique of ekphrasis, trying to show “art within art”, “to wrap” eastern architecture and painting into a new form – language, images, rhymes and rhythm. The scope of the study in the article covers the lyrics of the poets of the “eastern” emigration, in particular, Mikhail Shcherbakov’s collection of poems “Time Off” and the poem “The Japanese Temple”. The literature of the eastern branch looked toward the western emigrant culture and the Russian context, but it also influenced them itself. The dependence of the poetry and prose of the eastern line on the topos chosen by the writers enriched the literature of the twentieth century with new shades (even fresh exotic motifs), and at the same time, this connection of traditions demonstrates how the Silver Age embraced both the emigrant West and the emigrant East with its influence. © 2023 Authors.

"Pre-trained language models (LMs) have been widely used in sentiment analysis, and some recent works have focused on injecting sentiment knowledge from sentiment lexicons or structured commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) into pre-trained LMs, which have achieved remarkable success. However, these works often only obtain knowledge from a single source in either the sentiment lexicon or the KG, and only perform very shallow fusion of LM representations and external knowledge representations. Therefore, how to effectively extract multiple sources of external knowledge and fully integrate them with the LM representations is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced model for sentiment analysis (KSA), which simultaneously incorporates commonsense and sentiment knowledge as external knowledge, by constructing a heterogeneous Commonsense-Senti Knowledge Graph. Additionally, a separate global token and global node are added to the text sequence and constructed knowledge graph respectively, and a fusion unit is used to enable global information interaction between the different modalities, allowing them to perceive each other’s information and thereby improving the ability to perform sentiment analysis. Experiments on standard datasets show that our proposed KSA significantly outperforms the strong pre-trained baselines, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on most of the test datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"In pockets of media and communication for development and social change (MCDSC) a distinct set of practices around a worldview emphasizing optimism, chic, creativity, boldness, and “changemaking” is emerging. This trend is in stark contrast with the momentum of our current academic debates exploring the role of communication in the decolonization of MCDSC. This article aims to bring greater critical attention to what I term communication for social changemaking. Through an analysis of selected cases from a sample of program texts spanning 10 years, communication for social changemaking is found to rest on an underlying “spirit” that justifies the employment of capitalist mechanisms for social purposes and a common good. This article argues that there is an urgent need to critically interrupt the assimilation of global capitalist values in MCDSC practice where they undermine social justice goals, and also calls for research to explore how practitioners are both adapting and resisting these discourses. © 2023 (Jessica Noske-Turner).

"The subject of this study is the process of developing block symmetric ciphers with improved cryptographic stability indicators for solving the problems of information protection in information and communication systems. The goal of this study is to develop a mathematical model of the optimal s-box design (non-linear substitution block) for modern block symmetric ciphers. Task: to show that the stability of block symmetric ciphers does not significantly depend on the indicators of the s-boxes included in these ciphers; to justify their use without reducing the stability of random substitutions as s-box constructions of modern block symmetric ciphers; and to prove the futility of searching for s-boxes with special properties. The methods used are: methods of probability theory; mathematical statistics; combinatorics and system analysis; methods of statistical tests; and methods of Boolean algebra. The following results were obtained. In modern ciphers, nonlinear substitution transformations are used as S-boxes (in most ciphers, byte substitutions are used). S-boxes perform the main function of encryption transformation - mixing of text bits. Dynamic indicators of the arrival of the cipher in the state of random substitution depend on their effectiveness. The presented results confirm that the indicators of cipher stability do not significantly depend on the indicators of the S-boxes included in the ciphers. It is not the individual properties of substitutions, but the results of their sequential interactions decisive for achieving stability indicators. It is shown that the fee for encryption is chosen to be three to four times greater than the depth of the avalanche effect - the minimum number of cycles of the cipher’s arrival to the state of random substitution) is hardly noticeable. Conclusions. The scientific novelty of the obtained results is as follows. This work represents a generalization of the transition to the use of random permutations as S-boxes is an increase of only one cycle in the number of cycles of the arrival of the cipher to the state of random permutations, and this is hardly no-ticeable against the background of the stability margin used in modern ciphers. The result of this generalization is a scientific statement that can be described as follows: random S-boxes can be used in all known modern ciphers without reducing stability. That is, the task of finding S-boxes with special properties loses any meaning, which means that the scientific direction related to the search for S-boxes with special properties becomes redundant. © Iryna Lysytska, Kostiantyn Lysytskyi, Oleksii Nariezhnii, Tetiana Hrinenko, 2023"
"The length and extension of legal processes are two of the main problems of contemporary justice. Adopting process analysis techniques can serve to understand the course of these processes, to identify bottlenecks, and to propose improvements. This paper showcases an exploration of legal event logs using process mining techniques. First, we discuss the results obtained by applying state-of-the art process discovery techniques to data obtained from public tenders. Then, we show how to use natural language processing to automatically extract events and dates from the texts of the tenders and leverage this information for improving the results of process mining techniques. As a proof-of-concept, we propose a comparison of the French, Spanish, and Italian cases through process discovery based on calls for tenders from the European TED repository. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"BACKGROUND: Policy tools embody policy concepts and are essential to achieving policy objectives. The effective allocation of policy tools directly impacts the effectiveness of community governance and determines the modernization process of grassroots governance. We aim to analyze the logic of community governance policy tool selection, and then provide assistance for the modernization of grassroots governance. METHODS: We selected 100 national and provincial government work reports and 63 policy documents related to community governance during China's ""12th Five-Year Plan"" to ""14th Five-Year Plan"" period as analysis samples. And build an analysis framework based on the three dimensions of time, space, and tools. We used Nvivo.20 software for text encoding analysis. RESULTS: Based on the model framework, we analyze the results as follows. From the perspective of the time dimension, among the five types of policy tools, the proportion of command-type policy tools used showed a downward trend, from 88.16% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 83.50% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. However, motivation-type and persuasion-type tools showed an upward trend, rising from 1.34% and 5.26% in the 12th Five-Year Plan period to 3.40% and 8.74% in the 14th Five-Year Plan respectively. The system-change-type policy tools decreased from 1.32% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 0.97% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. The proportion of capacity-building-type policy tools has gradually increased from 2.63% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 4.85% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. From the perspective of spatial dimension, apart from command and persuasion policy tools, the usage frequency of the other three types of policy tools in the three major regions all display a ""growth-decline-growth"" trend. From the perspective of tool dimension, command-type policy tools are dominant in China's community governance, with a cumulative frequency of 1405 times and a high proportion of 81.75%. Apart from command policy tools, persuasive policy tools and capacity-building policy tools have a relatively high proportion, with usage frequencies of 186 and 78 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that current community governance policy tools mainly consist of command tools. However, there is a trend towards combining tools such as command, persuasion, incentive, capacity building, and system change in the future. There is a typical contradiction between instrumental rationality and value rationality, indicating an evolution from instrumental rationality to the integration of instrumental and value rationality. This study addresses the conflict of policy tools through rational guidance of values, the rational guarantee of tools, and cooperation to achieve the goal of high-quality development of community governance.

"The impact COVID-34 has demanded an additional e[ort from the media to report a virus of global reach. During the lockdown, there has been an increase in information consumption derived from the interest and concern of citizens to know the characteristics, development, and threats of the coronavirus. Although social networks have ranked \rst among the cyberspace platforms most consulted by citizens, di[erent studies indicate that citizens consider newspapers and magazines to have ‘good intentions’ compared to the ‘worst intentions’ of cyber-media and websites. Based on this, the research focuses on the covers of the paper editions of the newspapers, conceived as a fundamental element that synthesizes and hierarchizes the content that each medium considers of greatest importance and that is connected to the digital version of each medium. This research presents a comparative study of the newspaper covers of eight countries in the world (Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, France, Portugal, United States, Russia, and Germany) to analyze the number of news items about the pandemic, the type of text, the typology of information sources, the characters, the use of color, the inclusion and the focus of the photographs or the location on the page, among other parameters. The study analyzes IYY front pages of 3] daily newspapers (I per country) in the world, collecting 3,XZY news items that include Z3V pieces of news, and 4X,U4I pieces of evidence using a mixed method of direct observation and hemerographic analysis. As a result, the few mentions of a[ected people and health personnel in front page information is evident, as is the predominance of news journalistic genres (brief and news, especially), and the political \gures as the most represented actors shows a high degree of politicization of the global crisis. Finally, it is observed that the visual frames in the analyzed newspapers tend to promote humanization through emotional representation. © (2023), All Rights Reserved."

"The genetic information expressed through the development of a sequencing model for DNA/RNA proteins using Machine Learning Algorithms is a big exploration and growing need. Basically, this was intended to identify, predict as well as classify gene families based on the DNA sequence with medical anomalies for early diagnosis of genetic variation. This study assessed gene sequences from three DNA sequence text files, including 4380 human, 1682 chimpanzee, and 820 dog DNA. The genetic disorder dataset includes 35 features that were utilized to predict genetic abnormalities across 22083 patient data. Labelling, correlating, exploratory data analysis, and prediction systems were made for both datasets. Prediction systems were made using Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, and SVC Classifier algorithms. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier achieved the best accuracy rate of 94.42% for DNA sequencing dataset, followed by K Neighbour Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and SVC Classifier contributed 71.98%, 74.85%, 86.82% and 79.6% respectively. For the genetic disorder dataset, the best-performing model was CatBoost with a 54.72% R2CV score. As for the R2CV scores, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Gradient Boosting Classifier offered 47.36%, 34.16%, 45.27%, 40.83%, 52.36%, 48.89%, 48.75% and 53.34% respectively. Genetic disorders will be classified in the future based on extensive medical history, sequence data, deep learning models, federated machine learning and transfer learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This article explores the concept of embodied memory in literary fiction and aims to illustrate some of the many angles from which it can be examined. After reviewing three different approaches to understanding embodied personal memory, it argues in line with contemporary perspectives on embodiment and 4E cognition (Caracciolo and Kukkonen) that a combined approach of cognitive and more traditional perspectives on the concept has significant benefits for analyzing embodied memories in literary texts. A case study of Lincoln in the Bardo (2017) is presented to illustrate these claims in practice. The analysis shows that a medial or symbolic approach to embodied memory cannot contain the novel’s complex bodies on its own and that a cognitive perspective adds an analytic layer which is essential to forming an understanding of its personal as well as collective mechanics of remembrance.

"The concept of sustainable tourism development is derived from sustainable development. Building tourism with the framework of sustainable development has become a necessary effective way. This study examined the abstracts and titles of 1783 sustainable development and 692 sustainable tourism development related papers from 2012 to 2021 as textual data sources through the Web of Science core database. Using text mining and semantic network as analysis methods, this paper summarizes eight main clusters of sustainable development and sustainable tourism development in the past 10 years. Based on this, this paper compares the differences between the two researches and explores four potential research areas in sustainable tourism development: (1) threats to sustainability; (2) ecology and health; (3) stakeholder cooperation and roles; and (4) tourism development planning. In addition, the visual network knowledge structure intuitively captures the relationship between the different keywords in the clustering, which provides an important reference value for broadening the future research direction of sustainable tourism development. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Intracranial multimodal monitoring (iMMM) is increasingly used for neurocritical care. However, concerns arise regarding iMMM invasiveness considering limited evidence in its clinical significance and safety profile. We conducted a synthesis of evidence regarding complications associated with iMMM to delineate its safety profile. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42021225951) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis and Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines to retrieve evidence from studies reporting iMMM use in humans that mention related complications. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and funnel plots. The primary outcomes were iMMM complications. The secondary outcomes were putative risk factors. Of the 366 screened articles, 60 met the initial criteria and were further assessed by full-text reading. We included 22 studies involving 1206 patients and 1434 iMMM placements. Most investigators used a bolt system (85.9%) and a three-lumen device (68.8%), mainly inserting iMMM into the most injured hemisphere (77.9%). A total of 54 postoperative intracranial hemorrhages (pooled rate of 4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0–10%; I 2 86%, p < 0.01 [random-effects model]) was reported, along with 46 misplacements (pooled rate of 6%; 95% CI 1–12%; I 2 78%, p < 0.01) and 16 central nervous system infections (pooled rate of 0.43%; 95% CI 0–2%; I 2 64%, p < 0.01). We found 6 system breakings, 18 intracranial bone fragments, and 5 cases of pneumocephalus. Currently, iMMM systems present a similar safety profile as intracranial devices commonly used in neurocritical care. Long-term outcomes of prospective studies will complete the benefit-risk assessment of iMMM in neurocritical care. Consensus-based reporting guidelines on iMMM use are needed to bolster future collaborative efforts. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society."
"Online platforms have revolutionized the way we access and consume music, offering vast libraries of content at our fingertips. These platforms serve as vital bridges, facilitating thousands of daily sales and enabling direct connections between artists and their fans. However, the sheer volume of music available presents us with new and unique challenges. In this study, we present a method of classifying music using the phonemes present in the individual lyrics of the songs. It focuses on the use of these phonemes to predict genre or emotional labels from the Million Song Dataset project. The results show that utilizing phonemes achieves similar accuracy to utilizing lyrics as features. Additionally, combining comprehensive lyric representations with the phoneme approach yields marginally superior results, suggesting potential for further exploration. This research suggests delving deeper into identifying the most valuable predictive phonemes and their connection to emotions, which may lead to an optimized set of features for modeling. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The paper examines Leonid Leonov’s novel “The Russian Forest” (1950–1953). The aim of the study is to explore the specific features of the author’s metaphors that form the basis of the novel poetics. The author’s task is to present the key image of the novel as a constructive text element in the light of the aesthetic parameters and stylistic principles of the writer. The article presents a scholarly research of the problem under consideration. The author examines the spiritual and symbolic orientation of associations, which determines the originality and structure of Leonov’s metaphorical phraseologisms. The author’s metaphors, being the most important elements of the writer-philosopher’s individual style, make up the semantic axis of the symbolic-realistic, nationally colored worldview. The author suggests an interpretation of the artistic space of the “The Russian Forest” from the perspective of the modern concept of metaphor and the idea of the fractal dimension of the narrative, which connects the principles of religious culture and the philosophy of literature. Fractal theory is used as a potential model of studying the system of novel tropes. Metaphors and metaphorical similes dominate the range of novel expressive means. Metaphor is an intensive component of Leonov’s symbolically-realistic language. Two worlds are brought together with the help of the author’s metaphors in “The Russian Forest”: man and nature. The metaphors-personifications, the title metaphor, the metaphorical dialogic utterances, and the fragments of the text created on this basis (narration about events, memories of the childhood of the main character, dialogues and monologues, insert episodes) considered in the article organize the ideological and artistic framework of the work. The article provides examples of important compositional parts of the novel: an introductory lecture by Ivan Vikhrov and a fragment of Gratsiansky’s secret notes. Attention is paid to the technique of graphical highlighting of words essential for the expression of the author’s meanings. The results of the analysis can be used in the practice of teaching Russian literature of the 20th century, lectures and seminars in the theory and history of literature in universities, in the reading for school essays. The article is aimed to develop interest in the creative work of one of the brightest representatives of philosophical prose in the literary process of the second half of the last century. The interpretation of “The Russian Forest” as a philosophical novel with a rich metaphorical potential outlines a promising line of study of Leonov’s creative activity. © 2023 Ural State Pedagogical University.

"This study is built upon a behavior-based framework for real-time attention evaluation of higher education learners in e-reading. Significant challenges in AI model developments for learning analytics have been 1) defining valid indicators and 2) connecting the analytics results to interventions, balancing the generalization and personalization needs. To address this, we utilized a public multimodal WEDAR dataset and trained a neural network model based on real-time features of learners, aiming at predicting learners' moment-to-moment distractions. Real-time features for model training include 30 learners' attention regulation behaviors annotated every second, reaction times to blur stimuli, and page numbers indicating various reading phases. Our preliminary model based on a neural network has achieved 66.26% accuracy in predicting self-reported distractions. Based on the model, we suggest a framework of a Behavior-based Feedback Loop for Attentive e-reading (BFLAe). It has text blur as feedback, a mechanism responsive to learners' distractions that also works as data for next-round feedback. The general feedback implementation rules are established on a statistical analysis conducted on all learners. In addition, we propose a strategy for personalizing feedback using a quartile analysis of individual data, promoting learner-specific feedback. Our framework addresses the high demand for an automated e-learning assistant with non-intrusive data collection based on real-world settings and intuitive feedback provision. The feedback system aims to help learners with longer attention spans and less frequent distractions, leading to more engaging e-reading. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Flight parameter data plays a crucial role in comprehensively capturing the operational characteristics of various aircraft components and recording essential flight status information. This data holds significant value and finds extensive application in the domains of aircraft repair, maintenance, support, troubleshooting, and system optimization. However, due to the vast number of parameters present in flight record bus data and the generation of massive datasets at the gigabyte level, direct extraction becomes challenging. Therefore, it is necessary to filter the flight parameter data to enable efficient utilization for targeted problem analysis. This paper proposes an auxiliary method for analyzing flight parameter data using multi-text clustering and multi-timescale alignment. Additionally, an automated tool is designed and developed to address the complexities of synchronizing and concatenating parameters across multiple data buses, facilitating the effective extraction of flight parameter data and unlocking its true value. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"In recent times, pre-training models of a large scale have achieved notable success in various downstream tasks by relying on contrastive image-text pairs to learn high-quality visual general representations from natural language supervision. However, these models typically disregard sentiment knowledge during the pre-training phase, subsequently hindering their capacity for optimal image sentiment analysis. To address these challenges, we propose a sentiment-enriched continual training framework (SECT), which continually trains CLIP and introduces multi-level sentiment knowledge in the further pre-training process through the use of sentiment-based natural language supervision. Moreover, we construct a large-scale weakly annotated sentiment image-text dataset to ensure that the model is trained robustly. In addition, SECT conducts three training objectives that effectively integrate multi-level sentiment knowledge into the model training process. Our experiments on various datasets, namely EmotionROI, FI, and Twitter I, demonstrate that our SECT method provides a pre-training model that outperforms previous models and CLIP on most of the downstream datasets. Our codes will be publicly available for research purposes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"High-dimensional datasets manifest as r-separable matrices in a wide range of applications such as hyperspectral imaging, text mining, astronomy, and archetypal analysis of scientific imaging data. In this work, we consider the problem of reconstructing high-dimensional r-separable matrices from their compressive and noiseless linear measurements. We propose to exploit the convex geometry and latent sparsity of r-separable matrices to pose their desketching from compressive measurements as a constrained nonconvex optimization. The resulting nonconvex optimization is then solved as a sequence of reweighted convex optimizations, each of which is solved individually using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We conduct extensive numerical experiments with synthetic datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed iterative procedure in desketching high-dimensional r-separable matrices and inferring their convex geometry from their compressive and noiseless linear measurements. © 2023 IEEE."
"Large pre-trained language models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in producing high-quality text via prompting techniques. This fact introduces new possibilities for data collection and annotation, particularly in situations where such data are scarce, complex to gather, expensive, or even sensitive. In this paper, we explore the potential of pre-trained language models to generate and annotate goal-oriented dialogues, and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate their quality. Our experiments employ ChatGPT, and encompass three categories of goal-oriented dialogues (task-oriented, collaborative, and explanatory), two generation modes (interactive and one-shot), and two languages (English and Italian). Through extensive human-based evaluations, we demonstrate that the quality of generated dialogues is on par with those generated by humans. On the other side, we show that the complexity of dialogue annotation schema (e.g., for dialogue state tracking) exceeds the capacity of current language models, a task which still requires substantial human supervision. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Knowledge extraction and reuse are critical topics for manufacturing companies willing to strengthen their Product-Service Systems (PSS) offerings. In manufacturing’s maintenance processes, effectiveness and efficiency depend on the ability to learn from past field interventions. Dealing with unstructured descriptions of maintenance activities has prevented manufacturing companies from analyzing them, causing the loss of useful information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) demonstrated high potential, allowing simplified text knowledge extraction and summarization. Besides, the literature presents only a few applications of topic modeling for maintenance improvement in the manufacturing domain. Using a case study, the paper demonstrates the potentialities of NLP adoption to improve not only the maintenance management and execution but also the asset design and management, impacting the whole PSS. In other words, implications will have effects on the operational (e.g. maintenance execution), managerial (e.g. maintenance management), and business levels (e.g. PSS offering definition) of manufacturing firms. © 2023 The Author(s).

"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that has affected not only the health sector but also economic, social, and psychological well-being. Individuals are using social media platforms to communicate their feelings and sentiments about the pandemic. One of the most debated topics in that regard is the vaccine. People are divided mainly into two groups, pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine. This article aims to explore Arabic Sentiment Analysis for Vaccine-Related COVID-19 Tweets (ASAVACT) to quantify sentiment polarity shared publicly, and it is considered the first and the largest human-annotated dataset in Arabic. The analysis is done using state-of-the-art deep learning models that proved superiority in the field of language processing and analysis. The models are the stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU), the stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (SBi-GRU), and the ensemble architecture of SGRU, SBi-GRU, and AraBERT. Additionally, this article presents the largest Arabic Twitter corpus on COVID-19 vaccination, with 32,476 annotated Tweets. The results show that the ensemble model outperformed other singular models with at least 7% accuracy enhancement. © 2023 Alhumoud et al. Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0.

"The purpose of these meta-analyses was to examine the effectiveness of home-based interventions aimed at improving literacy and mathematics outcomes for preschool-age children (mean age = 4.29 years; range = 3.07–5.32 years) and to develop an understanding of what home-based interventions work in different contexts. A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria for these meta-analyses; 30 studies included sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analyses, and two studies did not contain sufficient quantitative data and instead were summarized in a narrative review. The average weighted effect size for interventions with literacy (d = 0.10; CI = [−0.17, 0.38]; n = 27) and mathematical outcomes (d = 0.18; CI = [−1.62, 1.99]; n = 8) were minimal. Hence, these meta-analyses showed that home-based interventions had minimal effect on literacy and mathematical outcomes for preschoolers. There were more home-based interventions with literacy (N = 28) than mathematical outcomes (N = 10). The heterogeneity showed no variability, indicating that all intervention impacted on children’s outcomes to similar effect. Overall, many interventions were relatively light touch (i.e., time spent engaging in parent training), and the engagement requirement of the parent in some studies was minimal (e.g., reading a short text message). More in-depth research into the components of interventions (e.g., focus, training approaches) and evaluation of interventions before they are implemented is essential for ensuring that early interventions will be effective and lead to the development of the intended skills. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Aim: Maternal drinking (alcohol use during pregnancy/motherhood) is a hidden public health concern which can have significant negative effects on the woman and child. This pilot survey explored several domains that might influence maternal drinking. Subject and methods: Two cross-sectional, online surveys recruited (1) women who were pregnant and (2) mothers who were not pregnant. Surveys captured data on alcohol use and harmful drinking, attitudes on and motives for drinking/not drinking, and perceived barriers to drinking less. Content analysis of free text responses complemented quantitative data. Results: In this convenience sample of 836 pregnant women and 589 mothers, 91% of pregnant women and 28% of mothers reported abstinence. Of those reporting alcohol use, median consumption was 2.3 units/week in pregnant women, and 6.9 units/week in non-pregnant mothers. Of mothers currently drinking, 25.1% reported hazardous or harmful levels. Heavier drinking was associated with numerous motives, including using alcohol as a coping strategy. Child welfare was a key motivating factor for not drinking, as were practical issues of motherhood. The stresses of motherhood were a perceived barrier to reducing drinking, and mothers reported more barriers than pregnant women. Conclusion: Stress reduction motives may be a risk factor for heavier maternal drinking, while motives for not drinking seem to be focused on child welfare and maternal well-being. Stress and a lack of knowledge about how to reduce drinking appear to be barriers for mothers to change their drinking behaviour. These findings can inform the development of effective public health interventions to reduce maternal drinking. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The study aimed to explore knowledge about the shared culture between Thailand and Indonesia, the story of Garuda and batik traditions, and develop a new cultural product that represents the two cultures visually in the form of batik based on the findings. Samples were determined purposively from the Mother-Inlay-Pearl doors of the Emerald Buddha Temple at the Grand Palace Bangkok and the Semen Agung Sawat Garuda batik from the collection of King Chulalongkorn. This qualitative-descriptive and comparative study used a compositional interpretation approach to analyze the symbolic meaning of visual styles and text semiotics. The analysis could help develop batik with the Dua Negeri concept based on previous studies, batik expert interviews, and visual experiments. The idea is that one piece of batik displays visual styles from two countries. This study showed that Indonesia and Thailand have a shared culture influenced by Hindu Buddhism due to trade, culture, diplomacy, and kinship relations. Both countries have batik traditions, and each has a distinctive visual style. Therefore, the proposed new Dua Negeri batik design is expected to enrich the batik repertoire in both countries and strengthen cultural relations by respecting each other’s cultures. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This paper investigates the temporal dynamic of Korean Wave (also known as Hallyu) as an online entertainment consumption and emotions experienced in the first five-month period during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused cities across the globe to regulate restrictions of social distancing and mobility. Previous studies suggest that city lockdowns may lead to public health problems due to restriction on human interaction. This study aims to examine the changing pattern of online entertainment consumption and how it was impacted by consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses Google’s trend data to examine the dynamics of search terms and Natural language processing (NLP) model using twitter’s text data to analyse cultural consumption and emotional analysis.

"Wearable robots involve human&#x2013;robot interactions, and capturing the electrical energy from human dynamics during interactions is gaining increasing interest. However, previous studies have not thoroughly investigated the maximum mechanical energy and the efficiency of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion between robotic prostheses and humans. In this study, the effects of motor rotation speed <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\omega _{\text{mo}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) duty cycle <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$D$</tex-math></inline-formula>, replacing <sc>mosfet</sc> and replacing a motor on efficiency <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\eta$</tex-math></inline-formula> were investigated through theoretical analysis, a bench test, and walking experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 5). The theoretical analysis involved studying the energy flowchart during the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion using a bench test. Then, walking experiments were conducted and the results showed that replacing a motor led to a 6&#x0025; and 10&#x0025; increase in energy regeneration at 1.3 and 1.1&#x00A0;m/s (self-selected), respectively. Based on the efficiency obtained from a bench test and walking experiments, the maximum mechanical power for a robotic prosthesis was obtained and ranged from 4.35 to 8.23 W, which showed the possibility of a 100&#x0025; self-charged-powered robotic prosthesis. This study presents a feasible approach to analyze and improve the efficiency of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion between robots and humans. IEEE"
"What if a new Masaccio were found? This article offers a 16th century ekphrasis of a “lost” Masaccio so ornate, funny, and lusty that it upends prior conceptions of the artist. I examine this description and two others, all by the comic writer Anton Francesco Grazzini (“Il Lasca,” 1503-1584), to see how art could be leveraged within Florence's literary and artistic culture as class commentary. I have located in Florence two of the works of art that clearly motivated Grazzini's literary portraits and, by analyzing Grazzini's texts in relation to these and other possible inspirations, I reveal his associative view of Florence, one that links upper-class, humanist concerns with lower-class stereotypes. What emerges is a Florence with boundaries removed: in Grazzini's words, the material and literary fabric of the city are knitted together in a new way, one that elides eras as it conjures the visions, sounds, and even tastes of Florence's carnival streets. My analysis suggests why Grazzini may have wanted such juxtapositions, and will show that while his vision is fantastic, it is grounded in identifiable, even material, cultural production. © 2023 Society for Renaissance Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

"Recent advancements in voice conversion and text-to-speech technology have facilitated the creation of musical deepfakes, audio tracks featuring the voices of celebrity artists - typically without the artists' involvement. Several deepfakes have already gone viral, leaving the music industry scrambling to sort out the potential impacts. While the media have primarily focused on specific high-profile incidents, there has been less attention from journalists and researchers surrounding the broader trends in musical deepfakes, including the communities creating them, the modeling techniques that they employ, and the sites on which they congregate. In this paper, we investigate two leading sources of musical deepfake models, the AI Hub Discord server and the Uberduck website, which are dedicated to the training, utilization, and distribution of these deepfakes. Interestingly, musical deepfakes target hundreds of artists of different backgrounds, levels of success, and musical styles. In light of the economic, legal, and ethical issues raised by deepfakes of so many artists, we provide warnings about the generation of discriminatory forms of content and potential financial and contractual problems for artists. We recommend more research should be conducted in this area, especially to probe peoples' perceptions of this technology and devise approaches that mitigate potential harms. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

"The rapid growth of radio broadcast services has created a vast amount of audio data that can provide insights into public opinion and emotions. This research extends the boundaries of sentiment analysis to audio data and aims to propose a computational approach which is termed as bifurcate and mix, for sentiment analysis and emotion detection that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques from audio sentiment analysis tools like Vokaturi, transcription services like AssemblyAI and text sentiment analysis lexicons like VADER to extract and categorize sentiments from the audio data to generate a more efficient real-time sentiment analysis model. The results of the analysis reveal patterns and trends in the sentiments expressed in radio broadcasts by the News Service Division: All India Radio-'Akashwani'. This research's methodology will contribute to the development of novel applications for sentiment analysis in the media industry and provide valuable insights into public opinion and emotions.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Tangut studies is a broad discipline, generally consisting of three branches: Tangut language and literature, Tangut archaeology, and Tangut history. There are three new trends in Tangut studies in the new century: the publication of more Tangut written sources and artifacts, the gradual standardization of the interpretation of Tangut texts, and the continuous expansion of the subfields of Tangut historical research. Some issues could potentially hinder the further development of Tangut studies, such as cultivating new scholars in Tangut studies, avoiding the problem of “fragmentation” in research, supplementing the Khara-Khoto material, and the cooperation between Tangut studies and Tibetan studies. Finally, some future work plans are mentioned that cover various aspects, including language and literature, Tangut documents, and historical research. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"In the era of big data and ubiquitous internet connectivity, user feedback data plays a crucial role in product development and improvement. However, extracting valuable insights from the vast pool of unstructured text data found in user feedback presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by combining the Contextualized Topic Model (CTM) and the Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Language Understanding (MPNet) model. Our approach aims to create a more accurate and context-aware topic model that enhances the understanding of user experiences and opinions. To achieve this, we first search for the optimal number of topics, focusing on generating distinguishable, general, and unique topics. Next, we perform hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model and maximize coherence metrics. The result is an exceptionally effective model that outperforms established topic modeling methods, including LSI, NMF, LDA, HDP, NeuralLDA, ProdLDA, ETM, and the default CTM, achieving the highest coherence CV score of 0.7091. In this study, the combination of CTM and MPNet has proven highly effective in the context of user feedback topic modeling. This model excels in generating coherent, distinguishable, and highly relevant user feedback topics, capturing the nuanced nature of user feedback data. The topics generated from this model include 'Music and Audio Streaming,' 'Application Performance,' 'Banking, Financial Services, and Customer Support,' 'User Experience,' 'Other Topics,' 'Application Content,' and 'Application Features.' Our contributions include a powerful tool for developers to gain deeper insights, prioritize actions, and enhance user satisfaction by incorporating feedback into future product iterations. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset as an open-source resource for further exploration and validation of user feedback analysis techniques and general natural language processing applications. With our proposed approach, we strive to drive business success, improve user experiences, and inform data-driven decision-making processes, ultimately benefiting both developers and users alike.  © 2023 The Authors."
"Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between the Chief Executive Officer's (CEO) overconfidence and financial reporting complexity in Iran, a context characterized by weak corporate governance and heightened managerial discretion. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 1,445 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2021. CEO overconfidence (CEOOC) is evaluated using an investment-based index, specifically capital expenditures. Financial reporting complexity (Complexity) is measured through textual features, particularly three readability measures (Fog, SMOG and ARI) extracted from annual financial statements. The ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is employed to test the research hypothesis. Findings: Results suggest that CEOOC is positively related to Complexity, leading to reduced readability. Additionally, robustness analyses demonstrate that the relationship between CEOOC and Complexity is more distinct and significant for firms with lower profitability than those with higher profitability. This implies that overconfident CEOs in underperforming firms tend to increase complexity. Also, firms with better financial performance present a more positive tone in their annual financial statements, reflecting their superior performance. The findings remain robust to alternative measures of CEOOC and Complexity and are consistent after accounting for endogeneity issues using firm fixed-effects, propensity score matching (PSM), entropy balancing approach and instrumental variables method. Research limitations/implications: This study adds to the literature by delving into the effect of CEOs' overconfidence on financial reporting complexity, a facet not thoroughly investigated in prior studies. The paper pioneers the use of textual analysis techniques on Persian texts, marking a unique approach in financial reporting and a first for the Persian language. However, due to the inherent challenges of text mining and feature extraction, the results should be approached with caution. Practical implications: The insights from this study can guide investors in understanding the potential repercussions of CEOOC on financial reporting complexity. This will assist them in making informed investment decisions and monitoring the financial reporting practices of their invested companies. Policymakers and regulators can also reference this research when formulating policies to enhance financial reporting quality and ensure capital market transparency. The innovative application of textual analysis in this study might spur further research in other languages and contexts. Originality/value: This research stands as the inaugural study to explore the relationship between CEOs' overconfidence and financial reporting complexity in both developed and developing capital markets. It thereby broadens the extant literature to include diverse capital market environments. © 2023, Javad Rajabalizadeh."
"Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are known to cause hospitalisation, longer hospital stays, as well as higher healthcare costs and mortality. Unrecognised ADRs are anticipated throughout the medicine lifecycle as, before the medicine reaches the market, clinical trials are conducted for a short period on a limited number of people, who might underrepresent the actual population. After the medicine reaches the market, emergent information that could affect its benefit-to-risk balance is usually shared by regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies through medicine risk communications. Medicines risk communications aim to prevent harm to patients by targeting their behaviour, knowledge, and attitudes, as well as those of health care professionals (HCPs). Despite their important role in translating these communications into their clinical practice, HCPs do not always adhere to the recommendations provided in risk communications. Measurement of medicine risk communications' effectiveness does not necessarily guarantee their implementation, cost-effectiveness, or transferability in real-world situations. To enhance the impact of drug regulatory interventions, implementation science has been encouraged. However, implementation science was not previously used to identify factors affecting HCPs' implementation of medicines risk communications. A recently widely used framework is the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). In this systematic review, the TDF was employed to categorise a range of different factors that could affect HCPs’ implementation of medicine risk communications within their clinical contexts. Methods: The search strategy involved a set of predefined search terms and fifteen databases, such as EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL PLUS. Searches were conducted from April to May 2018 and updated in June 2021 using PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL PLUS. A second reviewer independently conducted the screening process of the initial search. The total number of records screened was 10,475. A study was included if it reported any factors influencing HCPs' uptake of medicine risk communications. Only studies with English or Arabic abstracts were included. Those studies that did not include pharmacovigilance-related medicine risk communications were excluded. Additionally, studies only assessing HCPs' practice or evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures were excluded. Likewise, studies related to occupational hazards, case reports, interventional studies, and studies not involving HCPs were excluded. In case the published information was insufficient to decide whether to include or exclude a study, the authors were contacted. Furthermore, the authors of seven eligible abstracts were contacted for full-text articles. The mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. All included studies were assessed by one reviewer, and a total of 16 studies were assessed by two reviewers independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Using thematic analysis and concept mapping, a narrative synthesis was performed, followed by a critical reflection on the synthesis process. This review presents the results of the concept mapping, which involved matching the identified factors to the TDF. Results: A total of 28 studies were included. Eleven domains influenced HCPs' implementation of medicine risk communications. A large number of studies included factors related to the “Knowledge” domain (n = 23), followed by “Beliefs about Consequences” (n = 13), “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes” (n = 12) and “Environmental Context and Resources” domains (n = 12). Seven studies reported “social influences” and six studies included factors relating to “Goals”, followed by four studies involving factors related to “Social/Professional Role and Identity”. Underrepresented domains included “Emotion” (n = 2), “Beliefs about Capabilities” (n = 2), “Behavioural Regulation” (n = 1), and “Reinforcement” (n = 1). On the other hand, none of the identified factors were related to the “Skills”, “Optimism”, or “Intentions” domains. Except for “Beliefs about Consequences”, most studies contributing to the other three most commonly reported domains (“Knowledge”; “Environmental Context and Resources”; and “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes”) scored low (1 or 2 out of 5) on the MMAT quality assessment. Moreover, the same number of studies (n = 5) contributing to the “Beliefs about Consequences” domain had low (1 or 2 out of 5), and intermediate (3 out of 5) scores on the MMAT. Conclusion: Medicines risk communications are important tools for disseminating information that may influence the benefit-to-risk balance of medicines. Even though HCPs are required to implement the recommendations of these communications, they do not always adhere to them. Using the TDF enabled the categorization of the range of factors that affect whether or not HCPs implement the recommendations provided in a medicine risk communication. However, most of these factors relate to four domains only (“Knowledge”; “Beliefs about Consequences”; “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes”; and “Environmental Context and Resources”). Additionally, most of the studies contributing to three of these four domains were of low quality. Future research should focus on using implementation science to identify target behaviours for actionable medicine risk communications. Regulators should use such science to develop cost-effective strategies for improving the implementation of medicines risk communication by HCPs. © 2023"
"Recent years have seen a rise in the use of video sensors in remote sensing (RS) as they represent a rich source for understanding earth dynamics and human activities. Accordingly, the volume of RS video data has rapidly increased. Accessing a video of interest from large repositories through text-to-video retrieval is preferable due to its flexibility and efficiency. In this letter, we propose a text-to-event retrieval model for aerial videos. The architecture of our model consists of two branches. The first is the video branch that extracts frame-level features from the video by using the vision transformer (ViT). Then, these features are concatenated into a unified representation and fed into a temporal attention module to incorporate the temporal aspects. The second branch is the text branch that extracts textual representations from the query by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The two branches are trained jointly on video and text pairs by minimizing a bidirectional contrastive loss. Experimental results on the CapERA dataset, which is an extension of the event recognition in aerial video (ERA) dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The dataset will be available at http://www.github.com/yakoubbazi /CapEra. IEEE"
"This essay responds to scholarship on nineteenth-century representations of Christopher Columbus, by reinscribing Haitian writing on Columbus into transnational approaches largely focused on the US and Latin America. Throughout this essay, I contend that Émile Nau’s Histoire des caciques d’Haïti (1854) was profoundly influenced by Washington Irving’s A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus (1828). In particular, I show how Nau reframed Irving’s text in nationalist terms to reimagine Columbus as the catalyst of modernity while asserting the centrality of Haiti to his life. To do so, I compare key passages in Nau and Irving to reconstitute Nau’s enigmatic methodology and to show how Nau adapted Irving’s text to inscribe Columbus within his vision of Haitian history that included the Spanish colonization of Hispaniola. This analysis reveals the ways in which Haitian cultural nationalism drew from and spoke back to the larger network of nineteenth-century Atlantic nationalisms. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Sentiment analysis (SA) and text emotion detection (TED) are two computer techniques used to analyze text. SA categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral opinions, while TED can identify a wide array of emotional states, allowing an automated agent to respond appropriately. These techniques can be helpful in areas such as employee and customer management, online support, and customer loyalty, where identifying human emotions is crucial. Among other approaches, research has been conducted using machine learning (ML) algorithms, and labeled datasets have been created to train these models. Current state-of-the-art research for supervised ML algorithms reports good performance for TED (approximately 80% accuracy) and even better results for SA (above 90%). After conducting an extensive review of 30 surveys, the primary objective of this manuscript is to point out that most of these articles (94%) focus heavily on comparing the applied computational methods (the algorithm). At the same time, relatively diminished attention is paid to three other critical factors, namely the selection of an appropriate emotion model (mentioned only in 23% of cases), the corpora utilized for training (30%), and the data source employed during analysis and evaluation (20%). The lack of standardization across these essential elements presents a significant challenge when performing meaningful performance comparisons among algorithms. Consequently, the absence of a unified framework for comparison hampers the practical implementation of SA and TED techniques within mission-critical scenarios within real-world mission-critical scenarios.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The rapid proliferation of social media data has led to the widespread dissemination of multi-modal fake news, prompting researchers to develop novel detection methods. Most fake news detection approaches mine the rich context information, including the text and image content of news and associated comments. However, existing methods are often insufficient to filter out irrelevant contexts, such as noisy words, redundant image regions, and spam comments, which may introduce noise into the model. Particularly, these approaches struggle to handle comments, which often contain the most severe noise. In many cases, only a minuscule portion of comments is relevant to the news. To overcome these limitations, our research introduces a novel Comment-Context Dual Collaborative Masked Transformer Network (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$C^{2}DCMTN$</tex-math></inline-formula>). To handle the irrelevant contexts, we propose a Multi-modal Masked Transformer Network. This network extends the traditional Transformer with a mask mechanism capable of dynamically obscuring irrelevant multi-modal context information. To effectively deal with comments, which can suffer from more severe noise issues, we have designed a Comment-Context Encoder that focuses solely on the most crucial comments. Comprehensive experiments on two publicly available real-world datasets confirm that <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$C^{2}DCMTN$</tex-math></inline-formula> outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

"In this study, we present a novel microwave annealing (MWA) technique that exploits the electromagnetic loss of metal electrodes as a heat source to enhance the performance of multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) field-effect transistors (FETs) on flexible plastic substrates without inflicting thermal damage. We employed COMSOL-based temperature distribution analysis to understand the compatibility of our MWA process with flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates operating within a low thermal budget. Electrical characterizations, including mobility, contact and channel resistances, subthreshold slope, and trap density, were used to validate the effectiveness of our annealing process, with the results indicating significant improvements. Furthermore, by modulating the thickness of the electrode overlay, we demonstrated the possibility of achieving distinct annealing temperatures for different materials in the same experimental batch at an identical power level, thereby enhancing annealing efficiency. Moreover, when compared to traditional thermal annealing, our method showed superior performance in terms of enhanced electrical properties and reduced annealing time. IEEE"
"Purpose: This study aims to explore the use of time series analyses to examine changes in travelers’ preferences in accommodation features by disentangling seasonal, trend and the COVID-19 pandemic’s once-off disruptive effects. Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal data are retrieved by online traveler reviews (n = 519,200) from the Canary Islands, Spain, over a period of seven years (2015 to 2022). A time series analysis decomposes the seasonal, trend and disruptive effects of six prominent accommodation features (view, terrace, pool, shop, location and room). Findings: Single accommodation features reveal different seasonal patterns. Trend analyses indicate long-term trend effects and short-term disruption effects caused by Covid-19. In contrast, no long-term effect of the pandemic was found. Practical implications: The findings stress the need to address seasonality at the single accommodation feature level. Beyond targeting specific features at different guest groups, new approaches could allow dynamic price optimization. Real-time insight can be used for the targeted marketing of platform providers and accommodation owners. Originality/value: A novel application of a time series perspective reveals trends and seasonal changes in travelers’ accommodation feature preferences. The findings help better address travelers’ needs in P2P offerings. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This article investigates the operation principle and dispersion properties of the co-planar slow wave structure (SWS). The SWS exhibits an additional phase shift of 2<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pi $</tex-math> </inline-formula> seen by the electrons, owing to its physical configuration. The backward wave mode is the fundamental mode, naturally conducive to the backward wave oscillation. To analyze the characteristic properties of the SWS, an equivalent circuit model is proposed, considering models of the transmission lines and discontinuities. The theoretical calculation results are in good agreement with the simulations. Moreover, a design of the SWS at <italic>V</italic> band is proposed with a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$-$</tex-math> </inline-formula>15-dB <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\textit{S}_{\text{11}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> frequency range from 0 to 70 GHz.

The results show that the proposed SWS has a tunable frequency range of 17 GHz and a maximum output power of 60 W at 69.5 GHz. In addition, the proposed SWS is fabricated using microfabrication techniques and the S-parameters are measured with the probe station. The developed SWS has the characteristics of wide bandwidth and high coupling impedance, which is suitable for the application of millimeter-wave BWO. IEEE"
"In recent decades, refugee immigration has had significant impact on educational contexts in Sweden, with preschools the primary arenas for young children’s language learning experiences. The present study examines second language and literacy training practices for immigrant children (aged 1–5) in preschools in Sweden. The empirical data consist of video recordings of teacher-guided play activities. These were designed to create rich linguistic and cultural environments facilitating active and democratic participation by the children. Guided play activities were developed in close collaboration between teachers and researchers during action-based interventions that were aimed at constructing child-oriented participatory language learning practices in ethnically and linguistically diverse ECEC settings. The children’s first languages were Tigrinya, Arabic dialects, Somalian, Kurdish dialects, Russian, Spanish and Swedish. The participatory learning potential of guided play was collaboratively analyzed and assessed, and new and revised activities were implemented, based on the goals of inclusivity and children’s active engagement in play and language learning. The analysis shows that teachers’ use of multimodal semiotic means, such as questions, texts and cultural artifacts (stories, material story-related objects, play spaces) were important strategies for the preparation of appealing play environments and activities that contributed to children’s curiosity and participation. These resources served as affordances for guided play, allowing the simultaneous scaffolding of children’s play competencies and their language learning. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Correction to: Nature Neuroscience, published online 25 May 2015. In the version of the article initially published, there were errors in the main text and Supplementary Figures; original and updated figures are shown in the Supplementary Information accompanying this amendment. The published β3-tubulin blots shown in Fig. 1b are in error. When preparing Fig. 1b, copies of the vWF blots were incorrectly placed into the positions labeled for β3-tubulin. The raw original blots for vWF and β3-tubulin were correctly included in Supplementary Fig. 14. We have replaced the β3-tubulin blots in Fig. 1b using their correct raw original blots as shown originally in Supplementary Fig. 14. The PICALM blot in Fig. 1b for microvessel-depleted brain samples is in error, as is its corresponding raw original blot shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. An incorrect blot scan was mistakenly used for the microvessel-depleted brain PICALM blots in Fig. 1b. We also made a mistake in Supplementary Fig. 14, as the corresponding raw original blot for PICALM microvessel-depleted brain was incorrect. The PICALM microvessel-depleted brain blot in Fig. 1b and corresponding full blot in Supplementary Fig. 14 have been updated with the correct PICALM blot. We also performed a quantification analysis with the new correct microvessel-depleted brain PICALM blots used to correct Fig. 1b, and obtained results similar to those originally reported in Fig. 1c. We have updated the graph in Fig. 1c. Therefore, this correction did not change the overall results of Fig 1b,c or scientific conclusions of the paper. There are mismatches between Fig. 7i (the Rab 11 blot), the Fig. 7l,m blots, and their corresponding original blots shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. These mismatches may have occurred because one of our investigators included versions of these blots from different replicate experiments for the published Fig. 7i,l,m. To avoid confusion, we replaced the mismatched blots in Fig. 7i,l,m with the original blots taken from Supplementary Fig. 14. This correction did not change the results of Fig. 7i,l,m or scientific conclusions of the paper. Full blots for Fig. 2b were inadvertently omitted from Supplementary Fig. 14, which has been updated to include these blots. Also, there was some confusion whether the dashed boxes marking the blots in Supplementary Fig. 14 reflected the approximate locations of the bands cropped for presentation in Fig. 5i. We have updated the locations of the dashed boxes in Supplementary Fig. 14 to better reflect the approximate band locations. Importantly, these errors did not affect the results or scientific conclusions of the paper in any way. The authors sincerely apologize for these inadvertent errors.

"Advances in data accessibility and analytical methods opened new frontiers for comparative studies of European legislative activities. However, these advances still need to be fully harnessed by legislative scholars for multiple reasons. We provide an overview of extant research agendas to identify these reasons and explore the opportunities for tapping the potential of big data and quantitative text analysis. We present significant data collection efforts, such as ParlSpeech, the Comparative Agendas Project and CLARIN, and highlight their respective value for, primarily, large-N comparative research focusing on European Union member states and the European Union itself. Our review highlights the most consequential gaps in the literature and shortcomings of available data and analysis. These include the lack of extensive historical and geographical coverage, missing harmonisation and cross-linking between separate efforts, no unified speech and document (bill, law) databases, and the unavailability of good-quality full-text variables. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The representation of gays and lesbians on Chilean television has increased steadily over the last decades. This paper offers an analysis of the role these images had in the processes of sexual identification of a sample of 25 members of the audience who identify as gays or lesbians. Through a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews, it is shown that the respondents believed that the televisual representations of homosexuality have contributed to further marginalize gay and lesbian lives. This strengthened damaging feelings that fed into a sense of shame that was originating from multiple institutions and texts, thus complicating their processes of self-recognition and self-acceptance during their childhood and adolescence. Taking examples of how participants described their relationship with these representations and the ways in which they circulated socially, it is argued that they could only articulate their identification as gays or lesbians by disassociating themselves from these images and establishing a clear difference in regard to them. This was in a process in which several other informational and experiential opportunities came into play, which allowed them to resignify the categories gay/lesbian and lead less conflictive processes of identification. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

"The paper describes and analyses the concept of the in-flight passenger entertainment systems considering categorization of the systems and the features for different passenger class as well as the length of flight. On the basis of the synthesis, the paper proposes enhancement and optimization of the passenger equipment and service system, applying most recent virtual reality technology and ChatGPT. Our experiments indicate that virtual reality technology has the potential to improve the experiences of passengers. However, due to the limited space in economy class plus the installation and maintenance costs, it may be less interesting to install it in economy class. For ChatGPT, it has great potential to be added to IFE systems, as it can provide information and recommendations for entertainment options, answer general personalized questions, offer language translation, and provide accessibility features etc. ChatGPT could be very beneficial to both economy and business classes for both long/short-distance flights when a voice-to-text interface is available. © 2023 Kaunas University of Technology.

"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) decreases the life expectancy and quality of life of diabetics and causes economic and societal problems. For this purpose, diabetes self‑management education and support (DSMES) has been designed for many years, which is recently provided through technology‑assisted education. Therefore, we developed a web‑based program in accordance with DSMES to assess its effect on self‑care behaviors and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for patients with T2DM during the coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic, which is described in detail in this paper. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed on 70 diabetic patients in Al‑Zahra Hospital for three months. After random allocation, web‑based educational content (including videos, lectures, educational motion graphics, text files, educational posters, and podcasts) according to DSMES was provided for the intervention group to improve self‑care behaviors and HbA1c levels. The control group received routine educational pamphlets. A diabetes self‑management questionnaire (21 questions) with a Likert scale was completed to assess self‑care behaviors scores before and after intervention and three months later. Also, HbA1c was determined before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance with repeated measurements will be applied to compare mean scores of self‑care behaviors components three times, and an independent t‑test analyzed mean differences of HbA1c values. CONCLUSION: The obtained results of this study might be useful for promoting self‑care behaviors and assessing HbA1c in diabetic patients. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Aspect-Based Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a rapidly growing field in sentiment analysis. While most research has focused on processing the ASTE task either in a pipeline or end-to-end manner, both methods have their limitations. Pipeline methods may accumulate errors in practical applications, while sequence labeling methods in end-to-end approaches may overlook important feature information of the three elements themselves. Additionally, various features in sentences and emotional word markers have not been effectively explored in these methods. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution called Span Tagging Multi-Channel Graph Convolutional Network (STMC-GCN) that explicitly combines multiple prominent features to extract span-level sentiment triplets, where each span may consist of multiple words and play different roles. Specifically, we designed a three-channel graph fusion model that converts sentences into multiple channels of graphs. These channels extract node text features, centrality features, and position features, which are then extracted through cross-channel convolution operations to obtain a common graph representation shared by different channels. To optimize downstream classification with better results, we use consistency and difference constraints to enhance common attributes and independence. Finally, we explore span-level information and constraints to generate more accurate aspect-based sentiment triplet extractions. Experimental results illustrate that STMC-GCN performs well on multiple datasets, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Introduction: Cancer currently occurs in about 1 in 1000 pregnancies. Both active malignancy and pregnancy are individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The purpose of this systematic review/meta-analysis was to evaluate the rate of VTE in pregnant patients with active malignancy compared with pregnant patients without malignancy. Material and methods: Embase, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Database, and clinicaltrial.gov were search by a trained librarian from inception until June 2021, and limited to English and French language human studies using keywords related to pregnancy, neoplasm, and thrombosis. This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021245886). Title, abstract, and full-text review was performed using the Covidence data management system. Two authors reviewed the studies independently. Of the 3821 articles screened, seven cohort studies were included that reported VTE rate in patients with active malignancy in pregnancy. Results: A total of 5928 individuals had active malignancy and pregnancy. Active malignancy in pregnancy significantly increased the odds of a VTE (odds ratio [OR] 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8–12.1). Specifically, patients with thyroid (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3–6.3), cervix (OR 6.6, 95% CI 2.4–18.0), or other gynecological (OR 10.6, 95% CI 4.4–25.8) cancers; Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 8.7, 95% CI 3.3–23.4); or acute leukemia (OR 17.1, 95% CI 10.9–26.8) all had increased odds, whereas those with brain cancer (OR 6.1, 95% CI 0.4–98.2), breast cancer (OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.3–17.4), malignant melanoma (OR 5.5, 95% CI 0.3–88.1), or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 3.2, 95% CI 0.8–12.9) malignancies did not have statistically significant increased odds for VTE. No studies reported whether prophylactic anticoagulation was used during pregnancy in this population; nor did they report timing in pregnancy of the VTE. The absolute risk for VTE in those with active malignancy was 0.9% compared with 0.2% in those without active malignancy in pregnancy. Conclusions: Pregnancy with active malignancy confers a significant increased risk for VTE compared with pregnancy alone. Given this finding, prophylactic anticoagulation during pregnancy and postpartum could be considered in this patient population. Data are underpowered to make firm recommendations per cancer type. © 2023 The Authors.

"The relevance of the study lies in the interest of modern humanities in the processes of the turn of the 20th century that are most expressively recorded on the pages of pre-revolutionary literary publications of the Russian Empire. The high intensity of events and interethnic communication in various spheres of life (culture, art, politics, economics) determined the shift of emphasis from the centers to the regions of the empire, from the covers of magazines to the pages of periodicals. In this regard, translated fiction acquires a special role. In many regions of the Russian Empire, along with the author's editorial texts, translated literature as a type of borrowed text acquired a number of functions and became one of the factors in the development of regional self-consciousness. The bibliography of translated literature in the newspaper Kavkaz (1885-1918) is used as a research material. From the very beginning, Kavkaz became one of the main periodicals in the region. Firstly, it was the main conductor of the Caucasian text in Russian and Russian-speaking culture, both within the region and beyond. Secondly, due to its active work and influence on readers and the political, cultural and historical processes common to the state, the newspapers caused the reverse vector of intercultural, interethnic and interlingual mediation gradually, i.e., the support of the integration of the peoples of the Caucasus into the multicultural whole of the Russian state. In Kavkaz, local literature in Russian had a more multifac-eted communicative space, and its information fields were filled with cultural, educational, political and ideological components. However, translated literature invariably took its place on the pages of the newspaper. The aim of this article is to identify the strategy of the literary policy of the newspaper Kavkaz from the perspective of the imagological approach to translated literature. The main objectives are the quantitative description and analysis of the corpus of translated literature in 1885-1918. To reach the aim, the authors used methods of modern literary criticism, translation studies, and journalism. As a result, the study of the first collected corpus of publications of translated literature on the pages of Kavkaz from 1884 until the end of its publication showed the validity of the hypothesis about the program status of this content due to the acquisition of functions associated with the imagological aspect, in particular the morphogenesis of cosmopolitanism with a dominant European trend, and also metamorphoses of classical or regional artistic, aesthetic and moral taste under the influence of external literary sources. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"Various algorithms exist for the audio deep fake synthesis, such as deep voice, tacotron, fastspeech, and imitation techniques. Despite the existence of various spoofing speech detectors, they are not ready to distinguish unseen audio samples with high precision. In this study, we suggest a robust model, namely Ensemble Deep Learning based Detector (EDL-Det) to detect text-to-speech (TTS) and categorize it into spoofed and bonafide classes. Our proposed model is an improved method based on YAMNet employing VGG19 as a base network instead of MobileNet combined with two other deep learning(DL) methods. Our proposed system effectively analyzes the mel-spectrograms generated from input audio to extract the better artifacts underlying the audio signals. We have added an ensemble learning block that consists of ResNet50, and InceptionNetv2. First, we convert speech into mel-spectrograms that consist of time-frequency representations. Second, we train our model using the ASVspoof-2019 dataset. In the end, we classified the audios converting them into mel-spectrograms using our trained binary classifier along with a majority voting scheme by three networks. Due to deep convolutional network architecture, our proposed model effectively extracts the most representative features from the mel-spectrograms. Furthermore, we have performed extensive experiments to assess the performance of the suggested model using the ASVspoof 2019 corpus. Additionally, our proposed model is robust enough to identify the unseen spoofed audios and accurately classify the attacks based on cloning algorithms. Authors"
"The article aims to identify memorable gastronomic experiences reported online and verify their relationships with the type of cuisine served and restaurant location. This study used text mining, LDA, Pearson’s chi-squared test and sentiment analysis. All 48,378 English reviews posted by TripAdvisor users concerning 155 restaurants in Krakow were scraped. Eight features that characterise MGEs were identified (service/staff, atmosphere, cuisine/food (taste), drinks, local specialities, location/setting, price & value and table booking). There are statistically significant differences in the frequency of the topic experiences depending on the location of restaurants in the city. © 2023, Polska Akademia Nauk. All rights reserved."
"Pre-training serves as a foundation of recent NLP models, where language modeling tasks are performed over large texts. Typical models like BERT and GPT take the corpus as a whole and treat each word equally for language modeling. However, recent works show that the naturally existing frequency bias in the raw corpus may limit the power of the language model. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that gradually increases the training vocabulary by modifying the training data. Specifically, we leverage the syntactic structure as a bridge for infrequent words and replace them with the corresponding syntactic labels, then we recover their original lexical surface for further training. Such strategy results in an easy-to-hard curriculum learning process, where the model learns the most common words and some basic syntax concepts, before recognizing a large number of uncommon words via their specific usages and the previously learned category knowledge. Experimental results show that such a method can improve the performance of both discriminative and generative pre-trained language models on benchmarks and various downstream tasks. IEEE"

"Automatic dubbing, which generates a corresponding version of the input speech in another language, can be widely utilized in many real-world scenarios, such as video and game localization. In addition to synthesizing the translated scripts, automatic dubbing further transfers the speaking style in the original language to the dubbed speeches to give audiences the impression that the characters are speaking in their native tongue. However, state-of-the-art automatic dubbing systems only model the transfer on the duration and speaking rate, disregarding the other aspects of speaking style, such as emotion, intonation and emphasis, which are also crucial to fully understand the characters and speech. In this paper, we propose a joint multiscale cross-lingual speaking style transfer framework to simultaneously model the bidirectional speaking style transfer between two languages at both the global scale (i.e., utterance level) and local scale (i.e., word level). The global and local speaking styles in each language are extracted and utilized to predict the global and local speaking styles in the other language with an encoder-decoder framework for each direction and a shared bidirectional attention mechanism for both directions. A multiscale speaking style-enhanced FastSpeech 2 is then utilized to synthesize the desired speech with the predicted global and local speaking styles for each language. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms a baseline with only duration transfer in objective and subjective evaluations. IEEE"
Person re-Identification（person re-ID）technique aims to solve the problem of association and matching of target person images across multiple cameras within a camera network of a surveillance system，especially in the case of face，iris and other biometrics recognition failure under non-cooperative application scenarios，and has become one of the key component and supporting technique for intelligent video surveillance systems and applications in intelligent public security and smart cities. Recently，person re-ID has attracted more and more attention from both academia and industry，and has made rapid development and progress. To meet the requirement of its technical challenges and application needs of person re-ID in practical scenarios，this paper will first give a brief introduction to the development history，commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Then，the recent progress in hot research topics of person re-ID is extensively reviewed and analyzed，which includes：occluded person re-ID，unsupervised person re-ID，virtual data generation，domain generalization，cloth-changing person re-ID，cross-modal person re-ID and person search. First，to address the problem of impact of possible occlusions on the performance of person re-ID，recent progress in occluded person re-ID is first reviewed，in which the popular datasets for occluded person re-ID are briefly introduced，and the two major categories of occluded person re-ID models are then further reviewed. Second，facing the challenges of low-efficiency and high-cost data annotation and great impact of training data on the performance of person re-ID，unsupervised person re-ID and virtual data generation for person re-ID emerges as two hot topics in person re-ID. The paper elaborates the recent advances of unsupervised person reID，which can be classified into three major categories：pseudo label generation-based models，domain transfer-based models，and other related models，which take into consideration of the extra information like time-stamps，camera labels besides person image. Third，the-state-of-the-art works on virtual data generation for person re-ID are reviewed，with detailed introduction and performance comparisons of major virtual datasets. Fourth，recent researches on domain generalization person re-ID will be reviewed，which are classified into five categories：batch/instance normalization models，domain invariant feature learning models，deep-learning-based explicit image matching models，models based on mixture of experts and meta-learning-based models. Fifth，since most current person re-ID models largely depend on the color appearance of persons’clothes，clothes-changing person re-ID becomes a challenging setting，in which person images can exhibit large intra-class variation and small inter-class variation. Typical cloth-changing person re-ID datasets are introduced and the recent researches will then be reviewed，in which models in the first category explicitly introduces extra cloth-appearance-independent features like contour and face while the second try to decouple the cloth features and person ID features. Sixth，to compensate the drawbacks of conventional person re-ID of visible light/RGB images in natural complex scenes like poor lighting conditions in the night，the-state-of-the-art of cross-modal person re-ID，which aims to resolve the problem through other visible RGB images-excluded heterogeneous data，are reviewed，with a brief introduction of commonly used cross-modal person re-ID datasets first and then four sub-categories models according to the different modalities employed，including：RGB-infrared image person re-ID，RGB image-text person re-ID，RGB image-sketch person re-ID，and RGB-depth image person re-ID，respectively. Seventh，since existing person re-ID benchmarks and methods mainly focus on matching cropped person images between queries and candidates and is different from practical scenarios where the bounding box annotations of persons are often unavailable ，person search，which jointly considers person detection and person re-ID in a single framework，becomes a new hot research topic. The typical datasets and recent progress on person search are reviewed. Finally，the existing challenges and development trend of person re-ID techniques are discussed. It is hoped that the summary and analysis can provide reference for relevant researchers to carry out research on person re-ID and promote the progress of person re-ID techniques and applications. © 2023 Journal of Image and Graphics.

"The aim of the paper is a presentation of the content and of the results of the phonemicgraphemic analysis of the German records from the first decade of the second half of the 14th century, which come from the town council of Zgorzelec (Görlitz). The records form a part of the first book of records of the town Zgorzelec. The aim of the article is to answer the question what the spelling rules in the town chancellery of Zgorzelec are and how the script fixes the features of the spoken language from the past. Due to the analysis, it could be explicitly proved, that the German used in the text matches to the level of evolution of the German language within the periodization of history of the language as it contains the standard Early New High German features as well as the dialectal structures and the sound changes, which are typical for the Silesian dialect. The text can therefore be classified as one of the linguistic monuments of the East Central German of Silesian tradition. All the conclusions of the study are supported with the suitable examples. © 2023, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu Szczecinskiego. All rights reserved."
"The exponential increase in textual unstructured digital data creates significant demand for advanced and smart stemming systems. As a preprocessing stage, stemming is applied in various research fields such as information retrieval (IR), domain vocabulary analysis, and feature reduction in many natural language processing (NLP). Text stemming (TS), an important step, can significantly improve performance in such systems. Text-stemming methods developed till now could be better in their results and can produce errors of different types leading to degraded performance of the applications in which these are used. This work presents a systematic study with an in-depth review of selected stemming works published from 1968 to 2023. The work presents a multidimensional review of studied stemming algorithms i.e., methodology, data source, performance, and evaluation methods. For this study, we have chosen different stemmers, which can be categorized as 1) linguistic knowledge-based, 2) statistical, 3) corpus-based, 4) context-sensitive, and 5) hybrid stemmers. The study shows that linguistic knowledge-based stemming techniques were widely used for highly inflected languages (such as Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu) and have reported higher accuracy than other techniques. We compare and analyze the performance of various state-of-the-art TS approaches, including their issues and challenges, which are summarized as research gaps. This work also analyzes different NLP applications utilizing stemming methods. At the end, we list the future work directions for interested researchers.  © 2013 IEEE."
"This paper examines how the Bangladeshi online media argues the country’s bilateral relations with bigger states by examining the media coverage on China, Japan, the US, and India. Methodologically, the study was conducted by combining quantitative text mining and qualitative analysis using the pentagonal model. The result shows that the Bangladeshi media publishes mostly economic related issues relating to each bigger state in line with the relationships based on investment, infrastructure, manufacture and exports between them and Bangladesh. In addition, comments on what Bangladesh expects to gain from bigger states are also observable. While Bangladesh faces various political and security issues with each of the bigger states, the media narrative is that the government is actively addressing these issues with the political motivation to enhance economic development, proactively engaging in balanced diplomacy while avoiding being passive and disadvantaged vis-à-vis the bigger states. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Summarization is a challenging task that aims to generate a summary by grasping common information of a given set of information. Text summarization is a popular task of determining the topic or generating a textual summary of documents. In contrast, image summarization aims to find a representative summary of a collection of images. However, current methods are still restricted to generating a visual scene graph, tags, and noun phrases, but cannot generate a fitting textual description of an image collection. Thus, we introduce a novel framework for generating a summarized caption of an image collection. Since scene graph generation shows advancement in describing objects and their relationships on a single image, we use it in the proposed method to generate a scene graph for each image in an image collection. Then, we find common objects and their relationships from all scene graphs and represent them as a summarized scene graph. For this, we merge all scene graphs and select part of it by estimating the most common objects and relationships. Finally, the summarized scene graph is input into a captioning model. In addition, we introduce a technique to generalize specific words in the final caption into common concept words incorporating external knowledge. To evaluate the proposed method, we construct a dataset for this task by extending the annotation of the MS-COCO dataset using an image retrieval method. The evaluation of the proposed method on this dataset showed promising performance compared to text summarization-based methods.  © ; 2023 The Authors."
"Purpose: Financial reports are the basis of economic decisions that affect organizational interests and shareholders. However, there is a severe research gap concerning the factors affecting the quality of financial information (such as audit report readability and tone). Therefore, considering the importance of presenting high-quality financial information, this study aims to investigate the impact of intellectual capital (IC) and its components on the audit report's readability and tone. Design/methodology/approach: The multivariate regression model tests research hypotheses. Then, hypotheses are tested via a sample of 824 observations of the listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange (103 companies) from 2014 to 2021, using the multivariate regression model based on pooled data and fixed effects. Findings: Results determine that customer capital (CC) and structural capital (SC) are likely to influence the audit report tone positively. In general, the IC and human capital (HC) negatively impact auditors' tone. More analyses also document that IC and its CC, HC and SC components positively and significantly affect audit report readability based on two readability indices, including FOG and text length. Finally, findings pertaining to the third readability index (Flesch index) reveal that only HC and SC are robust based on this measurement, whereas the IC and CC have a negative and significant impact on the readability of auditors’ reports. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to address this issue in emerging markets, and it provides helpful insights for users, analysts and legal institutions regarding IC, which significantly affects audit report readability and tone. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Abstract: The article aims to analyze the discursive transformations of social justice to realize social welfare during five successive administrations in the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1981 to 2021. It analyzes institutional texts and official speeches by the presidents of each administration based on the discourse analysis method of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. The findings demonstrate that each government differently articulated the signifier of justice in its social policies. However, the central signification was tied to ‘poverty eradication’ in all five administrations. However, social justice was not considered a comprehensive discourse nor an inclusive strategic process, but rather was defined discursively by each government as a government-oriented project in a short-term perspective, mainly by reducing social justice to economic growth and redistribution of resources. Finally, according to the comprehensive discourse of the Islamic Revolution, I suggest the need to redefine social justice as the aim of realizing social welfare in Iranian society with regard to the comprehensive, multi-dimensional definition of justice which include: (1) equal access to resources and opportunities by providing backgrounds, range and scope for such opportunities; (2) considering the principle of entitlement and necessities; and (3) attention to redistributive justice and expansion of the government’s sup portive umbrella by focusing on the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups (social, physical and mental). © 2023 Editors of Middle East Critique."
"Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between psychoanalytic metapsychology and the somatic background of lived experience, in order to explore the question of the place of creation in the current psychic process. It is based on the hypothesis that the work of integrating subjective experience recorded at the somatic level presupposes the creation of a form compatible with psychic functioning. Methodology: It is therefore based on a specific methodology for research into metapsychological modeling, the main thrust of which consists in trying to identify not just one particular statement, but above all the process of theorization that can be identified throughout Freud's texts. In this sense, it is presented as a “clinical theory.” The analysis of the process of theorization, while of course focusing on the propositions that Freud spells out in his texts, is above all centered on an analysis of their sequence, and hence of a certain form of associativity. This method of reading, based on a consideration of the associativity of the texts, assumes the hypothesis of a “transference” from Freud to the “metapsychological witch,” a transference that testifies to the fact that Freud is continuing the self-analytical work begun in the Interpretation of Dreams. For our purposes here, this methodology is epistemologically supported by both work and research from developmental psychology and in certain statements from the neurosciences. Results: In order to articulate psychoanalytic metapsychology more closely to the somatic background of subjective experience, it is necessary to deconstruct the hypothesis of a perception-consciousness system – a hypothesis born of an illusion of the ego in relation to the speed of cerebral processes – in order to emphasize that perception is a somatic process that is highly organized by the complexity of the cerebral operations that determine its form. Giving perception back its place in the soma also requires us to change our conception of the drive, the thrust of which cannot be separated from the impact of subjective experience on the subject's life. Finally, this paradigmatic inflection allows us to delve deeper into the role and function of the ego's core-envelopes, highlighting their dialectic role in the creation of forms compatible with psychic functioning. Discussion: The challenge of the paradigmatic evolution thus implied is to open the way to a new consideration of the archaic processes that are very active in a whole series of narcissistic suffering. It should thus open the way to a type of construction-reconstruction work on early experiences and their impact on the rest of psychic development, but also on traumatic experiences that have many points in common with them. Conclusion: Metapsychology is alive and evolving under the pressure of both clinical and neuroscientific developments, as well as the evolution of our knowledge in early developmental psychology (and in fetal psychology). Thanks to this evolution, it seems increasingly necessary and heuristic to perfect its articulation with the biological basis of human functioning. © 2023"
"In this paper, we study the (sparse) Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP), which arises in a number of modern statistical learning models, such as principal component analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), Fisher&#x0027;s discriminant analysis (FDA) and sliced inverse regression (SIR). We provide the first study on GEP in the differential privacy (DP) model under both deterministic and stochastic settings. In the low dimensional case, we provide a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\rho$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Concentrated DP (CDP) method namely DP-Rayleigh Flow and show if the initial vector is close enough to the optimal vector, its output has an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-norm estimation error of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{n}+\frac{d}{n^{2}\rho })$</tex-math></inline-formula> (under some mild assumptions), where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$d$</tex-math></inline-formula> is the dimension and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$</tex-math></inline-formula> is the sample size. Next, we discuss how to find such an initial parameter privately. In the high dimensional sparse case where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$d\gg n$</tex-math></inline-formula>, we propose the DP-Truncated Rayleigh Flow method whose output could achieve an error of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\tilde{O}(\frac{s\log d}{n}+\frac{s\log d}{n^{2}\rho })$</tex-math></inline-formula> for various statistical models, where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$s$</tex-math></inline-formula> is the sparsity of the underlying parameter. Moreover, we show that these errors in the stochastic setting are optimal up to a factor of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{Poly}(\log n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> by providing the lower bounds of PCA and SIR under the statistical setting and in the CDP model. Finally, to give a separation between <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>-DP and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\rho$</tex-math></inline-formula>-CDP for GEP, we also provide the lower bound <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Omega (\frac{d}{n}+\frac{d^{2}}{n^{2}\epsilon ^{2}})$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Omega (\frac{s\log d}{n}+\frac{s^{2}\log ^{2} d}{n^{2}\epsilon ^{2}})$</tex-math></inline-formula> of private minimax risk for PCA, under the statistical setting and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>-DP model, in low and high dimensional sparse case respectively. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data support our previous theoretical analysis. IEEE"
"This paper presents <italic>Sim-Suction</italic>, a robust object-aware suction grasp policy for mobile manipulation platforms with dynamic camera viewpoints, designed to pick up unknown objects from cluttered environments. Suction grasp policies typically employ data-driven approaches, necessitating large-scale, accurately-annotated suction grasp datasets. However, the generation of suction grasp datasets in cluttered environments remains underexplored, leaving uncertainties about the relationship between the object of interest and its surroundings. To address this, we propose a benchmark synthetic dataset, <italic>Sim-Suction-Dataset</italic>, comprising 500 cluttered environments with 3.2 million annotated suction grasp poses. The efficient <italic>Sim-Suction-Dataset</italic> generation process provides novel insights by combining analytical models with dynamic physical simulations to create fast and accurate suction grasp pose annotations. We introduce <italic>Sim-Suction-Pointnet</italic> to generate robust 6D suction grasp poses by learning point-wise affordances from the <italic>Sim-Suction-Dataset</italic>, leveraging the synergy of zero-shot text-to-segmentation. Real-world experiments for picking up all objects demonstrate that <italic>Sim-Suction-Pointnet</italic> achieves success rates of 96.76&#x0025;, 94.23&#x0025;, and 92.39&#x0025; on cluttered level 1 objects (prismatic shape), cluttered level 2 objects (more complex geometry), and cluttered mixed objects, respectively.

"Dynamically monitoring and analyzing evolving real-world events (riots, earthquakes, and football matches) using publicly available short texts (social media posts) is becoming increasingly important. This content can hold critical information about various events, which can help decision-makers to make better decisions. Significant research efforts have been made in this regard. However, most of these provide solutions based on black-box engines, in which technical capabilities are required to understand their internal mechanics. Also, they offer very little information about the detected events and generally tend to answer very high-level questions, such as: 'what are the main topic clusters?' 'what are the main words (e.g. top ten words) of these topics?'. These challenges can limit their usage in some critical domains, where the need for transparency, and more information, to analyze a particular situation is crucial. Thus, to complement and fill the gap in the direction of existing studies, in which the effectiveness and success of the proposed approaches are insufficiently determined by their performance scores, this paper presents datasets that can be used for dynamic topic detection of different frequencies over time based on real Tweets and a new transparent method for the dynamic event detection problem called Self-Evolving Contextual Analysis (SECA). It helps to answer, for any given time frame, other fundamental questions, such as: 'what are the sub-topics of, and their relationship to, a topic (or a sub-topic?)', 'what are the changing topics and sub-topics?', 'what are the new trends?', 'what are the topics no longer being discussed?' and most importantly, 'why and how have these topics and changes been identified and generated?'. Moreover, Performance and Carbon Footprint assessments reveal the comparative effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, this paper presents a practical implementation of SECA to dynamically analyze tweets collected during the FIFA World Cup 2022 Final Match.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Move analysis is a primary research topic in computational linguistics that relates to pragmatics. It plays a crucial role in analyzing the intent and coherence of the text. This paper introduces a innovative exploration of move analysis to scientific papers and presents a novel task - move structure recognition in scientific papers. Existing datasets are inadequate to support this task. Thus, we manually annotated a dataset called Scientific Abstract Moves Dataset (SAMD). The implicit mixture and counterfactual reasoning in the move structure’s content has led to poor performance in move recognition. This research examines the issue in depth and presents a new concept of move saliency attribution, which can illuminate the contribution of words to specific move structures. On this foundation, we design a new move recognition training mechanism, which fully consider the context information of the move to achieve promising performance on SAMD and NLPContributionGraph shared task dataset (NCG). This is the first attempt at interpretability of move recognition, giving us the possibility to understand how the model makes decisions and identify potential biases or errors in the model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

"As more and more netizens participate in financial market transactions, online discussions on asset price movements are becoming more comprehensive and timely. Online text, especially from social media, has the potential to be an important data source for financial opinion mining. Market sentiment analysis mainly includes direct analysis methods in the form of text-based surveys and indirect inference methods based on structured data such as price, trading volume, and volatility. In theory, the former is helpful for us to understand investor sentiment earlier, but due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of objective survey samples, its obtained research attentions are far less than the latter. To combine the advantages and offset the weakness of these two approaches, this paper uses Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to construct social media sentiment indexes based on plenty of daily discussion texts about Bitcoin (BTC) and S &P500 (SPX) from Reddit for analyzing their interaction with prices. We also propose a new time series synchronization verification method called Rolling Time-lagged Cross-correlation (RTLCC) surface, and corresponding feature constructing methods, in which RTLCC helps us observe Time-lagged Cross-correlation from the perspective of Rolling Correlation while determining the hyperparameters (Window Size & Time Offset) for features construction. Finally, based on these features, we use four machine learning classifiers for modeling and verify the effectiveness of the proposed market sentiment analysis pipeline, in which on the prediction of 10-day price movements, the best model achieves 89.9% in accuracy (ACC) and 92.5% in AUC. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"The article is an attempt to analyse the qualities of airspace captured in the lyrical texts inspired by Chagall’s works and to outline their atmospheres and moods. The subject of the interpretation are the poems by Johannes Bobrowski, Rose Ausländer, Ulrich Grasnick, Joanna Kulmowa and Tadeusz Kubiak, which refer directly to Chagall’s works or evoke his poetic worlds, exposing mainly the scene of love flight. Reflections are not only made on the material airspace in which the lovers float, but also on the affective atmosphere that envelops them, in which the transmission of affects is possible and which in turn unfolds a transpersonal intensity. Methodologically, the analysis moves in the field of ‘atmospheric’ literary and cultural studies, which are non-representational approaches working to accentuate and deepen problems that the atmosphere as a diffuse and ephemeral background poses, as well as to examine how it is composed and organised and what meaning that has. © 2023, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu Szczecinskiego.

"In this article, we develop a methodological approach for organizational research regarding the construction of multidimensional and relational similarity measures by using the vector space model in natural language processing (NLP). Our vector space approach draws on the well-established premise in organizational research that texts provide a window into social reality and allow measuring theory-based constructs (e.g., organizations’ self-representations). Using a vector space approach allows capturing the multidimensionality of these theory-based constructs and computing relational similarities between organizational entities (e.g., organizations, their members, and subunits) in social spaces and with their environments, such as the organization itself, industries, or countries. Thus, our methodological approach contributes to the recent trend in organizational research to use the potential inherent in big (textual) data by using NLP. In an example, we provide guidance for organizational scholars by illustrating how they can ensure validity when applying our methodological contribution in concrete research practice. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The existing image-to-video translation methods generally follow a frame-by-frame generative paradigm, while extracting the temporal information from a reference video or an audio stream. Inspired by the recent success in text-guided image generation, we explore a more challenging but promising task, Text-guided Image-to-Video (TI2V) translation. Given an image and a brief text description as input, TI2V aims to generate a facial expression video following the image and text. To this end, we first propose an automatic video captioning pipeline to generate dense textual descriptions for facial video datasets, using both expression labels and action units. These dense textual descriptions provide precise semantic guidance for TI2V learning. Then we design and train an efficient framework, FaceCLIP, on these datasets to deal with the TI2V translation task. FaceCLIP adopts a video autoencoder to model the temporal information of training videos, and a pretrained CLIP model to embed the video frames and the text description. We design a reconstruction loss and an embedding alignment loss to train the autoencoder to obtain the text-guided video generative ability. Recognizing that expressions are closely tied to facial landmark motions, the reconstruction loss is applied to facial landmarks rather than each video frame, significantly enhancing training efficiency. We compare FaceCLIP with several potential baseline methods, and extensively evaluate the performance using multiple metrics. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the superiority of FaceCLIP in terms of both visual quality and expression-text consistency. Moreover, the unique ability of FaceCLIP to generate videos based on abstract texts demonstrates its stronger generalization capability. IEEE"
"Despite the increasing use of digital media data in communication research, a central challenge persists–retrieving data with maximal accuracy and coverage. Our investigation of keyword-based data collection practices in extant communication research reveals a one-step process, whereas our cross-disciplinary literature review suggests an iterative query expansion process guided by human knowledge and computer intelligence. Hence, we introduce the WordPPR method for keyword selection and text data retrieval, which entails four steps: 1) collecting an initial dataset using core/seed keyword(s); 2) constructing a word graph based on the dataset; 3) applying the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm to rank words in proximity to the seed keyword(s) and selecting new keywords that optimize retrieval precision and recall; 4) repeating steps 1–3 to determine if additional data collection is needed. Without requiring corpus-wide sampling/analysis or extensive manual annotation, this method is well suited for data collection from large-scale digital media corpora. Our simulation studies demonstrate its robustness against parameter choice and its improvement upon other methods in suggesting additional keywords. Its application in Twitter data retrieval is also provided. By advancing a more systematic approach to text data retrieval, this study contributes to improving digital media data retrieval practices in communication research and beyond. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"At the time of the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the beginning of the war in Croatia in 1991, the Balkans were not in the focus of Western politics, which was preoccupied with the collapse of the USSR and the Gulf War. The dominant position of Western policy was the preservation of Yugoslavia and the maintenance of geopolitical stability. In the second half of 1991, under the influence of the war in Croatia, Western policy slowly turned towards the possibility of the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the recognition of the independence of Slovenia and Croatia. The article analyzes the American and British newspaper narratives about the war in Croatia during the five-month peak of the conflict, from Septem-ber 1991 to January 1992. The analysis was conducted on four daily newspapers, two American (The New York Times, Los Angeles Times) and two British (The Independent, The Guardian). A total of 920 texts were analyzed through coding based on the adoption of a pro-Croatian, pro-Serbian, or neutral position. The research shows that more texts about the war in Croatia were published in the analyzed British newspapers. Secondly, the narrative is significantly marked by a neutral stance, which coincides with the unclear and undefined policy of the West towards the Yugoslav crisis. Thirdly, there were significantly more pro-Croatian than pro-Serbian texts in the analyzed period. © 2023, Croatian Anthropological Society. All rights reserved."
"Stance detection on social media aims to identify if an individual is in support of or against a specific target. Most existing stance detection approaches primarily rely on modeling the contextual semantic information in sentences and neglect to explore the pragmatics dependency information of words, thus degrading performance. Although several single-task learning methods have been proposed to capture richer semantic representation information, they still suffer from semantic sparsity problems caused by short texts on social media. This article proposes a novel multigraph sparse interaction network (MG-SIN) by using multitask learning (MTL) to identify the stances and classify the sentiment polarities of tweets simultaneously. Our basic idea is to explore the pragmatics dependency relationship between tasks at the word level by constructing two types of heterogeneous graphs, including task-specific and task-related graphs (tr-graphs), to boost the learning of task-specific representations. A graph-aware module is proposed to adaptively facilitate information sharing between tasks via a novel sparse interaction mechanism among heterogeneous graphs. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, the extensive results exhibit that MG-SIN achieves competitive improvements of up to 2.1% and 2.42% for the stance detection task, and 5.26% and 3.93% for the sentiment analysis task, respectively.

"The abundance of user-generated online content has presented significant challenges in handling big data. One challenge involves analyzing short posts on social media, ranging from sentiment identification to abusive content detection. Despite recent advancements in pre-trained language models and transfer learning for textual data analysis, the classification performance is hindered by imbalanced data, where anomalous data represents only a small portion of the dataset. To address this, we propose Deep One-Class Fine-Tuning (DOCFT), a versatile method for fine-tuning transfer learning-based textual classifiers. DOCFT uses a one-class SVM-style hyperplane to encapsulate anomalous data. This approach involves a two-step fine-tuning process and utilizes an alternating optimization method based on a custom OC-SVM loss function and quantile regression. Through evaluations on four different hate-speech datasets, we observe that significant performance improvements can be achieved by our method. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Steganalysis is the process of detecting the presence of hidden information, such as a message or data, within another message or data. The goal of steganalysis is to identify the presence and type of steganography technique used to hide the information, which can be important for various applications, including law enforcement, intelligence gathering, and cyber security. Therefore, steganography techniques can thought of as hiding information in various types of media, such as images, videos, audio files, and even text data. While steganography techniques for media-based data, such as images and videos, have gained more attention in recent years, steganography for text data has been used for much longer. In fact, the concept of text steganography can be traced back to ancient Greece, where messages were hidden within wax tablets by writing them in between the lines of text. Text steganalysis techniques typically involve analyzing the statistical properties of the text, such as word frequency or character frequency distributions. Other techniques include analyzing the structure and syntax of the text, as well as performing linguistic analysis to identify patterns that may indicate the presence of hidden information. In this study, we shall perform a systematic study of the evolvement of traditional as well as contemporary techniques. The study will also reflect how generative artificial intelligence has impacted the quality of digital image steganography.  © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group."

"Musical caption, when expressed in free-form text as opposed to more structured and limited musical tags, often encompasses the individual characteristics of the annotator, thereby injecting a degree of subjectivity into the resultant dataset. This study explores the impact of such annotator subjectivity within the MusicCaps dataset, a pioneering collection of human-annotated captions explaining 10-second music audio clips. We conducted three distinct analyzes to investigate the presence of this subjectivity. This includes examining the frequency distribution of tag categories (i.e., genre, mood, or instruments) among different annotators, a qualitative assessment of caption embeddings through UMAP visualizations, and a quantitative analysis where we train and compare cross-modal retrieval models using an annotator-specified training split. Our findings underscore the significant annotator subjectivity inherent in the MusicCaps dataset, emphasizing the need for its consideration when collecting free-form text annotations on music or developing machine-learning models using this type of dataset. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

"Currently, individuals use online social media, namely Facebook or Twitter, for sharing their thoughts and emotions. Detection of emotions on social networking sites’ finds useful in several applications in social welfare, commerce, public health, and so on. Emotion is expressed in several means, like facial and speech expressions, gestures, and written text. Emotion recognition in a text document is a content-based classification problem that includes notions from deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) domains. This article proposes a Deer Hunting Optimization with Deep Belief Network Enabled Emotion Classification (DHODBN-EC) on English Twitter Data in this study. The presented DHODBN-EC model aims to examine the existence of distinct emotion classes in tweets. At the introductory level, the DHODBN-EC technique pre-processes the tweets at different levels. Besides, the word2vec feature extraction process is applied to generate the word embedding process. For emotion classification, the DHODBN-EC model utilizes the DBN model, which helps to determine distinct emotion class labels. Lastly, the DHO algorithm is leveraged for optimal hyperparameter adjustment of the DBN technique. An extensive range of experimental analyses can be executed to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the DHODBN-EC approach. A comprehensive comparison study exhibited the improvements of the DHODBN-EC model over other approaches with increased accuracy of 96.67%. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved."

"In recent years the field of Communication for Development and Social Change has been bibliometrically analyzed to identify the characteristic features of its scientific production. However, the previous studies have not incorporated the specific methodologies of bibliometrics and documentary research. This article fills that gap, by analyzing the keywords co-occurrence of CDCS scientific domain. The joint appearance of two or more representative words in fields such as article titles, abstracts, keywords, or free text is studied. Subsequently, the analysis is represented in word maps and networks, where the groups of words and the relationships between them are identified. The research questions of this work are the following: what are the texts of the sample, from which to carry out the indicated bibliometric analysis? What keywords are used to carry out the co-occurrence analysis and the graphic representation of this scientific domain? Given the trends identified, are we facing an emerging field or a field in the process of imploding? The conclusions point to the second term of this dilemma. We are witnessing an uncreative destruction of the field, to the extent that the fragile theoretical foundations from which this incipient field in Spanish communication research was beginning to rise have been demolished. © 2023 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas.

"This paper focuses on the task of product emotion cause analysis which aims to find essential causes of certain emotions from product reviews. Current works only study the explicit causes which are some spans in the given text. However, some crucial and useful causes may be expressed vaguely. They may not mention but can be inferred from the text semantics. They can capture the deeper reasons to explain some unknown phenomena, which can well support the applications like market research and product optimization. To address this problem, we in this paper propose a new task of Emotion Implicit Cause Discovery (EICD). We develop a novel method that can deduce the implicit causes based on the contexts and commonsense knowledge. Our method first retrieves related knowledge from the large language model to construct reasoning graphs for the emotions and potential causes. We then encode the structural knowledge in the graph and infer the implicit cause by deductive reasoning. To evaluate our method, we construct a large dataset called EICDset, based on Amazon product reviews. Experiments on it demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Genre categorization of published titles is a common practice in publishing houses, libraries, and bookstores, as well as a fundamental element of editorial marketing. However, assigning subject codes to each title proves to be an arduous task for both publishers and data aggregators. The problem with automatic genre categorization is that some publishers use more than 200 categories, making it a highly complex task. Moreover, even though these publishers based their categorization on standards, they ofthen alter the names of these standards as they consider to be too technical. In this paper, we proposed Thema-based categorization as a tool to facilitate editors' work by advancing the categorization process, allowing them to focus on finer category granularity. This categorization has four key features: first, it clusters the most important categories for Latin American publishers. Second, it stops grouping when the number of thematic categories remains practical for the purposes of the publishing business. Third, we assign names to these categories that resonate with Latin American stakeholders. Finally, the number of categories is optimized to provide reasonable classification performance. We worked on the description of books in Spanish of two publishers, and mapped them to this proposed categorization. This allowed us to created a database for train a model to automate categorization. After conducting our analysis, we determined that 26 thematic categories were an appropriate number that fulfilled the three features mentioned earlier. However, we recognized that classifying into 26 categories was still a complex task, so to overcome this challenge, we decided to augment data by back-translating it into Spanish using the translation function, TlS S, where TSl is the translation function from Spanish, s, to language, l; Tls is the translation function from language, l, to Spanish, S, and TSl and TlS are not-invertible functions. Experimental results, obtained using 5-fold cross-validation, were approximately 57%, 57%, 63.38%, and 65.26% for the F1-score of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logist Regression (LR), BERT, and RoBERTa models, respectively. We utilized the F1-score metric because our categories were not perfectly balanced. The results achieved by RoBERTa outperform those reported in the literature. Furthermore, these results are built upon the foundation of the Thema standard for categorizing book genres. Additionally, the categories have been specifically designed to align with the preferences and needs of Latin American publishers.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Nowadays, up-to-date information is endlessly generated by online users; however, sometimes, information on the internet often needs a lot of time to read by readers. Therefore, tools like automatic text summarization are especially important today. Although Indonesian is one of the most used languages in the world, its research in abstractive automatic text summarization is very limited compared to other languages like English and Mandarin. Recently, many pre-trained models for NLP have been developed and are able to generate abstractive automatic text in the English language. Recently, using data augmentation in NLP has also gained a lot of interest; according to research, applying data augmentation in the training set can improve the performance of NLP downstream tasks such as aspect-based sentiment analysis and machine translation. Thus, this research tries to augment the Indonesian news dataset, Liputan6, using the backtranslation method, which will be used to train and fine-tune mT5, mBART, and IndoBART model to generate Indonesian abstractive automatic text summarization task, then compare the result of the summarization and ROUGE score with the models trained and fine-tuned using non-augmented Liputan6 datasets. The result shows that models that are trained with the augmented Liputan6 dataset gained an increase in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®"
"Deep learning-empowered semantic communication is regarded as a promising candidate for future 6G networks. Although existing semantic communication systems have achieved superior performance compared to traditional methods, the end-to-end architecture adopted by most semantic communication systems is regarded as a black box, leading to the lack of explainability. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a novel semantic communication system with a shared knowledge base is proposed for text transmissions. Specifically, a textual knowledge base constructed by inherently readable sentences is introduced into our system. With the aid of the shared knowledge base, the proposed system integrates the message and corresponding knowledge from the shared knowledge base to obtain the residual information, which enables the system to transmit fewer symbols without semantic performance degradation. In order to make the proposed system more reliable, the semantic self-information and the source entropy are mathematically defined based on the knowledge base. Furthermore, the knowledge base construction algorithm is developed based on a similarity-comparison method, in which a pre-configured threshold can be leveraged to control the size of the knowledge base. Moreover, the simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of transmitted data size and sentence similarity. IEEE"
"Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to determine the sentiment polarity of each aspect mentioned in the text based on multimodal content. Various approaches have been proposed to model multimodal sentiment features for each aspect via modal interactions. However, most existing approaches have two shortcomings: (1) The representation gap between textual and visual modalities may increase the risk of misalignment in modal interactions; (2) In some examples where the image is not related to the text, the visual information may not enrich the textual modality when learning aspect-based sentiment features. In such cases, blindly leveraging information from visual modal may introduce noises in reasoning the aspect-based sentiment expressions. To tackle the shortcomings mentioned above, we propose an end-to-end MABSA framework with image conversion and noise filtration. Specifically, to bridge the representation gap in different modalities, we attempt to translate images into the input space of a pre-trained language model (PLM). To this end, we develop an image-to-text conversion module that can convert an image to an implicit sequence of token embedding. Moreover, an aspect-oriented filtration module is devised to alleviate the noise in the implicit token embeddings, which consists of two attention operations. The former aims to create an enhanced aspect embedding as a query, and the latter seeks to use this query to retrieve relevant auxiliary information from the implicit token embeddings to supplement the textual content. After filtering the noise, we leverage a PLM to encode the text, aspect, and image prompt derived from filtered implicit token embeddings as sentiment features to perform aspect-based sentiment prediction. Experimental results on two MABSA datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the proposed framework has superior robustness and efficiency. IEEE"
"Objectives: In the context of validating a measure of patient report specific to diagnostic accuracy in emergency department or urgent care, this study investigates patients’ and care partners’ perceptions of diagnoses as accurate and explores variations in how they reason while they assess accuracy. Methods: In February 2022, we surveyed a national panel of adults who had an emergency department or urgent care visit in the past month to test a patient-reported measure. As part of the survey validation, we asked for free-text responses about why the respondents indicated their (dis)agreement with 2 statements comprising patient-reported diagnostic accuracy: 1) the explanation they received of the health problem was true and 2) the explanation described what to expect of the health problem. Those paired free-text responses were qualitatively analyzed according to themes created inductively. Results: A total of 1,116 patients and care partners provided 982 responses coded into 10 themes, which were further grouped into 3 reasoning types. Almost one-third (32%) of respondents used only corroborative reasoning in assessing the accuracy of the health problem explanation (alignment of the explanation with either test results, patients’ subsequent health trajectory, their medical knowledge, symptoms, or another doctor’s opinion), 26% used only perception-based reasoning (perceptions of diagnostic process, uncertainty around the explanation received, or clinical team’s attitudes), and 27% used both types of reasoning. The remaining 15% used general beliefs or nonexplicated logic (used only about accurate diagnoses) and combinations of general reasoning with perception-based and corroborative. Conclusions: Patients and care partners used multifaceted reasoning in their assessment of diagnostic accuracy. Implications: As health care shifts toward meaningful diagnostic co-production and shared decision making, in-depth understanding of variations in patient reasoning and mental models informs use in clinical practice. An analysis of 982 responses examined how patients and care partners reason about the accuracy of diagnoses they received in emergency or urgent care. In reasoning, people used their perception of the process and whether the diagnosis matched other factual information they have. We introduce “patient reasoning” in the diagnostic measurement context as an area of further research to inform diagnostic shared decision making and co-production of health. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Music plays an important role in our daily life. It can have a powerful effect on our emotions, mental health, and even the community we live in. Although numerous studies have been conducted to prove the great impact music has on humans, few investigations place an emphasis on the exploration of the relationship between music and listener’s sentiment. To this end, we first examined three song demographics: Beats Per Minute, Key, and Length, and six song metrics: Danceability, Energy, Speechiness, Acousticness, Liveness, and Valence of popular songs, and then conducted an empirical study to examine the potential correlation between song demographics/metrics and the sentiment expressed as in written text (such as social media). To accomplish this, we scraped around 20 million tweets referencing the most popular songs from 2018 to 2022 as shown on Spotify’s Top Global chart, as well as the immediate surrounding tweets, and performed a double sentiment analysis on the data. Our study concludes that there exists a significant correlation between all the pairs of song metrics. From the sentiment analysis of tweets, our results indicate that there may not be a significant correlation between the sentiment expressed in tweets of a song’s listeners and the song itself. Our study provides empirical evidence for a deeper understanding of popular songs using data mining techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Text-based person re-identification (ReID) has enabled canonical applications in searching for and tracking targets from large-scale surveillance images with textual descriptions. Yet, existing text-based person ReID systems employ centralized model training that gathers images captured by different institutes&#x0027; cameras into one place, which poses severe privacy threats to sensitive institutional information. This work is then devoted to exploring privacy-preserving text-based person ReID and proposes the framework of FedSH by tailoring the federated learning paradigm for distributed searching knowledge extraction. Specifically, FedSH resolves the local model generalization and entity boundary obscuring limitations, caused by inner-institute data homogeneity and inter-institute data heterogeneity, via building multi-granularity feature representation and a semantically self-aligned network. Meanwhile, it reduces the communication burden introduced by the embedding for multiple modals by updating common representation subspaces during federated learning. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve at most 16.47&#x0025; and 16.02&#x0025; person ReID performance improvement by the Rank-1 metric, compared with 6 State-of-The-Art (SoTA) baselines and 6 ablation studies. We believe that our work will inspire the community to investigate the potential of implementing Federated Learning in real-world image retrieval and ReID scenarios. IEEE"
"The study aims to explore the portrayal of gender and the representation of gender roles in picturebooks written for children aged 3–6 in Turkey, with a view to assessing whether these gender portrayals include gender stereotypes that may affect children from early ages and onwards. It examines 45 children’s picturebooks published in the last 10 years in Turkey and written for children aged 3–6. The texts and illustrations of the selected books are examined thematically in terms of parental activities, other activities of adults, activities of children, and play types and toys using content analysis. The findings demonstrate that, despite significant international trends to tackle gender stereotypes and encourage a gender-neutral representation in children’s picturebooks to enhance gender-conscious child development, the male and female characters in the books are still stereotypically represented in Turkey, parallel to the larger approach to gender equality, perpetuating the traditional understanding of gender roles. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging, transforming and revolutionary technology that has captured attention worldwide. It is translating research into precision oncology treatments. AI can analyse large or big data sets requiring high-speed specialized computing solutions. The data are big in terms of volume and multimodal with the amalgamation of images, text and structure. Machine learning has identified antifungal drug targets, and taxonomic and phylogenetic classification of fungi based on sequence analysis is now available. Real-time identification tools and user-friendly mobile applications for identifying fungi have been discovered. Akin to histopathology, AI can be applied to fungal cytology. AI has been fruitful in cytopathology of the thyroid gland, breast, urine and uterine cervical lesions. AI has a huge scope in fungal cytology and would certainly bear fruit with its accuracy, reproducibility and capacity for handling big data.

"The proliferation of information and communication technologies has augmented and diversified information sources. However, an increase in the volume and selection of information does not necessarily promote understanding [1]. In addition, conventional evaluations of information transfer have focused only on the arrival of information at receivers. They should adequately contemplate the recipients' comprehension of the data post-acquisition [2]. In this study, we propose the concept of ""information digestion"", which refers to receivers' adequate understanding of the acquired information.

One of its remarkable features is its selectivity, allowing precise dopamine detection even in the presence of common interfering substances found in urine samples. The practical utility of this biosensor is demonstrated through satisfactory dopamine recovery rates in artificial urine samples, ranging from 92.6% to 94.6%. Overall, our proposed RuO<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> biosensor on FPCB offers a promising solution for accurate and selective dopamine detection, with potential applications in wearable devices and flexible electronics.

"This essay analyses the discursive presence of Virginia Woolf in French literary journals of the 1920s and 1930s, in terms of both critical discourse (articles and reviews devoted to the writer and her work) and translated discourse (occasional translation of short excerpts inserted within critical commentary or longer instalments from her novels and short fiction). It mainly deals with issues at the crossroads of periodical, reception and translation studies - chiefly translational stylistics - to investigate whether the translation choices and strategies, particularly the deviations from the original, which were adopted by French intellectuals writing on Woolf in literary periodicals, might be said to be in line with the appraisal strategies they enacted, and the role these played in the creation and dissemination of Woolf 's authorial profile in interwar France. The analysis will demonstrate that changes mainly concern stylistic issues such as speech and thought presentation, transitivity and/or modality patterns, rhythmic and musical effects, and make the target text more lexically varied in compliance with the stylistic conventions of the target language. © 2023 EDUCatt.

"Accents, as variations from standard pronunciation, pose significant challenges for speech recognition systems. Although joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and accent recognition (AR) training has been proven effective in handling multi-accent scenarios, current multi-task ASR-AR approaches overlook the granularity differences between tasks. Fine-grained units capture pronunciation-related accent characteristics, while coarse-grained units are better for learning linguistic information. Moreover, an explicit interaction of two tasks can also provide complementary information and improve the performance of each other, but it is rarely used by existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupling and Interacting Multi-task Network (DIMNet) for joint speech and accent recognition, which is comprised of a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) branch, an AR branch, an ASR branch, and a bottom feature encoder. Specifically, AR and ASR are first decoupled by separated branches and two-granular modeling units to learn task-specific representations. The AR branch is from our previously proposed linguistic-acoustic bimodal AR model and the ASR branch is an encoder-decoder based Conformer model. Then, for the task interaction, the CTC branch provides aligned text for the AR task, while accent embeddings extracted from our AR model are incorporated into the ASR branch&#x0027;s encoder and decoder. Finally, during ASR inference, a cross-granular rescoring method is introduced to fuse the complementary information from the CTC and attention decoder after the decoupling. Our experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which achieves 21.45&#x0025; 28.53&#x0025; AR accuracy relative improvement and 32.33&#x0025; 14.55&#x0025; ASR error rate relative reduction over a published standard baseline, respectively.

"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to have life-limiting health consequences for many individuals and remains a significant threat to global public health. This qualitative study explores the experiences of people living with HIV in Sidama, Ethiopia. Interviews with 19 adults recruited from an HIV outpatient clinic were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The analysis method used was systematic text condensation. The results reveal that an HIV diagnosis triggered strong emotions. Economic concerns, stigma, and discrimination also increased the burden of a diagnosis, which could lead to a loss of income or housing. Consequently, informants’ ability to maintain a regular life and receive social and psychological support was reduced. Religious faith provided strength to informants, though they stated that some religious leaders do not support antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the everyday challenges of people living with HIV is crucial for health professionals and health programme developers working to promote health and enable people to follow their recommended course of treatment. Person-centred care is recommended. In particular, the poorest should receive attention. It is also crucial to reduce stigma and discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV and to motivate faith leaders to prevent HIV stigma and support antiretroviral therapy. © 2023 The Author(s).

"This research aims to design a literary text feature classification and information extraction model based on the principle of temporal association and rough set theory. We put forward a new text classification method through the in-depth study of time series correlation principle algorithm and text classification technology based on rough set theory. First, we propose to use the lexical space feature vector as the input channel of the rough set model to extract literary sentence-level features according to the spatial relationship between words. Secondly, aiming at the problem of low efficiency of KNN text classification algorithm, we propose a KNN literature text classification algorithm based on rough set approximation set, which significantly improves classification efficiency while ensuring classification accuracy. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proved by experiments, and it promotes the progress of rough set theory in practical application research. In addition, we propose an improved attribute reduction algorithm in the process of literary text classification by combining feature selection, information extraction, and the correlation of feature items generated by text description and the evaluation criteria of rough set itself. This algorithm makes the reduced attribute set more important, and then improves the text recognition rate. Through comparative experiments, it is proved that our improved method increases the number of applicable texts by 12.86%, and the improvement effect is good. In summary, our model combines the temporal correlation principle with rough set theory, and provides a new method for feature classification and information extraction of literary texts. Our results demonstrate that the method is able to achieve better classification results when applied to collections of literary texts. Authors"
"Research on the early Sufis of Hamadān, Nahāwand, and Abhar holds immense significance in comprehending the development of Sufism in the Jibāl region. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the initial stages of Sufism’s formation, focusing on the analysis of significant early Sufi texts. Specifically, the study investigates the treatises Karāmāt Sheikh abī ʻalī al-Qūmsānī, Ādāb al-fuqarāʼ, and Rawḍat al-murīdīn, authored by Ibn Zīrak al-Nahāwandī (d. 471/1078), Bābā Jaʻfar al-Abharī (d. 428/1036), and Ibn Yazdānyār al-Hamadānī (d. 472/1079), respectively. Despite their profound significance, the role of these texts in shaping Sufism within the Islamic world has received limited attention in Sufi studies. Consequently, this study contributes valuable insights into the development of Iraqi-based Sufism in Hamadān and its neighboring centers, spanning from the third/ninth century to the fifth/eleventh century. Notably, some Sufis in this region were disciples of Abū ʻAlī al-Nahāwandī al-Qūmsānī (d. 387/997), playing a pivotal role in the institutionalization of Sufism through the establishment of khāneqāhs in the area. © 2023 International Institute of Islamic Thought."
"We present Global Causal Analysis (GCA) for text classification. GCA is a technique for global model-agnostic explainability drawing from well-established observational causal structure learning algorithms. GCA generates an explanatory graph from high-level human-interpretable features, revealing how these features affect each other and the black-box output. We show how these high-level features do not always have to be human-annotated, but can also be computationally inferred. Moreover, we discuss how the explanatory graph can be used for global model analysis in natural language processing (NLP): the graph shows the effect of different types of features on model behavior, whether these effects are causal effects or mere (spurious) correlations, and if and how different features interact. We then propose a three-step method for (semi-)automatically evaluating the quality, fidelity and stability of the GCA explanatory graph without requiring a ground truth. Finally, we provide a detailed GCA of a state-of-the-art NLP model, showing how setting a global one-versus-rest contrast can improve explanatory relevance, and demonstrating the utility of our three-step evaluation method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Aims and Objectives: To map out the primary research studies relating to how virtual reality (VR) has been used to distract children and young people with long-term conditions from pain or pruritus. Background: Pharmacologic treatment of chronic pain and pruritus may have side effects; hence, non-invasive non-pharmacological treatments are being sought. Design: The scoping review followed the methodology recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute, PAGER framework and PRISMA-ScR checklist. The protocol was registered with the Open Science Registration on 14 February 2022 https//doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/K2R93. Methods: Five databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched. Data were extracted from primary research studies published between 2000 and 2022 involving children and adolescent populations (<21 years) with a long-term condition that had an element of enduring pruritus and/or pain. Results: Of 464 abstracts screened, 35 full-text papers were assessed with 5 studies meeting the eligibility criteria. Three main themes emerged from the included studies: (1) Improvements in pain and daily functioning; (2) positive perceptions of VR and (3) accessibility and feasibility of VR. No papers were found on the effect of VR on alleviating pruritus. Conclusion: VR is feasible, acceptable, and safe for children and adolescents with chronic pain in a range of long-term conditions and offers promise as an adjunctive treatment for improving chronic pain and quality of life. No studies were identified that targeted pruritis or measured pruritis outcomes; thus, the effects of VR for pruritis are unknown. There is a need for rigorously designed, randomised controlled trials to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of VR interventions for chronic pain and pruritis in children and adolescents. The use of the PAGER (Patterns, Advances, Gaps, Evidence for Practice and Research Recommendations) framework for scoping reviews helped to structure analysis and findings and identify research gaps. Relevance to Clinical Practice: VR interventions offer promise in improving chronic pain related to long-term conditions. © 2023 The Authors.

"Background: Othello syndrome (OS) is a condition characterized by a delusion of jealousy that one's spouse is having extramarital affairs. As in the eponymous Shakespearean tragedy, there is an unfortunate risk of violence. For patients with these symptoms, consultation-liaison psychiatrists may be asked to assist with evaluating the differential diagnosis, assessing safety, and developing treatment options. Objective: This study's objective was to solidify current knowledge of the clinical presentations and management of OS through a systematic review of the literature and description of 2 new cases. Methods: We conducted a literature search from the start of relevant databases through August 2023 to identify English language case reports of adults (≥18 years) with OS that described clinical evaluations, biological treatments, and outcomes. We extracted demographics, proposed etiologies, treatment choices and responses, duration of delusions, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, neuro-radiographic findings, and presence of physical violence. We reported clinical findings for 2 new cases. Results: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we screened 705 abstracts and conducted full-text reviews of 118 articles to identify 73 cases published from 1983 to 2023 meeting inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58.2 years with male predominance (M:F = 1.88). Etiologies included primary psychiatric disorders (16, 22%), other medical conditions (38, 52%), and medications or other substances (19, 26%). Delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, and dopaminergic agonists were the most common etiologies, respectively, in these groups. Antipsychotics were the most common treatment (57, 78%). Symptom remission was reported in 51 (70%) cases. The average duration of OS was 39.5 months. Of 32 cases reporting brain imaging insults, 12 of 20 (60%) showed right-sided lesions, and 8 of 20 (40%) showed left-sided lesions, with 9 of 32 (28%) located in the frontal lobes. The most commonly co-existing psychiatric symptom was depression (14, 19%). Violence was reported in 25 cases (34%). Our 2 new cases were consistent with these findings. Conclusions: OS may be a manifestation of several neuropsychiatric conditions, primarily delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's dementia, and the use of dopaminergic agonists. One-third of cases include violent behaviors. It appears to respond to antipsychotic medications, but treatment is delayed more than 3 years on average. Available data have not localized OS to a specific brain region. © 2023 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry"
"Streaming services have become a primary intermediary between international content producers and global audiences, and their palpable influence as gatekeepers, tastemakers, and disruptors of media industries abroad have significant ramifications for the way television is produced and distributed. Using the case study of how Netflix is influencing the Japanese anime industry, this research outlines the contradictory ways that the streaming service engages with international media and how local creators are grappling with the specter of globalism that Netflix represents in their own work. Utilizing textual analysis, discursive analysis, and interviews with industry insiders, this article identifies some of the shifts that are occurring in the anime industry due to the advent of Netflix on the level of production and text. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The article presents a comparative analysis of Andrey Platonov’s play “Noah’s Ark (Cain’s Spawn)” and Alan Moore’s graphic novel “Watchmen”. The focus is on the common features in the depiction of the causes and forms of the apocalypse, which is the event core of the plots of both works. The first stage of the research covers the mechanism of “alternative history”, which takes place both in “Watchmen” and in Platonov’s play. Introducing real historical figures and events into the plot, the writers declare the situation of the approaching end of the world caused by the Cold War. The second stage is devoted to the conceptual triad “personal individualism – national exclusivity – conviction in God’s election”. The characters of the play and the graphic novel are endowed with saliently individualistic personal traits. At the same time, the characters are related to specific states (or nations). The egoism of each character conveys the conviction of a particular country in its own exclusivity and God-chosen nature. Platonov and Moore see the impossibility of humanity, represented by “exceptional” people, to conduct a constructive dialogue. As a result, the world is portrayed by the authors as noisy and chaotic. The significance of global cacophony in the context of the apocalyptic writers is also considered by the author at one of the stages of the work. The intertext analysis makes it possible to highlight not only the historical foundations for the similarity of the description of the apocalypse in the play and the graphic novel, but also the fundamental difference in its understanding by the Soviet writer and the British author. The years separating Platonov and Moore, life circumstances, as well as their belonging to different cultures (Soviet and British) set the grounds for a deepest divergence in the interpretation of the image of the human future, which is obviously embedded in the ideological layers of both texts. This point is considered by the author at the final stage of the study. The research is based on the achievements of the Platonov studies specialists who previously devoted their works to the author’s last play (N. M. Malygina, N. V. Kornienko, I. V. Kukulin, etc.), as well as on materials that offer an explanation of the social basis of mass science fiction literature of the 20th century (works by U. Eco, M. Dipaolo, etc.). © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Digital image collections are becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use. Still, the need for adequate indexing information makes it difficult for users to find the specific images they need. With the vast number of digital images generated daily, these databases have become enormous, making accurate image retrieval challenging. One of the most challenging tasks in computer vision and multimedia research is image annotation, where keywords are assigned to an image. Unlike humans, computers can measure colors, textures, and shapes of images but fail to interpret them semantically, known as the semantic gap. This makes image annotation complex. For semantic-level concepts generation the raw image pixels provide not enough Unmistakable information. Which mean for of ""words"" or ""sentences"" there is no clear definition with the semantics of an image unlike text annotation. Therefore, this study aims to bridge the semantic gap between low-level computer features and human interpretation of images. The proposed enhanced automatic image annotation system maps multiple labels or into single image, providing an in-depth understanding of the visual content&#x2019;s meaning. This is achieved by combining CNN-based multiple features (Y is the luma component of the color, Cb and Cr is the blue component and red component called YCbCr color space and Gaussian&#x2013;Laplacian Pyramid) and neighbors to recall and balance precision. The image annotation (IA) scheme uses a Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) model with CNN- Gaussian&#x2013;Laplacian Pyramid and learning representation to predict image annotation (IA) accurately. The proposed image annotation (IA) system was execution on three public datasets and showed excellent flexibility of annotation, improved accuracy, and reduced computational costs compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The image annotation (IA) framework can provide immense benefits in accurately selecting and extracting image features, minimizing computational complexity and facilitating annotation. Authors"
"Creativity in pivot AVT is a burning issue, since the pivot text can be seen as imposing pre-existing patterns, which may limit the translator’s decision-making process and influence their creative output. To verify this, we examined the Italian subtitled and dubbed versions of the film Parasite (Bong Joon-ho, 2019), a well-known example of Korean audiovisual content transferred interlinguistically using English as a pivot language. The preliminary textual analysis of the data showed that both the Italian versions were also created using the pivot translation by Darcy Paquet. Being unable to retrieve the name of the Italian subtitler, we examined the Italian subtitles and found they are very close to the English pivot, often replicating some creative and controversial choices. For the Italian dubbing, we managed to interview the Italian dialogue writer (and dubbing director) and the translator. Their feedback on the translation process and the comparative analysis of the Korean source text, English subtitles and Italian dubbing demonstrated that the Italian dubbing team relied not only on the English subtitles but also on subtitles in other languages and the Korean script to create a text that often departs from the English pivot, and it is closer to the original. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The Failure Mode Effect Analysis process (FMEA) is widely used in industry for risk assessment, as it effectively captures and documents domain-specific knowledge. This process is mainly concerned with causal domain knowledge. In practical applications, FMEAs encounter challenges in terms of comprehensibility, particularly related to inadequate coverage of listed failure modes and their corresponding effects and causes. This can be attributed to the limitations of traditional brainstorming approaches typically employed in the FMEA process. Depending on the size and diversity in terms of disciplines of the team conducting the analysis, these approaches may not adequately capture a comprehensive range of failure modes, leading to gaps in coverage. To this end, methods for improving FMEA knowledge comprehensibility are highly needed. A potential approach to address this gap is rooted in recent advances in common-sense knowledge graph completion, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of text-aware graph embedding techniques. However, the applicability of such methods in an industrial setting is limited. This paper addresses this issue on FMEA documents in an industrial environment. Here, the application of common-sense knowledge graph completion methods on FMEA documents from semiconductor manufacturing is studied. These methods achieve over 20% MRR on the test set and 70% of the top 10 predictions were manually assessed to be plausible by domain experts. Based on the evaluation, this paper confirms that text-aware knowledge graph embedding for common-sense knowledge graph completion are more effective than structure-only knowledge graph embedding for improving FMEA knowledge comprehensibility. Additionally we found that language model in domain fine-tuning is beneficial for extracting more meaningful embedding, thus improving the overall model performance.  © ; 2023 The Authors."
"This article combines two neglected elements within the history of online news: public service news sites and weather reporting, and it does so by utilising web archives, which – surprisingly – do not figure very prominently in journalism history. The two elements have – in isolation and in combination – at least in Denmark, become increasingly important as the online news sections of the two public service institutions Denmark’s Radio (DR) and TV2 consistently are among the most visited news sites and since reporting on the weather has gained in prominence and more recently, at least on DR TV, has become increasingly educational in its linking to issues of climate change. This article focusses on online news and conducts a historical analysis of the weather reporting on DR.dk from 2005 to 2022. The analysis seeks to balance the coding of journalistic texts with considerations of the online form of journalism, which here broadly means reading the webpage as a text. A key focus in the analysis is how meteorological data have been woven into cultural and social narratives, some of which are linked to climate change. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The rise of online meetings has led to an increase in the amount of audio and visual data that needs to be processed in order to extract relevant information. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a novel approach to online meeting summarization based on text and image processing. This approach involves using natural language processing techniques to extract important information from the audio transcript of the meeting and image processing techniques to extract key visual information from the video stream. The proposed system takes into account various factors, such as speaker turns, sentiment analysis, and key visual elements, and uses these factors to generate a comprehensive summary of the meeting. The system has been evaluated on a dataset of online meetings, and the results show that it is able to generate accurate and concise summaries. This approach has significant potential for improving the efficiency of online meetings by enabling participants to quickly review the most important points discussed during the meeting. Furthermore, it could also be used for automated transcription and captioning, which could help make online meetings more accessible to individuals with hearing impairments. Overall, online meeting summarization based on text and image processing has the potential to greatly enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of online communication. A method to extract keywords from educational video transcripts from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) is discussed. The approach is primarily based totally on Regular Expression Grammar Rule technique to identify the Noun Chunks in the textual content of the transcript. Extracting keywords helps in finding out the specifically important part of the educational material. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"In recent times, there has been a notable increase in efforts to simultaneously comprehend vision and language, driven by the availability of video-related datasets and advancements in language models within the domain of natural language processing. Dense video captioning poses a significant challenge in understanding untrimmed video and generating several event-based sentences to describe the video. Numerous endeavors have been undertaken to enhance the efficacy of the dense video captioning task by the utilization of various approaches, such as bottom-up, top-down, parallel pipeline, pretraining, etc. In contrast, the weakly supervised dense video captioning method presents a highly promising strategy for generating dense video captions solely based on captions, without relying on any knowledge of ground-truth events, which distinguishes it from widely employed approaches. Nevertheless, this approach has a drawback that inadequate captions might hurt both event localization and captioning. This paper introduces PWS-DVC, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the performance of weakly supervised dense video captioning. PWS-DVC's event captioning module is initially trained on video-clip datasets, which are extensively accessible video datasets by leveraging the absence of ground-truth data during training. Subsequently, it undergoes fine-tuning specifically for dense video captioning. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of PWS-DVC, we conduct comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods using the ActivityNet Captions dataset. The findings indicate that PWS-DVC exhibits improved performance in comparison to current approaches in weakly supervised dense video captioning.  © ; 2023 The Authors."
"This study examines the securitisation of terrorism in Ethiopia with the objective of demystifying the way anti-terrorist legislation and counterterrorism discourse have been used to legitimise state terror in the country. To achieve this, the study adopts Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a method to analyse the data obtained from written and spoken texts. The analysis reveals that terrorism, defined as the threat or use of violence against non-combatants for political ends, has been endemic in Ethiopia. However, the narrative of terrorism as an existential threat to Ethiopia emerged immediately after the contested election of 2005. The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)-led government imported the Western counterterrorism discourse and officially adopted anti-terrorist legislation with the intention of disciplining the heightened political opposition and stifling critical voices that questioned its legitimacy in the aftermath of the election. Finally, it argues that the rebranding of terrorism as an existential threat to Ethiopia and the consequent adoption of anti-terrorist legislation are political strategies aimed at maintaining the ruling minority’s grip on political power by legitimising state terrorism in the country. © 2023 The Author(s).

"In this paper, I focus on Edmund Husserl’s analyses of the act of approval and the role he attributes to it in his ethics. I show that we can deepen our understanding of both if we rely on his critical reflections on Shaftesbury’s theory of affections in his lecture course Einleitung in die Ethik. The sections of this course devoted to Shaftesbury are the only place in Husserl’s later philosophical production where he addresses the need to clarify the nature of approval from a phenomenological point of view and provides precise indications about the role that such emotions play in our life. I thereby examine Husserl’s criticisms of Shaftesbury’s account of reflective emotions, and I compare these criticisms with Husserl’s account of approval in the texts from the Konvolut über Billigung collected in the Studien zur Struktur des Bewusstseins. I argue that, according to Husserl, approval is an essential but not sufficient component in the pursuit of virtue. The upshot is that crucial parts of Husserl’s ethics come from a radical and original reworking of central notions of the early modern sentimentalist tradition. © 2023 BSHP."
"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the most vital technology in currently utilized, specifically caused by the huge and growing count of online texts that requires that understood for its massive value that completely asserted. NLP is create a sense of unstructured data, which are created by social networks and other social data sources, and is supported to organize them into an additional structured model that assists several kinds of tasks and applications. Sentiment analysis (SA), a subfield of NLP contains determining the sentiment expressed or emotional tone from a piece of text. Deep learning (DL) approaches are significantly advanced the field of SA, permitting for more accurate and nuanced classification of sentiments from the text data. In this article, we present an Advanced Sentiment Analysis using a Red-Tailed Hawk Optimizer with Ensemble Learning (ASA-RTHEL) Strategy in NLP. The aim of ASA-RTHEL technique is to exploit the strategies of ensemble learning with a hyperparameter tuning process for SA. The ASA-RTHEL technique mainly follows an ensemble learning-based classification process, which combines prediction from three DL approaches convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The ensemble process results in enhanced SA performance and decreases the risk of depending only on a single model bias or error. To boost the SA performance, the hyperparameter tuning strategy is performed by the use of the RTH algorithm. An extensive set of experiments were carried out for ensuring the superior SA results of ASA-RTHEL technique. The comprehensive comparison study highlighted the enhanced results of the MPONLP-TSA method on the recognition of various kinds of sentiments.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Course developers, providers and instructors gather feedback from students to gain insights into student satisfaction, success and difficulties in the learning process. The traditional manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive, resulting in decreased insights and pedagogical impact. To address the problems, researchers use natural language processing techniques that apply the fields of machine learning, statistics and artificial intelligence to the feedback datasets for various purposes. These purposes include predicting sentiment, opinion research, insights into students&#x0027; views of the course, and so on. The aim of this study is to identify themes and categories in academic research reports that use natural language processing for student feedback. Previous review studies have focused exclusively on sentiment analysis and specific techniques such as machine learning and deep learning. Our study put forward a comprehensive synthesis of various aspects, from the data to the methods used, to the data translation and labelling efforts, and to the categorisation of prediction&#x002F;analysis targets in the literature. The synthesis includes two tables that allow the reader to compare the studies themselves and present the identified themes and categorisations in one figure and text. The methods, tools and data of 28 peer-reviewed papers are synthesised in 20 categories under six themes: aim and categorisation, methods and models, and tools and data (Size and Context, Language, and Labelling). Our research findings presented in this paper can inform researchers in the field in structuring their research ideas and methods, and in identifying gaps and needs in the literature for further development.

"Background: Social media platforms have emerged as a useful channel for health promotion communication, offering different channels to reach targeted populations. For example, social media has recently been used to disseminate information about COVID-19 vaccination across various demographics. Traditional modes of health communication such as television, health events, and newsletters may not reach all groups within a community. Health communications for younger generations are increasingly disseminated through social media to reflect key information sources. This paper explores a social media gaming platform as an alternative way to reach young people in health promotion research. Objective: This protocol study aimed to pilot-test the potential of Twitch, a live streaming platform initially designed for video gaming, to conduct health promotion research with young people. We used COVID-19 vaccination as a topical case study that was recommended by Australian health authorities at the time of the research. Methods: The research team worked with a Twitch Account Manager to design and test a case study within the guidelines and ethics protocols required by Twitch, identify suitable streamers to approach and establish a protocol for conducting research on the platform. This involved conducting a poll to initiate discussion about COVID-19 vaccination, monitoring the chat in 3 live Twitch sessions with 2 streamers to pilot the protocol, and briefly analyze Twitch chat logs to observe the range of response types that may be acquired from this methodology. Results: The Twitch streams provided logs and videos on demand that were derived from the live session. These included demographics of viewers, chat logs, and polling results. The results of the poll showed a range of engagement in health promotion for the case study topic: the majority of participants had received their vaccination by the time of the poll; however, there was still a proportion that had not received their vaccination yet or had decided to not be vaccinated. Analysis of the Twitch chat logs demonstrated a range of both positive and negative themes regarding health promotion for the case study topic. This included irrelevant comments, misinformation (compared to health authority information at the time of this study), comedic and conspiracy responses, as well as vaccine status, provaccine comments, and vaccine-hesitant comments. Conclusions: This study developed and tested a protocol for using Twitch data for health promotion research with young people. With live polling, open text discussion between participants and immediate responses to questions, Twitch can be used to collect both quantitative and qualitative research data from demographics that use social media. The platform also presents some challenges when engaging with independent streamers and sensitive health topics. This study provides an initial protocol for future researchers to use and build on. ©Brian Chau, Melody Taba, Rachael Dodd, Kirsten McCaffery, Carissa Bonner."
"Existing software tools for specifying and executing multidrone missions are limited to route planning or tightly coupled to specific drone hardware. We introduce EAMOS (Execution of Aerial Multidrone Missions and Operations Specification Framework), which allows us to specify missions intuitively, text-based, and provides a mission compiler, a mission middle layer, and a distributed drone execution environment. The middle layer wraps the control of individual drone-specific capabilities, such as launch, fly to position, or perform a maneuver, into a public API that transparently utilizes the capabilities of numerous drone platforms. We exploit the Go programming language to implement critical components of the framework and provide an interface for ROS-based drone platforms. EAMOS automates the mission execution on real, virtual, and even hybrid robotic setups involving real and virtual drones. We demonstrate the successful deployment of EAMOS with four missions executed on Pixhawk/PX4-equipped quadcopters and virtual drones simulated with Airsim. We assess the performance of our proposed approach by analyzing the number of nodes and arcs of the mission graphs, which are an essential artifact of our mission compilation, the utilization of ROS service calls during mission execution, and the duration of compilation, deployment, and mission execution. Overall, our experiments showed that our drones correctly behaved during mission execution as expected and specified by their mission, the generated mission artifacts were efficiently manageable, and processing times allowed for a fluent workflow.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Counterpublic research highlights the significance of counter-discourse in challenging dominant public spheres. Yet, less focus has been given to how counterpublic actors could destabilize the relationships within a dominant public to foster counter-discourse. I examine the creation of a feminist counterpublic within Twitter K-pop fandom to understand how oppositional actors can transform the toxic technocultures of the dominant public to create a counterpublic. Formed by feminist K-pop fans, this counterpublic defied toxic relational norms of the mainstream K-pop fandom, cultivating a culture where fans could critique problematic K-pop star text without renouncing their fan identity. I bring the concepts of relational schemas and scripts to the study of counterpublics to demonstrate how creating an alternative schema can be a tool of resistance. To do so, I highlight how feminist fans reappropriated existing relationship scripts and formulated new ones to modify the relational schema of the mainstream K-pop fandom. I argue that these relational strategies helped feminist fans regroup by creating opportunities for productive coexistence, facilitating an alternative relational schema around a critical fan identity. © 2023 (Yena Lee).

"Sentiment analysis is a highly valuable tool, particularly in the realm of social media, as it enables us to understand the public’s opinions regarding specific products or topics. However, analyzing short and unstructured texts like tweets can present significant challenges. This paper explores conventional Machine Learning (ML) approaches like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine to analyze sentiment and compares them against Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT). Moreover, we suggest a new preprocessing technique for sentiment analysis to enhance the effectiveness of these methods. Our findings demonstrate noteworthy enhancements in the performance of conventional ML models. Interestingly, our study reveals that BERT outperforms all aforementioned models, yielding an accuracy of about 94%, though incurring a high computational cost. Additionally, Logistic Regression performs well with a 90.35% accuracy rate. With respect to feature extraction, we showcase that combining unigram and bigram words provides a more thorough comprehension of negation, as opposed to solely relying on unigrams. Finally, we propose an approach for managing emoticons and emojis that has proven to be useful in the fields of sentiment analysis and sarcasm interpretation. © 2023 by the authors."
"For qualitative data analysis (QDA), researchers assign codes to text segments to arrange the information into topics or concepts. These annotations facilitate information retrieval and the identification of emerging patterns in unstructured data. However, this metadata is typically not published or reused after the research. Subsequent studies with similar research questions require a new definition of codes and do not benefit from other analysts’ experience. Machine learning (ML) based classification seeded with such data remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of code definitions and the inherent subjectivity of the exercise. Previous attempts to support QDA using ML rely on linear models and only examined individual datasets that were either smaller or coded specifically for this purpose. However, we show that modern approaches effectively capture at least part of the codes’ semantics and may generalize to multiple studies. We analyze the performance of multiple classifiers across three large real-world datasets. Furthermore, we propose an ML-based approach to identify semantic relations of codes in different studies to show thematic faceting, enhance retrieval of related content, or bootstrap the coding process. These are encouraging results that suggest how analysts might benefit from prior interpretation efforts, potentially yielding new insights into qualitative data. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The paper is developing a new statistical approach to automatic partitioning of texts into parts belonging to different authors. It is based on the analysis of processes that counts the number of different words forward and backward. The theoretical study of the processes is based on the assumptions of an elementary probability model with a change point. We prove consistence of our statistical estimate of the point of concatenation in the case when the concatenated texts have different Zipf exponents. This method is being tested on the Brown corpus and also on newspaper texts in different languages. Testing shows a good estimate of the concatenation point. This method can be used in parallel with other text segmentation methods. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Background: With the introduction of nanotechnology in dentistry, the use of nanoparticles to strengthen acrylic resins has received much attention. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different percentages (1%, 2%, 3% & 5%) of Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 nanoparticles in acrylic resin on the bending strength. Materials & Methods: The PRISMA 2020 Checklist was used to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis as the basis for the current investigation. Up until 23 October 2022, systematic literature searches were conducted on Scopus, PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase. Then, a fixed-effect model and the inverse-variance method were been utilized to generate the 95% confidence interval for mean differences. Data from the meta-analysis has been analyzed utilizing Stata/MP v.17 software. Results: A review of abstracts from 800 studies was conducted in the initial review of the study to eliminate duplicates; full texts of 391 studies were reviewed by two authors, and 14 studies were ultimately chosen. The mean flexural strength difference between the control group and the 1% Al2O3 reinforcement was-6.19 (MD,-6.19 95% CI-8.26,-4.11; p=0.00). The mean flexural strength difference between the control group and the 3% SiO2 reinforcement was 4.58 (MD, 4.58 95% CI 3.61, 5.56; p=0.00). The mean flexural strength difference between the control group and the 1% TiO2 reinforcement was-4.08 (MD,-4.08 95% CI-35.03, 26.87; p=0.80). Conclusions: It can be concluded from the present meta-analysis that the properties of polymers reinforced with nanoparticles depend on their type and concentration. © 2023. Kavan Yaghmoori, et al."
"With this paper, we aim to look into the issue of identities among the immigrant population living in the West using an integrative multimodal approach. Although this topic has been in fashion for quite some time, most studies analyze either the political or mass-media discourse related to immigrants or reflect on how immigrants see themselves, on the basis of textual analysis of immigrants’ narratives and interviews. Our study takes a different approach and analyzes a video recorded and published on YouTube, focusing not only on the text but also on by analyzing non-verbal manifestations of changing positions on the part of the narrator. In particular, we examine identities/positions that the main protagonist, a Moroccan immigrant named Omar, assumes in the course of the story. We show how one particular gesture (pointing), coupled with other verbal and non-verbal markers, can signal a change of identity/position. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"As machine learning models become increasingly complex, the ability to provide explanations for their predictions becomes more important. In this work, we propose the Xi method, a novel technique for providing pre hoc and post hoc explanations of black box regression models. The Xi method is based on distances between probability distributions, which can be interpreted as variable importance measures. Notably, the explanations provided by this method are backed by theoretical guarantees, as they are obtained through statistical estimators that are proven to be asymptotically consistent. Additionally, the Xi method is model and data agnostic, meaning that it can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models and data types. To demonstrate the potential of the Xi method, we provide applications that encompass three different data types: tabular, image, and text. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Every elementary teacher deals with students who struggle as readers on a daily basis. Each struggling child is complex and each has a unique history as a learner. In One Child at a Time, experienced literacy specialist and consultant Pat Johnson provides a framework she has used in numerous K-6 classrooms to help teachers understand and assist individual children. The four-step process outlined in the book enables teachers to focus carefully on specific strategies and behaviors; analyze them with theoretical and practical lenses; design targeted instruction in keeping with current research on reading process; and then assess and refine the teaching in conferences with the child. The framework is by no means an easy answer to a difficult problem, but through its use teachers learn how the reading process works for proficient readers and how to support struggling readers as they construct their own reading process. The text is packed with examples of actual conferences with students, detailing how and when Pat and her colleagues intervene to instruct and assess. The examples of follow-up assessment and analysis of struggling readers over days and weeks provide an indispensable model for teachers. Pat shows how to use this framework successfully with a range of learners, including young children, English language learners, and students in the upper elementary grades who are stalled in their literacy progress. She builds upon her decades of work as a classroom teacher, literacy specialist, and consultant in schools with high poverty and diversity, to demonstrate how this framework can be useful in any setting. © 2006 by Patricia Johnson.

"In 1951, the Chuvash composer and folklorist S. M. Maksimov made recordings of folk songs from the Chuvash settlers in the Prokopyevsk district of the Kemerovo region. In 2022, the authors of this paper conducted fieldwork to collect samples of Chuvash folklore in the same places. The folklore recordings were also found that were made in different areas of the Vol-ga-Ural region, the territories of the ""exit"" of the Chuvash-Siberian settlers. All the above re-cordings made up the material of the present study. The comparative analysis of the texts of autochthonous and migration traditions has shown their variability to be manifested at differ-ent levels, including common stable word combinations carrying a specific symbolic load, song themes, and structure-level matches. The stable images include high mountains, swal-lows, a dove, a running red fox, a river, a black and a ladle, all of them loading the song texts with a symbolic, in some cases sacred, meaning. The song themes are quite diverse, with those of separation, good relationships with relatives, the hero s inner state, and reflections on the transience of life prevailing. In terms of structure, the texts compared can be related dif-ferently: from a single-line match to the similarity in the content of two or three song stanzas. The analysis has revealed a stable continuity between the Siberian and the Volga region s lo-cal traditions. Moreover, many Siberian samples involve rethinking the genre of songs, from ritual and ceremonial to lyrical. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"An efficient, impartial, and independent judiciary is a major demand for Moroccan citizens. In online advocacy, citizens denounce the flawed judiciary, sometimes virally circulating content on its corruption and susceptibility to interference. On tv, non-fiction programs respond to frequent requests for legal advice from audiences. Meanwhile, dramas employ frames that reflect codes on how society should perceive the judiciary and the rule of law. This article assesses the dominant frames of the judiciary on tv dramas. Two programs, Moudāwala and Al-MadCombining dot belowī La Yamūt, are selected based on their relevance and popularity. The qualitative analysis of these programs incorporates character and narrative portrayals into thematic and frame analyses. As the two programs illustrate judicial struggles from within and without, they exemplify portrayals of the legal system that uncover discrepancies between normative practices and ruthless realities. The judiciary's dominant frames focus on individual solutions and blame citizens for ignoring judicial texts or institutions. Frames reflect how media avoid watchdogging the judiciary and extend, directly or otherwise, hegemony over both the judiciary and the media.  © 2023 Brill Academic Publishers. All rights reserved."
"The effect of emotion on associative memory is still an open question. Our aim was to test whether discrepant findings are due to differential impact of emotion on different types of associative memory or to differences in the way participants encoded stimuli across studies. We examined the effect of negative content on multiple forms of associative memory, using the same encoding task. Two registered experiments were conducted in parallel with random allocation of participants to experiments. Each experiment included 4 encoding blocks, in which participants read a neutral text comprised of 6 paragraphs, which were interleaved with neutral or negative images. Images were controlled for visual properties and semantic similarity. Memory tests included recognition memory, Remember/Know, order memory, temporal source memory and contextual memory. Analyses showed that emotion decreased contextual memory but not order memory or temporal source memory. We also found that temporal source memory and contextual memory were correlated. Recognition accuracy and subjective recollection were not impacted by emotion. In agreement with previous work, participants self-reported a reduced ability to integrate blocks containing negative images with paragraphs. In contrast to our hypothesis, results suggest that emotion does not impact all types of associative memory when stimuli are controlled. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a wide range of public health, economic, social, and political shocks, setting in motion life events that reverberated to affect individuals' mental health. Moving beyond a checklist approach, this study drew on individuals' own words to identify both conventional and novel sources of stress during COVID-19 and examine the role of stressful life events in producing gender disparities in depressive symptoms. Drawing on a 2021 U.S. nationally representative survey, we coded text responses to an open-ended question on stressful life events and conducted descriptive and regression analyses (n = 1733). The analyses revealed three key findings. First, men were more likely to report having experienced no stressful life events or else mention politics as a source of stress. Women, by comparison, were more likely to report the following as stressful—inability to socialize, paid work, care work, health, or the death of loved ones. Second, for both women and men, respondents reporting no stressful life events had the lowest, and those reporting finances as the most stressful life event had the highest, depressive symptoms. Third, women had higher depressive symptoms than men, and mediation analysis showed that stressful life events explained approximately a third of the gender gap in depressive symptoms. The findings indicate that policies attending to people's financial stress are important for mitigating mental health risks in turbulent times. Interventions that reduce women's exposure to stressful life events are also crucial to bridging gender disparities in mental health. © 2023 The Authors.

"Earth observation data provides valuable information and support along the disaster management cycle. However, information from satellite remote sensing is often not available in the first hours a crisis occurs, due to several reasons, e.g. pre-defined acquisition times, cloud coverage, downlink capacities. To fill this time gap and add value to the incoming results from remote sensing data, ancillary datasets such as Twitter data become useful to enrich data and get insights into events by leveraging their spatio-temporal and thematic references. However, the main disadvantage of using Twitter data is the noise that is introduced into analyses by these data. Among other reasons, this is mainly caused by the use of insignificant search criteria that are used to harvest the data, that often result in irrelevant, noisy data (e.g. using insignificant keywords or incorrect geotags to filter data). This paper presents a method to identify crisis-event specific signal words, that are then used together with Part Of Speech (POS) tagging to filter the Twitter streams, and gather crisis-event specific data. These data are then used to estimate the location hotspots of the crisis events. The developed methods are applied as a proof-of-concept to determine flood events in May of 2022. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This article identifies a cohort of screenplays and screenwriters recurrent on university screenwriting reading lists – a “screenwriting canon” –dominated by hegemonic identities. We identify some reasons for the perpetuation of this canon and its implications and limitations. We are especially concerned by the “hidden curriculum” within tertiary screenwriting courses and seek to expose the industry biases that shape its content and distribution. We find that the screenwriting canon, as distinct from other modes of creative writing and media practice, is shaped by a specific set of industrial values originating in Hollywood, which are expressed through regimes of access to certain texts and not others. These effectively determine what is allowed to count as “good” screenwriting. We argue that if the reading, analysis, discussion, performance and rewriting of screenplays is to be a useful tool for students then access to a greater diversity of screenplays is sorely needed. As educators, it is our responsibility to interrogate and critique the values of the screen industry rather than reproduce them. We make a case for accessing a wider range of screenplays and for introducing students to industry in a way that emphasises “work-ready” values, such as analysing power relations and ethical representation. © 2023, Australasian Association of Writing Programs.

"Introduction. Cadmium is widespread in the environment as a result of industrial activity, the use of agrochemicals, smoking. Children and adolescents are an eco-sensitive group of the population, and indicators of their physical and mental development are highly informative indicators of environmental impact. The purpose of the review was to study the effects of cadmium on the physical and mental development in children and adolescents. Search and selection of sources. A search was conducted for literature that is freely available using the search engines PubMed, Science Direct and eLibrary. The search was carried out by the ke-ywords: “effects of cadmium on the physical and mental development of children”, as well as on their individual indicators. The initial search allowed identifying seven thousand eight hundred sixty one reports, after an independent evaluation by two experts, 24 full-text publications remained. The inclusion criteria were: original data on the effect of cadmium on the development indicators in children and adolescents at any route of its entry into the body, a mathematically proven link between the level of cadmium with development indicators, taking into account the possibility of data bias. Results. The analysis of the subject matter and design of publications allowed establishing a limited set of criteria for assessing the physical and mental development (there are no indicators of dental maturity, puberty of boys, speech development, playing activity). Most studies indicate the effect of intrauterine exposure to cadmium on the body weight in newborns. The negative effect of cadmium on intellectual development begins to be determined in the senior preschool and school age and is also found in most studies. Contradictory data were obtained for the remaining indicators. Most researchers have not received data on sex differences when exposed to cadmium. Conclusion. Additional comprehensive randomized multicentric studies of the physical and mental development of children under the influence of cadmium, conducted according to a single protocol, are needed. © 2023 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

"The Ngạn people are a small local population of Tai-language speakers now living in the eastern districts of Cao Bằng province in northern Vietnam. They are said to be descendants of mercenary soldiers hired by the Mạc royal court during the 17th century. It is the aim of this article to investigate where they came from, using Vietnamese and Chinese ethnological studies, on-site fieldwork and analysis of song texts, supplemented by information from a ritual text and a family register. My conclusion is that the original homeland of the Ngạn was in the Youjiang River valley in west-central Guangxi. Numerous strands of evidence point to a strong connection with the native chieftaincy of Tianzhou and the neighbouring chieftaincy of Si’en. © David Holm, 2023."
"The article aims to focus on the problem of the ""difference of Manners"" in the eleventh chapter of Leviathan. Through the analysis of the text, it emerges how the problem posed here by Hobbes seems to recall in some way what emerges in Montaigne’s Essais, when he speaks of the diversity, or of the variety, of the mœurs. It is therefore a question of asking whether what Hobbes is talking about are ways of being individuals capable of reacting with greater or less pertinence to a given situation. Or if it is instead a question of rigidly codified behaviors, customs proper to a certain group or a certain population. It is therefore necessary to understand what role instruction and education by the public authority have in Leviathan in regulating and disciplining the conduct of the subjects and their ways of life, in order to ensure the maintenance of the political order. © 2023 Universita di Trieste.

"This paper proposes a theory of text on-screen as “unvoiceover.” It addresses both the case for captioning as social good and the affordances (aesthetic, affective) of writing in or over the moving image. Advancing an argument informed by perspectives from d/Deaf Studies, Critical Disability Studies and Digital Interface Studies, and applying modes of analysis from literary criticism alongside those proper to the study of moving image and sound, it examines the idiosyncrasies of text-in-motion as non-sonorous, fugitive counterpart to the traditional, troublesome “voiceover.” To develop a poetics of the unsounding voice on-screen, the paper focalizes its argument through multimedia artist Liza Sylvestre’s Captioned series: a body of moving image work that is itself, paradoxically, uncaptioned. Framing Sylvestre’s lyrical “unvoiceover” as a reimagining of the lost roles of film explainers and literary intertitles, I argue that the artist’s takeover of the caption track intervenes critically in contemporary debates about the ethics of audio-visual translation, situated description and access as public ethos rather than private concern. Posing the artist’s personal-and-political writing as suggestive of a lower-case analogue to Deaf Gain, I show how Sylvestre’s “unvoiceover” educates its “receivers” in the purpose and functioning of captions. By reading Sylvestre’s writing on-screen more closely than its fugitive form seems to invite, I show how the unvoiceover encultures its own demands on its readers and elicits its own habits of reading. By scrutinizing how Sylvestre’s series makes the case for captioning, this paper makes the case for a new appraisal of the aesthetic, affective and political affordances of the unvoiceover as writing on the run. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Currently, there appears to be a significant demand for addressing the image of Mother Earth. This study was in-tended to identify the main characteristics of the image of the spirit–mistress of the earth, Aan Alakhchyn Khotun, in the olonkho epic. Use was made of the structural, functional, and semantic analysis, as well as of the review and generalization, with the principle of historicism being the key one. The analysis has revealed the following stable signs of the image: being a female, a predominance of white color, nudity of breasts, elegant clothes, localization in the world tree, divine origin, and the functions of a nurse, protector, or adviser. A cane and a ladle in her hands or a shamanic tambourine and a mallet have been found to be characteristic attributes of the appearance. The natural prima materia and, in some texts, the anthropomorphic images (little people) of Ereke-Dyereke tend to accompany the arrival of Aan Alakhchyn Khotun. Emphasis is placed on the ornithomorphic hypostasis of the spirit of the words of the image in the form of a cuckoo. The early records demonstrate the phytomorphic hypostasis of the image in question in the form of a fusion of the images of the spirit of the tree and the hostess of the place. A conclu-sion is drawn that the semantic features of the image of Aan Alakhchyn Hotun reflect the multi-temporal nature of their historical appearances, suggesting further genetic studies to explore the archaic image of the spirit-mistress of the earth. © 2023, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Purpose: To develop a culturally-tailored American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women’s Facebook group supporting opioid recovery as an adjunct to medication. Design: Community-based, qualitative approach. Setting: Minnesota, U.S. Participants: AI/AN women in opioid recovery, interested parties, and a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) of AI/AN women with lived experience, health care providers, and community members. Intervention: We developed evidence-based content focusing on stress/trauma and substance use, mindfulness, responding to triggers, and supportive community resources. Additional content centered on AI/AN culture was also selected. Method: Interviews were conducted by two women, then transcribed and coded using content analysis with NVivo software. Results were presented to CAC for further content refinement. Results: CAC members (n = 10) guided study methods, intervention development, and dissemination activities. 14 AI/AN women (mean age 36.4 years; mean 6.7 months opioid abstinence) and 12 interested parties (7 men, 5 women) were receptive to an AI/AN gender-specific Facebook group, preferring content with AI/AN people and/or text resonating with AI/AN culture (e.g., Native traditions, family, personal stories, historical trauma). Recommendations included (1) protect confidentiality, (2) retain positivity, (3) incorporate resources and exercises to build coping skills, and (4) moderators should be authentic and relatable to build trust. Conclusions: Our approach provides a model for developing culturally tailored, appealing and effective social media interventions to support AI/AN women in recovery from opioid use disorder. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The purpose of the article is to identify the similarity of Abai’s and B. Pascal’s views regarding the categorical apparatus, key ideas, and specifics of the presentation. In the course of the study of this question, the historical-philosophical approach was chosen because of the need to study the core works in the context of the world’s history of thought. Hermeneutics was chosen to be the main method, which allows the free analysis and interpretation of texts, revealing their content from the perspective of non-classical forms of rationality. The eclectic method, together with general scientific analysis, synthesis, comparison and generalization in a complex, allows drawing parallels easily between directly unrelated sources and concepts. In the article, the belonging of Abai and B. Pascal’s philosophy to cordocentrism is determined, the categories of “heart”, “reason”, “will”, “faith”, “science” and their interconnection are revealed, the scope of genre affiliation of thinkers is expanded. © 2023, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

"The authenticity of political candidates has become a decisive factor in their evaluation by the public. In response, political candidates employ self-presentation techniques to appear genuine to constituents, and social media provides politicians with new tools to perform authenticity. Yet, we still know little about how politicians construct authentic images and how their gender and modes of self-presentation influence perceived authenticity. In this study, we examine how politicians’ gender (male vs female) and modes of self-presentation (text-only, image-only, and text–image combined) affect perceived political authenticity. Results from a 2 × 3 online survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,485) show that gender alone does not explain differences in perceived political authenticity when self-presentation is held consistently. Furthermore, we do not find significant effects for different self-presentation modes in social media. Additional analyses reveal that physical attractiveness is the primary factor for higher authenticity ratings in our sample. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Research on academic integrity used to focus more on student character and behaviour. Now this research includes wider viewing of this issue as a current teaching and learning challenge which requires pedagogical intervention. It is now the responsibility of staff and institutions to treat the creation of a learning environment supporting academic integrity as a teaching and learning priority. Plagiarism by simply copying other people’s work is a well-known misconduct which undermines academic integrity; moreover, technological developments have evolved plagiarism to include the generation and copying of computer-generated text. Automated paraphrasing tool (APT) websites have become increasingly common, offering students machine-generated rephrased text that students input from their own or others’ writing. These developments present a creeping erosion of academic integrity under the guise of legitimate academic assistance. This also has implications for arrival of large language model (LLM) generative AI tools. In accessing these sites, students must discern what is a legitimate use of the tool and what may constitute breaching academic integrity. This study critically analysed the text from five online paraphrasing websites to examine the discourses used to legitimise and encourage APT use in both appropriate and inappropriate ways. We conceptualised these competing discourses using Sheep and Wolf metaphors. In addition, we offer a metaphor of the Educator as a Shepherd to become aware of APT website claims and assist students to develop critical language awareness when exposed to these sites. Educators can assist students with this through knowledge of how these sites use language to entice users to circumvent learning. © by the authors."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks first among the causes of dementia worldwide. AD can develop a psychotic manifest at a significant rate. AD prognosis worsens by added psychosis clin-ic. There is no treatment approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) among antipsychotics for Alzheimer’s disease Psychosis (ADP). However, pimavanserine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been approved by the FDA for Parkinson's psychosis. It is predicted that pi-mavanserin, a new antipsychotic, will fill an important gap in this area. In clinical trials, it appears to be effective in the treatment of delusions and hallucinations at psychosis in both Parkinson's and AD. In this systematic review, we evaluated the analysis of current literature data on pimavanserin used in ADP. We searched the existing literature on clinical studies on pimavanserin therapy used in ADP. Data were determined by systematically searching PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar until December 2022. A total of 35 citations were found and uploaded on the Men-deley program. Abstracts and full texts of literature data were examined. Pimavanserin was ob-served, and satisfactory results were obtained in treating ADP. Pimavanserin has a unique mechanism of action. Pimavanserin, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has a low affinity for 5-HT2C receptors and has selective 5-HT2A reverse agonist/antagonist action. Pimavanserin has no clinically significant affinity for dopaminergic, histaminergic, muscarinic or adrenergic receptors. This agent may also achieve significant positive results in resistant psychosis treatments. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers."

"For the first time, a comparative analysis of the correlation between ritual verbal materials and rock paintings has been conducted from an interdisciplinary perspective encompassing folklore studies, ethnography, and archeology. The study focuses on four variants of scribbles and the rites performed in these mountains. The analysis has led to the conclusion that the de-scription of the drawing of a warrior on the mountain completely coincides with the rite dedi-cated to the mythological shamanic celestial Shargay-noyon. The second monument, dedicat-ed to a real warrior, has also been found to correspond to the ritual devoted to the spirit-guardian Boro-Sharga. Due to the ancient origin of the drawings on Mount Khashkhai, a par-Tial association with the ritual has been established, with the drawings being mentioned in the text of the ritual as a sign of the deity. No correlation has been identified between the earliest drawings from Mount Baitag and the rites conducted in the early 19th century and at present. The drawings matching in time with the verbal material of the ritual proved to have been in-Tentionally drawn by shamans or mythologized under the shamanic story. The ancient monu-ments of art on the revered mountains have been found to have no shamanic semantics. In the ritual text, however, they serve as sacred signs or are implied as messages from heaven to connect the two worlds. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"The paper determines the specifics of phonetic transformations in the synthesis of verbal analytical constructions (VACs) in the Khakass folklore, compared to the Shor and Tuvan heroic tales. The implementation of VACs in the Khakass heroic tale “Ai-Huuҷyn” was analyzed using auditory and instrumental methods, with speech pausation as the dominant marker. The analysis reveals the complete loss of external interword pauses that historically delimited the components of a verbal complex and determined their independent status. The modern folklore language retains only strong and moderate internal inter-syllabic pauses. The prevalence of constructions with a strong internal pause separating the main verb from the auxiliary and genetically ascending to the external interword pause indicates the incompleteness of the conversion of VACs into secondary synthetic forms at the phonetic level. Whether an affix is present or absent in the adverbial part of the main verb is also an important indicator of phonetic transformations of the verbal cluster. The prevalence of analytical combinations with the full form of the adverbial participle in the heroic tale text (69.4 % of the entire sample) indicates that, despite the active processes of the VAC synthesis, the positions of analytism remain quite stable. The comparison of the results obtained with the data on the Shor and Tuvan VACs demonstrates the common nature of phonotactic transformations of VACs due to the common Sayano-Altaic archetype. However, folklore languages exhibit varying degrees and rates of phonetic transformations that mark the processes of VAC synthesis. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Recent research has shown that multi-modal learning is a successful method for enhancing classification performance by mixing several forms of input, notably in speech-emotion recognition (SER) tasks. However, the difference between the modalities may affect SER performance. To overcome this problem, a novel approach for multi-modal SER called 3M-SER is proposed in this paper. The 3M-SER leverages multi-head attention to fuse information from multiple feature embeddings, including audio and text features. The 3M-SER approach is based on the SERVER approach but includes an additional fusion module that improves the integration of text and audio features, leading to improved classification performance. To further enhance the correlation between the modalities, a LayerNorm is applied to audio features prior to fusion. Our approach achieved an unweighted accuracy (UA) and weighted accuracy (WA) of 79.96% and 80.66%, respectively, on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset. This indicates that the proposed approach is better than SERVER and recent methods with similar approaches. In addition, it highlights the effectiveness of incorporating an extra fusion module in multi-modal learning. © 2023, © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."
"This study aims to explore how verb frames can potentially influence text difficulty and shed new light on text evaluation. Different from previous works focusing mostly on lexical frequencies, this paper explores semantic categories of verbs and their correlation with the difficulty levels (DLs) of textbooks. Based on a corpus of nine sets of primary school Chinese textbooks, verb-frame diversity and distribution trends by difficulty levels were examined. The results show that the diversity of verb frames has a strong positive correlation with difficulty levels. The distribution trends of the frames largely correspond with the three cognitive tiers proposed in the skill theory for language development: the sensory–motor, representational, and abstract tiers. This study introduces verb frames as a salient semantic factor in text analysis and proposes that verb-frame-related features have the potential to be utilized in the evaluation of leveled instructional materials and readability assessment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"The research deals with the emergence of the concept of semiotics as an entrance to design and its relationship to different design trends, in addition to the role of semiotics in design in general and architecture in particular, studying its importance in achieving communication between the recipient and the architectural text, and discussing the appropriateness and flexibility of the elements or tools of semiotic analysis in reading and analyzing the texts of the visual language of architecture. To define the research problem with the ambiguity of scientific knowledge about the impact of the semiotic design strategy on the formation of meaning in the context of contemporary local architecture and its goal is to explore the impact of the semiotic design strategy on the formation of meaning in contemporary local architecture and the appropriateness and flexibility of applying the semiotic approach to understanding and analyzing the language of architecture and the meanings behind the apparent physical formation of works architectural © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd.

"Previously, this text reviewed how to conduct a statistical analysis of the means of two groups with a t-test. It is easy to imagine situations, however, where one would wish to compare the means between three or more groups, in which the t-test would be limiting or inadequate for this end purpose. In its most basic form, the statistical tool known as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows one to do just that: compare the means for three or more samples/groups to determine if a significant difference exists between them. ANOVA also allows one to test for interactions between multiple factors, which may or may not influence outcomes independently on their own. There are a wide variety of ways in which the ANOVA technique is applicable. This chapter will review what ANOVA is, and what ANOVA indicates. Additionally, this chapter will go through two similar but distinct stepwise processes of calculating a one-way and two-way ANOVA by hand. These will be accomplished through the use of hypothetical and illustrative Radiation Oncology related scenarios. This chapter will also briefly define concepts of repeated measures ANOVA, analysis of covariance(ANCOVA), multiple analyses of variance(MANOVA), and factorial ANOVA. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Humans often use co-speech gestures to promote effective communication. Attention has been paid to the cortical areas engaged in the processing of co-speech gestures. Aims: To investigate the neural network underpinned in the processing of co-speech gestures and to observe whether there is a relationship between areas involved in language and gesture processing. Methods & Procedures: We planned to include studies with neurotypical and/or stroke participants who underwent a bimodal task (i.e., processing of co-speech gestures with relative speech) and a unimodal task (i.e., speech or gesture alone) during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. After a database search, abstract and full-text screening were conducted. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed with the software GingerALE 3.0.2, performing contrast analyses of uni- and bimodal tasks. Main Contribution: The database search produced 1024 records. After the screening process, 27 studies were included in the review. Data from 15 studies were quantitatively analysed through meta-analysis. Meta-analysis found three clusters with a significant activation of the left middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. Conclusions: There is a close link at the neural level for the semantic processing of auditory and visual information during communication. These findings encourage the integration of the use of co-speech gestures during aphasia treatment as a strategy to foster the possibility to communicate effectively for people with aphasia. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject Gestures are an integral part of human communication, and they may have a relationship at neural level with speech processing. What this paper adds to the existing knowledge During processing of bi- and unimodal communication, areas related to semantic processing and multimodal processing are activated, suggesting that there is a close link between co-speech gestures and spoken language at a neural level. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Knowledge of the functions related to gesture and speech processing neural networks will allow for the adoption of model-based neurorehabilitation programs to foster recovery from aphasia by strengthening the specific functions of these brain networks. © 2023 The Authors.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing in many biomedical areas. The field of genetics and genomics has long been tied to rapidly evolving technologies, such as involving both the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data. It is thus logical that multiple types and aspects of AI technology, including deep learning, have already been integrated into many parts of this field and are anticipated to continue to expand in both overall use and types of applications. In this chapter, we outline four AI applications in medical genetics including analyses of medical images, text-based datasets, genomic and other ‘omic data, and explorations of generative or synthetic data. This chapter is not meant to be comprehensive but intends to offer examples of selected ways in which AI is leveraged in medical genetics. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Objectives/Scope: Wood aims to introduce a novel approach for rapidly and effectively benchmarking maintenance and reliability in the upstream and midstream oil and gas sectors. The proposed method will provide valuable insights at both macro (overall build) and micro (individual maintenance items) levels, with the goal of improving asset performance management and setting new industry standards. This approach promotes collaboration among industry peers and sharing of best practices, driving overall industry progress. Methods, Procedures, Process: Our approach uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to match short text descriptions from multiple maintenance builds, utilizing techniques ranging from Jaccard similarity to state-of-the-art language model embeddings. In-house developed denoising algorithms remove unnecessary information to clarify the text, addressing potential issues of data quality and consistency. This process allows for the identification of similar tasks, which then serve as key columns to match the entire build, facilitating effective benchmarking and enabling more accurate comparisons. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The proposed method enables swift benchmarking among maintenance builds and allows for frequent comparison at both micro and macro levels. This overcomes the limitations of traditional manual matching processes, which are time-consuming, costly, and error prone. By determining the optimal frequency of maintenance intervention to minimize cost and carbon footprint while maximizing reliability, our approach highlights the power of data- driven decisions to enhance asset reliability and streamline maintenance processes. The method fosters a culture of collaboration among industry peers, promoting the sharing of best practices and driving overall industry progress. Moreover, it has been shown to provide valuable insights that can be leveraged for continuous improvement and to address common challenges in asset performance management and maintenance practices. Novel/Additive Information: In contrast to traditional methods that rely on Failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) tables, subjective understanding, or manual matching, our approach revolutionizes benchmarking using natural language processing and data-driven methodologies. This ground-breaking contribution takes away manual time and expense, improving efficiency and ensuring that the changes implemented are data-backed. These leads to continuous improvement in maintenance and reliability practices within the energy industry, ultimately enhancing asset performance management and reliability standards. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Introduction: The short message service is an alternative to telephone follow-up of exposure cases reported to poison centres. The aim of this study was to compare the proportion of exposure cases successfully followed up and the respective cost of telephone and short message service follow-up between two poison centres, one using both methods of follow-up (Paris centre) and the other using telephone follow-up only (Nancy centre). Methods: In 2021, we included cases eligible for short message service follow-up at both centres. Eligibility criteria were calls from the public reporting non-toxic or minor toxic exposure not requiring medical consultation. We collected the follow-up type (telephone/short message service) and outcome (success/failure). The cost of each type of follow-up was estimated. Results: In 2021, 16,867 and 11,107 exposure cases were eligible for short message service follow-up at the Paris and Nancy centres, respectively. The Paris centre followed up 86.2% of cases by short message service, and the remainder by telephone, while the Nancy centre followed up all cases by telephone. The Paris centre had a greater follow-up rate compared to the Nancy centre (93.0% versus 43.6%; P < 0.0001). Overall, the success rates were similar between the two centres (P = 0.06), with short message service and telephone follow-up showing comparable success rates (88.1% versus 88.7%; P = 0.25). On average, telephone follow-up took almost twice as long (1.51 min versus 0.85 min) and cost 1.3 times more (0.59 euros versus 0.45 euros) than short message service follow-up. Discussion: Short message service follow-up allows more patients to be successfully followed up at a lower cost compared to telephone-only follow-up, albeit with potential differences in information quality. Conclusions: Short message service follow-up is a promising tool for poison centres to follow up with patients. Further studies are needed to assess the quality of the data collected and caller satisfaction. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This article offers a means of analysing social networking, visual dialogues of emojis, gif s (images in the Graphics Interchange Format), embedded images, videos, and url s (Uniform Resource Locators). Doing so addresses these often overlooked and undervalued forms of visual communication, suggesting a unique means of gaining insights into their use within online interactions. Utilising a Bakhtinian methodology, the author extracts excerpts from her research, situated within Facebook, to demonstrate a Bakhtinian genre analysis, a framework that the author contends is adaptable to multiple social networking spaces. Highlighting emojis, gif s, embedded images, videos, and url s as integral components of online communication, an emphasis is placed on how the text dances with the visual, presenting a nuanced framework for such an analysis. Consequently, an argument is developed for the significance of visual dialogues in contemporary online spaces, and the need for researchers to better understand these dynamic forms of communication, offered through Bakhtinian dialogism.  © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Podcasting is the process of creating and distributing digital audio files, which, together with explanatory text and possible non-verbal materials, are posted on online platforms in the form of serial episodes for subsequent download to users' fixed and mobile devices. The aim of the article is to study Russian podcasting as an element of modern online reality and the subject of academic reflection. From a theoretical and methodological point of view, the study is based on academic publications on the problems of podcasting, media research, teaching aids, as well as recommendations and cases of practicing podcasters. The study used the podcast chart on the popular streaming service Yandex Music as its empirical base. The research method is discourse analysis which studied: 1) the functions of podcasts; 2) communication channels; 3) authors and target audience; 4) typological and structural characteristics of media products; and 5) pragmatic context of communication. The study shows that podcasts perform a variety of functions (informing, consolidating, recreating, teaching, enlightening, creativity, pragmatic realization), thus satisfying a broad range of needs for contemporary users aimed at improving the quality of life. The technological aspect of podcasting includes the following: production of media products, their placement on online platforms, and the use of technical devices for listening. The study also considers sources which enable Russians to expand their knowledge in this sector of information literacy, as well as obtain up-to-date data on the conditions of audio content usage. A study of communicative actors has shown that at the present time a range of types of podcast producers are represented in the Russian media market. These include: media, production studios; organizations outside the media industry; and independent podcasters. They are involved in the creation of media products mainly for a young audience with a certain predominance of women, many of whom are located in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The systematization of Russian-language podcasts on Yandex Music allowed establishing a typology based on five criteria for the differentiation of media products: correlation with the news agenda; thematic categories; the number of subject lines; communication strategies; and genre characteristics. A structural study identified mandatory (title, cover, podcast description, audio tracks) and optional (trailer, episode description) podcast elements. These features were analysed for their semiotic organization. Special attention was paid to integrated marketing communications in the field of podcasting. This included project promotion tools (special communication techniques in audio tracks; social networks featured on streaming platforms; joint publications with other podcasts, online guest resources), as well as ways to monetize Russian-language podcasts (crowdfunding, advertising, exclusive paid content). © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"Vast amounts of complex information are created in the processes of healthcare. This chapter delineates three categories of computational readiness of that information: native data that is analytics (and AI) ready, discrete data that must be translated to be computationally ready, and unstructured documentation. Unfortunately, 80%–90% of healthcare information is unstructured, locked in the vagaries and imprecision of verbose text. To understand the journey to good data, a high-level data framework is reviewed, specifically the concepts of common data elements, analysis-ready data structures, and common data models. Initiatives such as the federal USCDI and the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming interfaces are acknowledged as accelerators of data liquidity that will enable AI. Finally, the need for transformation of healthcare itself is recognized—specifically, a call for the reengineering of healthcare where the capture of good data occurs at the point of care via a computationally intensive environment that actually reduces clinician burden. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"Purpose: Positive experiences with working from home (WFH) during the Corona pandemic (COVID-19) have motivated many employees to continue WFH after the pandemic. However, factors influencing employees' WFH intentions against the backdrop of experiences during pandemic-induced enforced working from home (EWFH) are heterogeneous. This study investigates factors linked to information technology (IT) professionals' WFH intentions. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed-methods study with 92 IT professionals examines the effects of seven predictors for IT professionals' WFH intentions. The predictors are categorized according to the trichotomy of (1) characteristics of the worker, (2) characteristics of the workspace and (3) the work context. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the quantitative survey data. In addition, IT professionals' responses to six open questions in which they reflect on past experiences and envision future work are examined. Findings: Quantitative results suggest that characteristics of the worker, such as segmentation preference, are influencing WFH intentions stronger than characteristics of the workspace or the work context. Furthermore, perceived productivity during EWFH and gender significantly predict WFH intentions. Contextualizing these quantitative insights, the qualitative data provides a rich yet heterogeneous list of factors why IT professionals prefer (not) to work from home. Practical implications: Reasons influencing WFH intentions vary due to individual preferences and constraints. Therefore, a differentiated organizational approach is recommended for designing future work arrangements. In addition, the findings suggest that team contracts to formalize working patterns, e.g. to agree on the needed number of physical meetings, can be helpful levers to reduce the complexity of future work that is most likely a mix of WFH and office arrangements. Originality/value: This study extends literature reflecting on COVID-19-induced changes, specifically the emerging debate about why employees want to continue WFH. It is crucial for researchers and practitioners to understand which factors influence IT professionals' WFH intentions and how they impact the design and implementation of future hybrid work arrangements. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"One of the most important aspects of human life is health. Every civilization is paying more attention to the early detection of a disease with its prevention along with implementing technology in the area of healthcare. The use of technology helps in identifying the most effective treatments for a variety of chronic illnesses. Deep learning (DL) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are rapidly expanding and playing an extremely important role in a wide range of applications such as healthcare and medical systems. Getting knowledge and useful insights from sophisticated, high-dimensional, and diverse biological data remain a major problem in healthcare transformation. The various kinds of data, such as electronic health records (EHRs) or electric medical records (EMRs), sensor data, text, and imaging, are all examples of variable, poorly documented, complex, and unstructured data that have emerged in modern biomedical research. As of now, COVID-19 has been wreaking havoc on the world since December 2019. Fortunately, the IoT is among the most significant paradigms in which artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as big data analysis and cloud computing are playing a critical role in order to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. For instance, in the case of diagnosis and remote screening of COVID-19 patients, AI technology based on machine learning (ML) and DL has redefined the flow of work by having minimum contact with patients, moreover, allowing healthcare professionals to make clinical decisions in a more efficient manner, thus, helping in protecting not only patients but also healthcare professionals. Thus, in healthcare, the IoT plays a critical role in providing patients with better medical facilities as well as supporting hospitals and healthcare professionals. Because of IoT-enabled portable medical equipment, smart healthcare surveillance systems are on the rise. This chapter mainly focuses on the various approaches enabled by AI and DL and their significant applications in the field of medical and healthcare. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Social cognition remains one of the most difficult cognitive domains to assess in diverse populations due to a lack of culturally appropriate tools. This study systematically reviewed literature on neuropsychological tests for social cognition that have been translated, adapted, are cross-cultural, or are assembled for diverse, specifically “Global South,” populations. The aim was to identify assessments appropriate for diverse populations, outline and evaluate their methodological approaches, and provide procedural recommendations for future research. The PRISMA systematic review search strategy produced 10,957 articles, of which 287 were selected for full-text screening. The study had to include a neuropsychological assessment of social cognition. The full text of the resulting 287 articles was then screened; the study had to include a translated, adapted, cross-cultural test, or an assembled test for Global South populations. Eighty-four articles were included in this study: 24 for emotion recognition, 45 for theory of mind, 9 for moral reasoning, and six for social cognition in general. Overall, there were 31 translations, 27 adaptations, 14 cross-cultural tests, and 12 assembled tests for Global South populations. Regarding quality, 35 were of low quality, 27 were of moderate quality, and 22 were high quality. This study provides an overview of social cognition tests modified or assembled for diverse populations and gives examples of methodological procedures. It highlights the variability in procedure quality and provides possible reasons for this variability. Finally, it suggests a need to report rigorous modification and assembly procedure in order to have modified and assembled social cognition tests appropriate for diverse populations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: Dementia is a cognitive decline that leads to the progressive deterioration of an individual's ability to perform daily activities independently. As a result, a considerable amount of time and resources are spent on caretaking. Early detection of dementia can significantly reduce the effort and resources needed for caretaking. Aims: This research proposes an approach for assessing cognitive decline by analysing speech data, specifically focusing on speech relevance as a crucial indicator for memory recall. Methods & Procedures: This is a cross-sectional, online, self-administered. The proposed method used deep learning architecture based on transformers, with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Sentence-Transformer to derive encoded representations of speech transcripts. These representations provide contextually descriptive information that is used to analyse the relevance of sentences in their respective contexts. The encoded information is then compared using cosine similarity metrics to measure the relevance of uttered sequences of sentences. The study uses the Pitt Corpus Dementia dataset for experimentation, which consists of speech data from individuals with and without dementia. The accuracy of the proposed multi-QA-MPNet (Multi-Query Maximum Inner Product Search Pretraining) model is compared with other pretrained transformer models of Sentence-Transformer. Outcomes & Results: The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other models in capturing context level information, particularly semantic memory. Additionally, the study explores the suitability of different similarity measures to evaluate the relevance of uttered sequences of sentences. The experimentation reveals that cosine similarity is the most appropriate measure for this task. Conclusions & Implications: This finding has significant implications for the early warning signs of dementia, as it suggests that cosine similarity metrics can effectively capture the semantic relevance of spoken language. The persistent cognitive decline over time acts as one of the indicators for prevalence of dementia. Additionally early dementia could be recognised by analysis on other modalities like speech and brain images. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject It is already known that speech- and language-based detection methods can be useful for dementia diagnosis, as language difficulties are often early signs of the disease. Additionally, deep learning algorithms have shown promise in detecting and diagnosing dementia through analysing large datasets, particularly in speech- and language-based detection methods. However, further research is needed to validate the performance of these algorithms on larger and more diverse datasets and to address potential biases and limitations. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study presents a unique and effective approach for cognitive decline assessment through analysing speech data. The study provides valuable insights into the importance of context and semantic memory in accurately detecting the potential in dementia and demonstrates the applicability of deep learning models for this purpose. The findings of this study have important clinical implications and can inform future research and development in the field of dementia detection and care. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The proposed approach for cognitive decline assessment using speech data and deep learning models has significant clinical implications. It has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of dementia diagnosis, leading to earlier detection and more effective treatments, which can improve patient outcomes and quality of life. © 2023 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists."
"Estimating the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on enterprise ambidextrous innovation can provide insight into firms’ current innovation choice orientation, but few studies systematically reveal the relationship between the two. We have developed a new investment valuation construct that includes three parts: the direct net present value, growth option value, and strategic preemption value. Based on this, we systematically expound the relationship between EPU and enterprise ambidextrous innovation and explore the moderating effect of government subsidies and managerial ownership. Using the patent text mining data of Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2019 and exploiting the world average temperature as an instrument for EPU, we find that EPU promotes enterprise’s exploitative innovation and inhibits enterprise’s exploratory innovation through the redistribution of R&D investment in ambidextrous innovation. Government subsidies negatively moderate the relationship between EPU and enterprise exploitative innovation, but have no moderating effect on the relationship between EPU and enterprise exploratory innovation. While managerial ownership positively moderates the relationship between EPU and enterprise exploitative innovation, no evidence of a moderating effect was found in the relationship between EPU and enterprise exploratory innovation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

This paper starts from the risks and events that ChatGPT has recently faced, proposes a framework for analyzing cybersecurity in cyberspace, and envisions adversarial models and systems. It puts forward a new evolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders using ChatGPT to enhance their own capabilities in a changing environment and predicts the future development of ChatGPT from a security perspective.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: Reading Comprehension skills are fundamental to the academic performance of university students. These abilities are not innate; therefore, systematic training is required before entering university. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the reading comprehension skills of Chilean University Students. Method: A sample of 579 students participated in the study, responding to four texts that comprise the Reading Comprehension Strategies for University Students (ELCU). An automated platform was used to apply and correct the test with immediate results and feedback. The tool allowed the use of a broad and representative sample of the various regions of Chile. The ELCU was developed using a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) considering cognitive, metacognitive and linguistic strategies. The analyses were performed using two different approaches: The Linear Logistic Test Model (LLTM) and the deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate (DINA) model. Results: The rejection of the LLTM implies that the strategies do not differ in cognitive complexity (difficulty) while the ade-quate goodness of fit to the DINA model allows to characterise the students according to their reading abilities. Conclusion: The ELCU test provides reliable and valid information on the reading comprehension ability and metacognitive awareness of university students. © 2023 Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz."
"Background: A list of drugs that can induce takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) was published in 2011 and 2016. The aim of the present review was to update this list. Methods: Similar to the 2011 and 2016 reviews, from April 2015 to May 2022 case reports of druginduced TCM were identified by a comprehensive search in Medline/PubMed database. The search terms were: takotsubo cardiomyopathy, tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, transientleft-ventricular ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, ampulla cardiomyopathy OR broken heart syndrome; together with “iatrogenic”, “induced by” OR “drug-induced”. Registers published in English or Spanish, in humans, and with full texts were retrieved. Articles that recognized any drug associated with the development of TCM were selected. Results: Overall, 184 manuscripts were identified by the search. A total of 39 articles were included after an exhaustive revision. Eighteen drugs as possible triggers of TCM were identified in the current update. Of them, 3 (16.7%) have been previously identified, and 15 (83.3%) are different from the previous reports. Thus, the list of drugs as possible triggers of TCM updated in 2022 includes 72 drugs. Conclusion: There are new case reports that link drugs with the development of TCM. The current list is principally made up of drugs that generate sympathetic overstimulation. However, some of the listed drugs do not have a clear link with sympathetic activation. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers."
"The main aspiration of this article is that the brief notes it contains can foster a political debate on the possibility of establishing a renewed, multifactorial and multiscale relationship between the city of Florence, its territorial context and the river that runs through them (the Arno), in order to reconsider it on the basis of a unconventional point of view and from an ecofeminist perspective, not only in spatial and physical terms but also in temporal and sociocultural terms. The work methodology adopted combines documentary-type bibliographic research with experience and direct observation of the places analysed. The text is structured in a first part in which new views and a renewed theoretical framework for analysis and critical reading of the current situation are proposed, in a second more historiographical part which very briefly explores in what terms the relationship and interaction between city, territory and river has favoured the development of certain activities at the expense of others, in a third part of discussion of the analysed data and, finally, in a conclusive part in which potential cultural, economic and spatial strategies are outlined to renovate that relationship. © 2023 Universidad de Sevilla.

"In tourism destination image research, topic modeling, mutual relationships among keywords, and image evolution trends have received limited attention. Filling these gaps in the extant literature, based on tourist gaze theory, this study is the first to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation, text visualization, and topic evolution trend methods to explore the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes’ image. Analyzing 22,371 reviews posted on tourism social networks, we find that (1) prominence, uniqueness, a rich culture, convenience, and enormous influence are five dimensions of the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes’ image; (2) these dimension keywords display different cooccurrence relationships; and (3) the dimension evolution trends vary in direction and degree. Our study enriches existing literature and provides important practical implications for the destination marketing field. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Having a clear understanding of future trends is essential for producers in the animation industry to navigate effectively, as it can impact various aspects of project deployment, including creativity and employment. In this paper, we first utilize several machine-learning models, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, and MLP classifier, to predict the anime class using web-scraped anime data. Then, we propose a decision tree algorithm using both Gini index and Entropy to explain the clustering and classification models built on tf-idf embeddings on the text information of animes, e.g., name, genre, and type. Specifically, this decision tree algorithm helps us to understand the important features that the clustering and classification models rely on and why certain animes are classified as popular, and vice versa. The overall accuracy of the decision tree with depth 3 is 80.6%. The study reveals that the score of each anime is significantly influenced by its number of episodes and members. Other factors, such as the anime’s name, also contribute to the scoring of anime. We further conducted a word frequency analysis on the names of anime to differentiate between popular and unpopular anime. It is important to note that future research is necessary to investigate other factors that may impact the score of each anime, including malicious comments, untruthful responses, and data collection methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Background: There is no consensus on tests required to either diagnose unexplained infertility or use for research inclusion criteria. This leads to heterogeneity and bias affecting meta-analysis and best practice advice. Objectives: This systematic review analyses the variability of inclusion criteria applied to couples with unexplained infertility. We propose standardised criteria for use both in future research studies and clinical diagnosis. Search strategy: CINAHL and MEDLINE online databases were searched up to November 2022 for all published studies recruiting couples with unexplained infertility, available in full text in the English language. Data collection and analysis: Data were collected in an Excel spreadsheet. Results were analysed per category and methodology or reference range. Main results: Of 375 relevant studies, only 258 defined their inclusion criteria. The most commonly applied inclusion criteria were semen analysis, tubal patency and assessment of ovulation in 220 (85%), 232 (90%), 205 (79.5%) respectively. Only 87/220 (39.5%) studies reporting semen analysis used the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. Tubal patency was accepted if bilateral in 145/232 (62.5%) and if unilateral in 24/232 (10.3%). Ovulation was assessed using mid-luteal serum progesterone in 115/205 (56.1%) and by a history of regular cycles in 87/205 (42.4%). Other criteria, including uterine cavity assessment and hormone profile, were applied in less than 50% of included studies. Conclusions: This review highlights the heterogeneity among studied populations with unexplained infertility. Development and application of internationally accepted criteria will improve the quality of research and future clinical care. © 2023 The Authors.

"The study presents a conceptual model that uses generative AI to automate project scheduling for complex oil and gas capital projects. The model uses historical project schedules and expert-built process maps to generate a full-scale schedule including dependencies, resources, and duration. The study highlights the limitations of traditional scheduling methods based solely on planner ability and discusses the potential benefits of using AI, including improved accuracy and efficiency. The conceptual model aims to address project schedule issues and the model begins by collecting data from past projects to create a historical database, which is used to train a generative AI algorithm to perfect the process maps. Process maps serve as a visual representation of the project schedule, detailing the steps and dependencies involved in a project, and are used to find potential issues or bottlenecks in the schedule and recommend solutions based on historical data. Text summarization and cataloging techniques are used to extract key information and categorize them based on project type, driver, size, stage, etc. After examining the available literature and conducting a market analysis, it was found that the potential solutions for oil and gas scheduling requirements were not enough. The quality of the project schedule can be affected by several factors, leading to associated integrity issues, project delays, cost overruns, and other negative consequences. Addressing these challenges upfront requires a robust and reliable method that incorporates historical data, process maps, and AI-driven analysis to create accurate and transparent project schedules. Observations revealed that the model's ability to learn from historical project schedules and expert knowledge was crucial to its success. The use of expert-built process maps supplied a comprehensive and accurate framework for generating project schedules, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the generative AI algorithm. The proposed model offers a streamlined approach to project scheduling that can help reduce the potential for human error and improve project outcomes. The use of generative AI for project scheduling has the potential to revolutionize the oil and gas industry by supplying a more efficient and accurate method for managing complex projects. Further research and development of this approach can lead to continued improvements in accuracy and efficiency, ultimately leading to better project outcomes. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"While the world is battling COVID-19 pandemic and its variants; netizens are combating Infodemic – “Proliferation of fake news online”. Spread of fake news during this global pandemic COVID-19 has dangerous consequences. Precise automated fake news detection is the need of the hour. This is the driving force behind this study. Intrinsic quality of news data: precision and objectivity can be studied to detect the credibility. However, to gain the knowledge or inference from it further it is a challenge. To address this challenge, this work proposes derivation of features into two categories: intrinsic word level features (Fine-grained) and sentence level features (Coarse- grained).For experimentation, fine-grained features are learned from word vector representation of the news articles. Psycho-linguistic and sentiment level word level features are derived using Empath library. Coarse-grained features (sentence-level) comprise of vectors generated by Text summarization and DOC2Vec. Taking the advantages of existing approaches, this paper proposes a new framework Granularity based Fake news Detection (GRAFED) that explores fusion of fine and coarse-grained features. The fusion of feature set is more powerful than individual fine or coarse-grained feature sets as they can capture complex interdependence of words in the sentence along with the semantics. Exhaustive experimentation using traditional classifiers with hybrid granular feature vector of GRAFED outperformed the existing approaches for publicly available state-of-art LIAR dataset. Experimental results show that the hybrid feature set is superior to individual feature set and the results are promising when compared to the existing state-of-art approaches as analyzed in the comparative analysis section. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The paper analyzes the repertoire of the prefaces in Russian memoirs of the second half of the 18th to the early 19th century as a metatextual component of the narrative. Consideration is given to the authors’ orientation towards potential readers and the specificity of prefaces in memoir texts during that period. The preface composition may comprise several phrases or represent a more voluminous fragment. It may not be an independent structural element and represents a kind of “beginning,” functionally coinciding with the preface. The memoirs can be divided into three groups based on the presence and design of the preface: texts without a preface, texts with a pronounced preface, and texts in which the fragments at the beginning of the narrative perform the function of pre-notification. The corpus of memoir texts is analyzed within the context of the cultural and literary epoch of the 18th century, making it possible to identify the main trends in the motivations cited by memoirists as an explanation for their literary work. A comparative analysis of memoir prefaces of the 18th century has revealed the significant shifts in understanding the goals of writing memoirs by memoirists, reflecting the change in the authors’ attitudes to the history of the past they record and the image of themselves they describe. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a common condition affecting the musculoskeletal group evoking clinical signs such as pain, restricted mouth opening, and disability in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory musculature, and the osseous structures in the surroundings. Saliva is a strong proponent of a diagnostic and prognostic tool for TMDs. Hence, a systematic review was undertaken to answer the research question 'What is the role of salivary biomarkers in the identification of TMD?' A thorough literature search was performed in databases of PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar till February 2022. Every included study was characterized by Study ID, location, sample size, demographic information, biomarker analysis, assessment method, and results. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodological quality of all qualifying research. A total of eight articles were included for the review after screening the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. The review included articles of observational design with a control group. TMD disorders were confirmed both clinically and radiographically in the study of Shoukri et al. TMDs are commonly prevalent in maxillofacial conditions. Despite the availability of various diagnostic techniques, certain limitations are remarkable. The researchers are yet to ascertain a gold standard biomarker to identify TMD.  © 2023 National Journal of Maxillofacial Surgery."
"The Indian graphic novel has been seen as marking a new turn in the tradition of Indian graphic fiction. Upturning the narrative and thematic conventions of graphic narratives like the Amar Chitra Katha, it uses a variety of expressive resources from popular culture, art and literature to create a heteroglossia of words and images. The unconventionality of the medium often enables the reader to approach the text in new, unconventional ways. Moving away from the concerns of national identity (in ACK), to exploring complex issues of identity in a globalized urban setting, Indian graphic fiction has come a long way. Within the framework of postmodernity, a heteroglossic text reveals fissures in its ideological configuration where ontological binaries such as male-female/queer, man/woman, human/machine and belonging/estrangement are not only disrupted but also challenged. This chapter analyses the visual and verbal strategies that Patil's graphic novel, Kari, employs to represent identity and gender not as unitary concepts but as fluid ones. It focuses on the subversion of hegemonic capitalist and patriarchal frameworks for gender and identity that are represented in the text through the commodified and fetishized images of masculinity, femininity and queerness that saturate Kari's world, and, through the representation of her home/house in the “smog-city” of Bombay. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Nabanita Sengupta and Samrita Sengupta Sinha; individual chapters, the contributors."
"The objective of this paper is to share and introduce the Wells Around Formation Issues [WAFI] tool, which was developed by Petroleum Development Oman LLC [PDO] - collaboration between Well Engineering and Data Science teams. This tool's function is to extract Formation Issues from the Daily Drilling Operation Reports [DDOR\ & Other Reports entered by Drilling Site team and display them per formation per field. WAFI is a cutting-edge Well Engineering solution that employs Text Mining techniques to automatically provide offset well information, significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing manual labor spent on data extraction from disparate databases and analysis in Excel. This advanced solution facilitates a deeper understanding of complex relationships between neighboring wells and the well to be drilled. By optimizing this process, our approach aims to effectively pinpoint potential challenge areas, thereby augmenting drilling operations and sustaining overall project success. The tool was trialed in 3 fields in PDO, and it managed to pick up most of the drilling and formation issues identified and expected in each field and in offset wells, based on the Trained Machine Learning Model. The tool picks up the Depth at which the issue occurred, and it links it to the Formation being drilled. The results are viewed in a formation level view or at a Well level view, so it will give an overview of the field issues in offset wells. This will help Team for better planning and preparing for the upcoming wells, and of understanding of the Fields issues. The tool picks up the following Issues: Tight spots, Over Pulls, Reaming and Back Reaming, Vibrations, Stick & Slip, Bit Balling, Fish, Lost Circulation, Fluid Influx, Stuck Pipe & Drill String Failure. The parameters being picked by the model are: Loss Rate range, Flow Rate, Torque, RPM, Overpull and ROP [Rate of Penetration]. This is Phase One of the Tool development, and next plan for Phase Two will include more functionalities and more features, Parameters and enhancements to the tool. Both phases will be discussed in this paper. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Background: People with aphasia (PWA) frequently experience difficulties in understanding longer written content such as paragraphs or books. Reading strategies are a promising approach to treat text-level reading comprehension deficits in PWA. Nevertheless, empirical evidence for their efficacy remains rare. Aims: The primary objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a strategy-based intervention on text-level reading comprehension in PWA. Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of two strategy-based intervention components and to explore potential moderator effects. Methods & Procedures: A protocol was published prior to data acquisition. In a repeated measures trial, 26 German participants with chronic, post-stroke aphasia participated in a waiting period without aphasia treatment (control condition) followed by a strategy-based intervention called ‘Strategiebasierte Textverständnis-Therapie bei Aphasie’ (StraTexT, 14 face-to-face-sessions, twice per week, 60 min each). Two strategy combinations, Intervention Micro targeting microstructure and Intervention Macro targeting macrostructure, were applied to newspaper and magazine articles. Participants were randomly allocated to two parallel groups that received these strategy combinations in interchanged sequences. Assessments were implemented before and after each period as well as 3 and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was text-level reading comprehension measured with the total score of a German version of the Test de Compréhension de Textes (TCT-D). Secondary outcome measures addressed the self-reported perception of reading abilities, reading activities and feelings about reading (German version of the Comprehensive Assessment of Reading in Aphasia CARA reading questionnaire) as well as selected cognitive functions. Outcomes & Results: The per-protocol-analysis included data from 22 participants. We found significant small improvements up to 6 months post-intervention compared to pre-intervention in the TCT-D Total (d = 0.35–0.46) as well as medium to large improvements in the CARA questionnaire (d = 0.68–0.96). Up to 3 months after the intervention, treatment-induced improvements in the TCT-D Total were significantly larger than change without treatment during the control condition. There was no evidence of moderator effects. Furthermore, we found improvements in several cognitive functions. Conclusions & Implications: Reading strategies can lead to long-term improvements in text-level reading comprehension and in self-reported reading abilities, feelings about reading and reading activities in aphasia. In regular clinical settings, it seems reasonable to implement both Intervention Micro and Intervention Macro. It remains important to investigate participant characteristics that contribute to treatment success. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Systematic reviews and multiple case studies suggest that reading strategies are a promising approach to treat text-level reading comprehension in aphasia. The efficacy of reading strategies has been demonstrated for different populations. However, to date no group study has evaluated the efficacy of reading strategies on text-level reading comprehension in people with aphasia. What this study adds This study provides the first group-level evidence about the efficacy of a systematic strategy-based intervention in 22 people with post-stroke chronic aphasia. During 14 treatment sessions, participants applied four reading strategies to newspaper and magazine articles within two intervention components called Intervention Micro and Intervention Macro (two strategies per intervention component). We found improvements in text-level reading comprehension for at least 3 months post-intervention, as well as effects on selected cognitive functions and self-reported reading abilities, thoughts and feelings about reading and the ability to engage in reading activities. What are the clinical implications of this work? The strategies and materials evaluated in this study could be used in clinical practice with people with aphasia. In order to replicate treatment effects in clinical practice, we suggest applying the strategy combination with the same protocol features (e.g., frequency, duration, homework, product orientation) as in this study, implementing Intervention Micro and Intervention Macro sequentially in either order. As treatment response was not equal in all individuals, it seems important to investigate individual features that contribute to treatment success. © 2023 The Authors.

"Oil- and gas-bearing rock deposits have distinct properties that significantly influence fluid distribution in pore spaces and the rock's ability to facilitate fluid flow. Rock typing involves analyzing various subsurface data to understand property relationships, enabling predictions even in data-limited areas. Central to this is understanding porosity, permeability, and saturation, which are crucial for identifying fluid types, volumes, flow rates, and estimating fluid recovery potential. These fundamental properties form the basis for informed decision-making in hydrocarbon reservoir development. While extensive descriptions with significant information exist, the data is frozen in text format and needs integration into analytical solutions like rock typing algorithms. Applying text analysis, a crucial area in natural language processing, aims to extract meaningful insights and valuable information from unstructured textual data. With the vast amount of text generated every day, automated and efficient text analysis methods are becoming increasingly essential. Machine learning techniques have revolutionized the analysis and understanding of text data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive summary of the available methods for text analysis using machine learning, covering various stages of the process, from data preprocessing to advanced text modeling approaches. The overview explores the strengths and limitations of each method, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable insights for their text analysis endeavors. A data-driven rock typing scheme is necessary for decision-making and optimization to achieve the best ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons in the most efficient way. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"People have long turned to religion as a coping strategy in times of crisis. Drawing on the analysis of talk, text, and actions, this chapter examines the deployment of spirituality and religion by Barbadian state officials and religious leaders during various moments of tensions during the span of the COVID-19 pandemic in Barbados. Specifically, the article analyzes the ways in which narratives about a God-fearing nation and religion serving the nation are reinforced and contested in varied communications. Moreover, it explores the symbolic, ideological, and material roles assigned to spirituality and religion within the society by these actors during moments of crisis. In so doing, the chapter grapples with the nuanced, and at times, ambiguous relationship between the spiritual and the secular, by focusing on the ongoing significance being attributed to spirituality and religion in a modern nation-state such as Barbados in both the storying and alimentation of the nation. Moreover, this chapter highlights the advantages of critically analyzing talk, text, and actions for making sense of how people construct and communicate meanings about unfolding events and experiences. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Corin Bailey, Roy McCree, Latoya Lazarus and Natalie Dietrich Jones; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Sentiment classification, a crucial task in natural language processing, plays a significant role in deciphering sentiment expressions within textual data. In previous work, the text preprocessing method’s impact on sentiment classification is ignored. Also, local and global context dependencies are not preserved for sentiment classification. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the impact text preprocessing techniques and introduce a novel sentiment classification framework as CNN-BiLSTM Multi-Attention Fusion Mechanism (CBMAFM) to preserve local and global context dependencies. The proposed CBMAFM uses a multi-attention fusion mechanism to leverage the synergistic power of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM). The proposed CBMAFM incorporates a multi-attention mechanism that attends to various levels of granularity within the input text. This fine-grained attention enables the model to focus on sentiment-bearing words and phrases, capturing the nuances of sentiment expression while avoiding information loss due to text length variations. By combining CNN and BiLSTM modules, CBMAFM capitalizes on the strengths of both architectures, effectively capturing local patterns and contextual dependencies, respectively. In this work, we have used benchmark datasets such as Electronics reviews, STS-Gold, Twitter reviews, and Movie reviews for experiments and accuracy improvement as 2.54%, 1.65%, 2.26%, and 2.14%, respective datasets. The results demonstrate that proposed CBMAFM performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: While there has been extensive research on understanding the effects of online reviews on product sales, there is not enough investigation of the inter-relationships between online reviews, online search and product sales. The study attempts to address this gap in the context of the Indian car market. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses text mining and considers six important review features volume, valence, length, deviation of valence, sentiment and readability within the heuristic and systematic model of information processing. Panel data regression is used along with mediation analysis to study the inter-relationships between features of reviews, online search and sales. Findings: The study finds that numerical heuristic features significantly affect sales and online search, numerical systematic feature affects sales and the textual heuristic and systematic features do not affect sales or online search in the Indian car market. Further, online search mediates the association between features of reviews and sales of cars. Research limitations/implications: Although only car sales data from India is considered in this research, similar relationships between review features, online search and sales could exist for the car market of other countries as well. Originality/value: This research uncovers the unique role of online search as a mediator between review features and sales, whereas prior literature has considered review features and online search as independent variables that affect sales. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Bipolar disorder is a heterogenous condition with a varied clinical presentation. While progress has been made in identifying genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder, most common genetic variants have not yet been identified. More detailed phenotyping (beyond diagnosis) may increase the chance of finding genetic variants. Our aim therefore was to identify clinical characteristics that index genetic differences in bipolar disorder. We performed a systematic review of all genome-wide molecular genetic, family, and twin studies investigating familial/genetic influences on the clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder. We performed an electronic database search of PubMed and PsycInfo until October 2022. We reviewed title/abstracts of 2693 unique records and full texts of 391 reports, identifying 445 relevant analyses from 142 different reports. These reports described 199 analyses from family studies, 183 analyses from molecular genetic studies and 63 analyses from other types of studies. We summarized the overall evidence per phenotype considering study quality, power, and number of studies. We found moderate to strong evidence for a positive association of age at onset, subtype (bipolar I versus bipolar II), psychotic symptoms and manic symptoms with familial/genetic risk of bipolar disorder. Sex was not associated with overall genetic risk but could indicate qualitative genetic differences. Assessment of genetically relevant clinical characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder can be used to increase the phenotypic and genetic homogeneity of the sample in future genetic studies, which may yield more power, increase specificity, and improve understanding of the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"This article presents a preliminary analysis of a corpus of texts relating to the 2022 Australian Tennis Open using a multimodal appraisal framework. The study utilises quantitative and qualitative content analysis to examine media reports, official statements, and public reactions to the incident, which centred around Novak Djokovic's vaccination status. The analysis focusses on assessing how evaluative language contributes to community-building and identifies the underlying values, beliefs, and evaluations that shape stakeholders' emotional, cognitive, and behavioural responses. The appraisal framework, encompassing attitude, engagement, and graduation, serves as a comprehensive tool for categorising resources that express evaluation. Furthermore, the article delves into the application of appraisal analysis within the context of multimodal and online discourse, encompassing various platforms such as newspapers, television, radio, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, official political statements, and court rulings. By examining these diverse media, the study seeks to investigate the dynamic discourse interplay surrounding the 2022 Australian Open, highlighting the pivotal role of evaluative communication in fostering alignment among readers through shared values and attitudes. The preliminary findings suggest that access to greater semiotic recourses increases consensus. The gains from using this interpretative framework are an asset, facilitating the coding of a large data set and attending the different manifestations of discourses around the player’s participation. As discourse continues to shape societal narratives, this multimodal appraisal investigation contributes to our understanding of the complex dynamics inherent in discourse construction and the influence of evaluative language in shaping collective perception. © 2023 Aarhus Universitet.

"Using an observational comparative case study, this study explored emergent readers’ book selection behaviors within their classrooms. Emergent literacy skills are the forefront of literacy development (Clay, 1982; Ferriero & Teborsky, 1982; Teale, 1986; McNaughton, 1993; Chall, 1996; Neuman, 2000), yet reading motivation and engagement has largely focused on older students (Wigfield & Guthrie, 1997; Gambrell et al. 2011; Marinak, 2013), and emergent readers’ motivation and book choice research has relied upon surveys (Saracho, 1986; Sperling, et al., 2013). This study of two pre-kindergarten and two kindergarten classrooms, along with their classroom teachers, utilized observations to examine emergent reader motivation and choice (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 2005; Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Clay, 1982, 1991, 2001; Rosenblatt, 1978, 1995). The observational data were analyzed for vertical and horizontal case analysis and findings suggest that emergent and early readers’ text selection behaviors rely on cover illustrations and familiarity with the text. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Considering that school literacy practices constitute social actions, through the use of language, capable of build ourselves as creative agents, the present work aims to discuss a pedagogical practice based on the reading of the novel Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996) and on the production of reading diaries, for the high school students, with a focus on critical reading about representations of social gender based on feminist Critical Discourse Studies. For this, we will describe the process of elaboration the sequence of pedagogical activities, and we will discuss the proposal of text production, built on the base of the reading of the mentioned book. For the description and discussion of this literacy practice, we use the decolonial proposal of Critical Discursive Studies (Resende 2019, Vieira, 2019) based on Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999) and Fairclough (2003), the Generified Critical Discourse Analysis (Gome, 2020), Intersectional and Decolonial Theories (Akotirene, 2019; Carvalho and Costa, 2020, Lugones, 2007) and the theoretical assumptions of critical literacy pedagogy (Kalantzis et al., 2020). As a result, we emphasize the potential of the socio-school experience to trigger reflexive and critical reading and writing processes capable of contributing to the decolonization of sociohistorically constituted representations and discourses that condition asymmetrical gender relations. © 2023 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

"Shame is an omnipresent, yet difficult to study emotion that is reluctantly experienced and often tabooed. The analysis of the selected works by German authors of Polish origin, Adam Soboczynski, Alice Bota, Alexandra Tobor and Emilia Smechowski, allows one to conclude that the socially and culturally shaped feeling of shame is presented there as an existential experience in the migration process. Against the backdrop of resettler emigration from Poland to Germany in the 1980s, the texts show moments of self-reflection by literary figures before an internalised alien observer whose system of norms and values they at least partially recognise. The literary representation of shame includes the representation of manifold causes of shame (stigmatising origin, social position, violation of norms) as well as short-and long-term effects of the experienced degradation on the migrants’ self-image and behaviour. © 2023, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu Szczecinskiego.

"Multimodal sentiment analysis leverages various modalities, including text, audio, and video, to determine human sentiment tendencies, which holds significance in fields such as intention understanding and opinion analysis. However, there are two critical challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis: one is how to effectively extract and integrate information from various modalities, which is important for reducing the heterogeneity gap among modalities; the other is how to overcome the problem of information forgetting while modelling long sequences, which leads to significant information loss and adversely affect the fusion performance of modalities. Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal heterogeneity fusion network based on graph convolutional neural networks (HFNGC). A shared convolutional aggregation mechanism is used to overcome the semantic gap among modalities and reduce the noise effect caused by modality heterogeneity. In addition, the model applies Dynamic Routing to convert modality features into graph structures. By learning semantic information in the graph representation space, our model can improve the capability of remote-dependent learning. Furthermore, the model integrates complementary information among modalities and explores the intra- and inter-modal interactions during the modality fusion stage. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods, exhibiting strong generalisation capability and high competitiveness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Leading Transformational Change: Working with Uncertainty and Navigational Principles offers an examination of how best to manage organisational change in tumultuous times. Using the metaphor of ‘navigating in uncertain waters’, the book is a unique and accessible introduction to the area of leading and managing change. Readers are equipped with tools such as practical exercises and opportunities to reflect, allowing them to assess and enact positive change. Stories and real-life examples from the sea offer lively ways to apply theory to practice. The authors examine why so often transformational change fails and how to break free of these negative patterns of behaviour. The chapters provide a deep understanding of navigational principles and step by step show how to apply this understanding to various contexts of change. Topics cover situational analysis, best managerial practice, planning, leading change, and unexpected events. Student learning is supported and reinforced with in-text reflections, discussion questions, and learning checks. © 2024 Chris Lever, Lebene Soga and Yemisi Bolade-Ogunfodun. All rights reserved."
"The paper reconstructs the semantic components of the Siberia sign by studying the travel diaries of British explorers and travelers to Siberia from the 18th to the 19th centuries. The focus is on the works of J. Bell, Ch. Cotrell, T. and L. Atkinson, H. Lansdell, W. H. Adams, and others. The analysis of English and Russian literature describing Siberian territories of that period allows the concept of “ultima Thule” (the edge of the world) to be identified that gradually got fixed to the image of Siberia. The image of Siberia is considered through its features of being wild, primitive, deaf, and, at the same time, fabulous, wonderful, heavenly, and divine. Lukomorie and Eldorado are mentioned as features highlighting the exoticism and attractiveness of Siberia by its natural wealth. The perception of the primitive and the naïve in the British texts about Siberia is compared with the perception of these notions by the Russian authors. The paper reveals the Russian words—pereferia, okraina, and glubinka—decoding the properties of “ultima Thule” in Siberia as a sign, though with the author’s respect to the natural wilderness. The identification of the signs of “own” and “foreign” in the perception of objects of geographical and ethnocultural space of Siberia is regarded as subjective and leading to cultural convergence. A conclusion is made that even in the modern period, the European reading of the Siberia sign still has a component of the exotic, and Siberia itself has been calling to be “rediscovered”. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. In this study, a smartphone application was developed to collect digital phenotyping data of users, and an ensemble method combining the results from a model pool was established through heterogeneous digital phenotyping. The aim was to predict the severity of bipolar symptoms by using two clinician-administered scales, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The collected digital phenotype data included the user's location information (GPS), self-report scales, daily mood, sleep patterns, and multimedia records (text, speech, and video). Each category of digital phenotype data was used for training models and predicting the rating scale scores (HAM-D and YMRS). Seven models were tested and compared, and different combinations of feature types were used to evaluate the performance of heterogeneous data. To address missing data, an ensemble approach was employed to increase flexibility in rating scale score prediction. This study collected heterogeneous digital phenotype data from 84 individuals with BD and 11 healthy controls. Five-fold cross-validation was employed for evaluation. The experimental results revealed that the Lasso and ElasticNet regression models were the most effective in predicting rating scale scores, and heterogeneous data performed better than homogeneous data, with a mean absolute error of 1.36 and 0.55 for HAM-D and YMRS, respectively; this margin of error meets medical requirements. © 2013 IEEE."
"Natural language processing attempts to develop and construct software that analyses, understands, and generates human languages to allow people to communicate with machines using natural languages in the future. Processing or interpreting human languages, especially written texts, necessitates linguistic level analysis and implementation, such as morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging at the word level; syntactic parsing at the sentence or structural level; finally, there is semantic analysis at the level of meaning and discourse analysis at the level of discourse or text. For example, sentence-level parsing necessitates knowledge of the individual constituent words’ morphological characteristics and grammatical categories (parts of speech). Similarly, semantic analysis involves both word-level and syntactic information. As a result, discourse-level analysis benefits from all preceding phases, such as world-level analysis, syntax, and semantics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Muskan Garg, Sandeep Kumar and Abdul Khader Jilani Saudagar chapters."
"OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews the practice implications of texts proposing an eco or green social work. While these developments reject social work’s historic emphasis on the social environment and ecological systems practice, eco practice theory has not achieved significant influence on social work practice and theory. THEORETICAL BASE: Practice objectives proposed in practice theory in textbook literature. METHODS: Analysis of trends in a textbook literature review. OUTCOMES: Although ecological sustainability concerns reflect important social issues with increasing impacts on political and social debate, they have not penetrated social work practice. This is because eco concerns are a global social issue requiring social work interaction policy constructions and fail to connect with social work agency and practitioner concerns. While these concerns overlap with critical practice theory, eco practice proposes a community grassroots practice which does not reflect local community concerns about poverty and the social environment of many social work clients. SOCIAL WORK IMPLICATIONS: The paper proposes the need for a more complex understanding linking the policy and practice implications of eco concerns, working to develop empirical evidence of the impacts of eco concerns on clients’ lives and including respect for the future of the changing natural environment in social work’s ethical and practice framework. © 2023, Czech Association of Educators in Social Work.

"Starting from a functional-cognitive approach to syntax, I propose investigating the discursive configuration of the initiator—agent or experiencer—and its possible references in passive and impersonal constructions formed with Spanish third-person reflexive se. These constructions entail the syntactic-semantic demotion and pragmatic defocusing of this participant; however, it is usual for contextual elements to build mental spaces to condition discourse viewpoint and thus guide the interpretation of the referent. I propose two basic referential dimensions, specificity and accessibility, whose combination gives rise to four categories: specific and accessible, non-specific, and accessible, specific, and inaccessible, and non-specific and inaccessible references—the analysis, based on a corpus of digital news items and comments to them submitted by readers. Qualitative observation reveals the primary resources used for configuring each referential category in the texts and their respective pragmatic repercussions. In turn, the quantitative analysis makes it possible to verify that, while accessible initiators—either specific or non-specific—are dominant in the informative discourse of news items, the great majority of referents in comments are non-specific—either accessible or inaccessible—in line with the generalization of readers’ personal experiences and opinions. I conclude that referential intentions constitute communicative style elements and are subject to sociosituational variation. © 2023 Universidad de Los Andes. All rights reserved."
"This collection of essays from a diverse group of internationally recognized scholars builds on the work of Steven J. Friesen to analyze the material and ideological dimensions of John’s Apocalypse and the religious landscape of the Roman East. Readers will gain new perspectives on the interpretation of John’s Apocalypse, the religion of Hellenistic cities in the Roman Empire, and the political and economic forces that shaped life in the Eastern Mediterranean. The chapters in this volume examine texts and material culture through carefully localized analysis that attends to ideological and socioeconomic contexts, expanding upon aspects of Friesen’s research and methodology while also forging new directions. The book brings together a diverse and international set of experts including emerging voices in the fields of biblical studies, Roman social history, and classical archeology, and each essay presents fresh, critically informed analysis of key sites and texts from the periods of Christian origins and Roman imperial rule. Revelation and Material Religion in the Roman East is of interest to students and scholars working on Christian origins, ancient Judaism, Roman religion, classical archeology, and the social history of the Roman Empire, as well as material religion in the ancient Mediterranean more broadly. It is also suitable for religious practitioners within Christian contexts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Nathan Leach, Daniel Charles Smith, and Tony Keddie."
"The oil and gas industry are facing a few challenges, including the need to attract and retain top talent, the need to manage cost escalation, and compliance to new and stricter regulations. One of the key challenges that the industry is facing is to align competencies with job requirements. This is especially true in the case of technical talents, who are essential for the safe and efficient operation of oil and gas facilities. This paper provides a comprehensive and professional account of a centralized data analytics approach designed to effectively manage the competencies of technical talents within PETRONAS Upstream's Surface operation and engineering fraternities. The study tackles the crucial challenge of aligning competencies with job requirements by utilization of data analytics and analysis to generate valuable insights into competency gaps. With a primary focus on Technical Executives, the approach extends its applicability to encompass offshore-specific talent competencies within Regional/Business Units that play a vital role in supporting field operations. The proposed approach introduces dynamic and interactive dashboards that empower heads and superiors to promptly intervene and support talent development plans. These dashboards serve as a powerful decision-making tool, facilitating the identification of specific areas necessitating further development and enabling the implementation of highly targeted training and development initiatives. The general principle used consists of the following four key elements: i. Data collection: The first phase involves collecting data on technical talents competencies, as well as the job requirements for their positions. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as job descriptions, performance appraisals, and training records. ii. Data analysis: The second phase involves analyzing the collected data to identify competency gaps. This can be done using a variety of data analytics techniques, such as statistical analysis, machine learning, and text mining; iii. Competency gap remediation: The third phase involves remediating the identified competency gaps. This can be done through a variety of interventions, such as training, mentoring, and job rotation; and iv. Evaluation: The fourth phase involves evaluating the effectiveness of the competency gap remediation interventions. This can be done by tracking the performance of technical talents over time. The successful implementation of this centralized data analytics approach has demonstrated significant improvements in talent competency management within PETRONAS Upstream's surface operation and engineering fraternities, resulting in elevated competency levels among technical talents. The implementation of the proposed centralized data analytics approach has resulted in significant improvements in talent competency management within PETRONAS Upstream. The live dashboards have enabled heads and superiors to intervene and support talent development plans, resulting in increased competency levels among technical talents. The approach has also led to more targeted training and development initiatives, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. This proposed approach can be adapted and applied to other oil and gas companies. Additionally, this approach could provide some insights for broader talent management strategies on talent competencies at the section, business unit, and regional levels. By using data analytics and algorithms to manage competencies, companies can ensure the right competencies to the right positions, ultimately resulting in improved efficiency, productivity, and safety. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Pilgrimage has its characteristics in the Holy Qur'an in general, and scholars have noted this in numerous studies. The openings and endings have their pilgrimage characteristics that have an impact on the recipient as well. They varied in different aspects derived from the texts, in the openings and closings of the surahs, united by one goal, which is to achieve convincingness for the listener on various topics. Opening and closing. In our research, we will look at some models that show the characteristics of pilgrims in the Holy Qur'an and its inferential mechanisms. This topic raises many issues, perhaps the most prominent of which are: What are the most prominent inferential mechanisms in the Holy Qur'an and what are its argumentative characteristics? Through this question and many other questions that arise strongly on this subject, we will work through the mechanisms of deconstruction and analysis to identify some of these manifestations, tracing the effects of these characteristics in some Qur'anic models. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd.

"The semantics of the Buryat noun һešxel has not been investigated in Buryat linguistics. According to the Buryat-Russian Dictionary, the lexeme under consideration has the single meaning of “conscience.” This study aimed to reveal a holistic picture of the semantics of the lexeme under study. The Electronic Corpus of the Buryat language was chosen as an invaluable source for identifying the other meanings of the lexeme. The corpus contains 2.8 million instances of word usage documented in written texts, primarily of the literary style, accompanied by their meta-descriptions. The word hešxel was formed by the phonetic method of word formation from the word sed’xel “thoughts, intention, soul, heart.” The alternation of root consonants s//һ, d’//š can be traced. The analysis of the Electronic Corpus identified the original meaning of hešxel “soul” later extended to “sympathy, affection,” “sincerity, responsiveness,” “intimate connection” and “wish.” The meaning of “conscience” is believed to have originated from the concepts of “sincerity and responsiveness.” For example, the adverb hešxelgüi could be translated both “half-hearted, indifferent” and “unscrupulous, shameless.” Additionally, the meaning “conscience” is assumed to have appeared influenced by the Russian language, given the absence of a special word for “conscience” in the Khalkha-Mongolian language. Buryat language, at a certain point, probably needed a word to regulate human behavior in society to define moral guidelines. A further study of the Mongolic-language vocabulary characterizing human emotional states may expand the semantic structure of words and uncover the peculiarities of the value system of the Mongolic peoples. © 2023, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Nowadays, large amounts of unstructured data are available online. Such data often contain users’ emotions and feelings about a variety of topics but their retrieval and selection on the basis of an emotional perspective are usually unfeasible through traditional search engines, which only rank web content according to its relevance with respect to a given search keyword. For this reason, in the present work we introduce the architecture of a novel emotion-aware search engine that can return search results ranked on the basis of seven human emotions. Using this system, users can benefit from a more advanced semantic search that also takes into account emotions. The system uses emotion recognition algorithms based on deep learning to extract emotion vectors from texts, images and videos and then populates an emotional index to allow users to visualise results related to given emotions. We also discuss and evaluate different deep learning models for building emotional indexes from texts, images and videos. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"The paper examines a significant aspect of the gender problem in Russian literature during the 1920s and 1930s. Specifically, it explores the motivational situation behind the masculiniza-Tion of female characters in response to the post-revolutionary push for gender equality, both ideologically and aesthetically. The wide prevalence of the image of ""a woman with a gun"" is considered, with attention also paid to the poetic and semantic variants, such as ""atamansha"" and ""commissarsha."" The analysis covers the following works: ""Barsuki"" (""The Badgers"") by L. Leonov, ""Gadyuka"" (""The Viper"") by A. Tolstoy, ""Sorok pervyy"" (""The Forty-first"") by B. Lavrenev, and ""Bab ya pechal (""Women s Sadness"") ""by I. Goldberg. The choice of material determines the focus of research attention on poetic and stylistic shifts in the struc-Ture of the artistic text of Soviet literature of the years under study. The conflict between so-cial and natural principles, manifested in the deformation of women s nature in the conditions of the shifted time, is of particular relevance in the works of the authors in question. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"The field of text mining has increasingly relied on Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for its ability to perform high-dimensional data reduction and visualization. This paper aims to employ NMF in analyzing a dataset of 1,500 documents and 12,419 words in bags-of-words format, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of NMF in effectively classifying ambiguous and sparse textual data into distinct topics and extracting meaningful contents through the identification of relevant keywords. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of NMF in topic clustering by exploring the semantic relationship between extracted keywords and the topics to which they belonged. Our findings offered valuable insights into the application of NMF in text mining and suggested that universities in Vietnam could leverage this technique to analyze feedback and suggestions from students. © 2023, © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."
"This chapter challenges the assumption that altars in the Ancient Mediterranean were mainly associated with monumental temples. Using the Hellenistic city of Priene as a case study, the chapter shows that the majority of ancient altars were untempled. By analyzing the location, function, and discursive context of in-situ altars in Priene, the study explores how these ritual objects operated within the urban landscape and shaped the sacred spaces of non-temple buildings. Drawing on historical texts and architectural evidence, the paper argues that altars played a crucial role in defining sacred spaces within Hellenistic public buildings, revealing the fluidity between so-called religious and civic spaces. The study questions the traditional temple-centered approach to ancient religions and highlights the importance of altars as central ritual foci. The category of untempled altars is a valuable yet overlooked source of data that revises our understanding of sacred space in the ancient world. Overall, this study offers a new perspective on the relationship between altars and the urban landscape, inviting scholars to reconsider their interpretations and analyses of religious architecture in antiquity. © 2023 Taylor and Francis."
"Background: Pokémon GO, an augmented reality game with widespread popularity, can potentially influence players’ physical activity (PA) levels and psychosocial well-being. Objective: This review aims to systematically examine the scientific evidence regarding the impact of Pokémon GO on PA and psychosocial well-being in children and adolescents. Methods: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework, we conducted keyword and reference searches in the PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, evidence synthesis, and identified research gaps. Results: Our review included 10 studies that explored the effect of Pokémon GO on PA or psychosocial well-being among children and adolescents. These studies used diverse designs across multiple countries and regions. Pokémon GO use measures encompassed frequency, experience, adherence, and motivation. PA assessment methods ranged from self-reported questionnaires to technology-based evaluations and qualitative approaches. Psychosocial well-being measures included emotional intelligence, personal well-being, self-control, emotionality, and sociability. In general, the estimated impact of Pokémon GO on PA was positive, with gaming elements and engagement correlating with increased PA levels. However, the effect on psychosocial well-being presented mixed results, with positive associations for sociability but a complex relationship involving well-being and internet gaming disorder. The limitations of these studies comprised the absence of randomized controlled trials, heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, and potential confounding bias. Conclusions: Overall, Pokémon GO tends to positively affect PA levels, while the impact on psychosocial well-being remains complex and requires further investigation. Future research should investigate the mechanisms connecting Pokémon GO use with PA and psychosocial well-being and the potential risks of excessive gameplay. These findings can help inform public health interventions to harness gaming technologies for promoting PA and enhancing well-being among the younger generation. © Haiyan Liang, Xi Wang, Ruopeng An.

"A network text analysis is a way to extract knowledge from texts and generate a network of words. A central premise is that the network represents the mental model of the author. After transforming an unstructured text into a structured network, text analytic methods can be used to analyze the network conducted by specific networks. Moreover, this kind of information representation can be one technique to achieve the underlying semantic structure of a text and make the mental models of different authors comparable. In evolving knowledge resources such as wiki articles, the extracted networks can be utilized to compare the uncovering of misconceptions, knowledge conflicts between authors, or the identification of latent relations between concepts in a particular knowledge domain. A network text analysis and visualization are used for the concept network. There are three main steps in the process – concept identification, relationship identification, and network generation. Various techniques are available for each of these steps. Identified concepts for extracting concepts and relations are based on an open information extraction tool (ClausIE). Three steps are supported to extract labeled relations between concepts: extraction of candidate relations and a-posteriori filtering by the user. The solution, which can be easily incorporated into existing process chains for network extraction from texts, is compatible with arbitrary approaches for concept extraction. In this chapter, we review the existing research articles on concept networks and network text analysis to find some research gaps and discuss the methods of applying concept networks and network text analysis. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Muskan Garg, Sandeep Kumar and Abdul Khader Jilani Saudagar chapters."
"Objectives/Scope: This work aims to develop a systematic methodology for the optimisation of maintenance inventory management, independent of industry or project lifecycle stages (greenfield and brownfield). The objective is to enable operators to integrate the use of 'lite' dynamic optimisation and recommender systems into existing or proposed business processes, systems, and ways of working. Additionally, this work aims to explore methodologies for enabling the sustainment and ongoing improvement of such systems within a complex asset management context. Methods, Procedures, Process: Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to improve the speed and accuracy of identifying and cataloguing interchangeable materials and classifying failure modes from operational maintenance data. These algorithms enable comparative analytics across and within facilities, including reliability modelling, material demand modelling, and production vs maintenance optimisation models. This approach leverages foundational maintenance build analyses outputs such as FMECA, RCM, and cataloguing. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Results highlight the ability of these 'lite' dynamic optimisation and recommender models to be deployed at speed and to be sustained, whilst enabling significant value gains, across production uptime, maintenance cost, and safety, at low cost (particularly when compared to large software systems). Such systems are also designed to be user and use case centric, enabling them to be dynamic and easy to configure. A recent implementation of our data-driven approach has led to 40% reduction in inventory value while increasing the critical spare materials to enable high asset availability. Novel/Additive Information: Advanced text processing algorithms used in conjunction with advanced maintenance and reliability modelling techniques, packaged within 'lite' systems. These systems are also live and provide recommendations at a frequency suitable to the operator's business process requirements. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Textbooks constitute important learning tools in foreign language education and should depict ethnic and gender diversity (UNESCO, 2017). This paper responds to calls for intersectional textbook research and addresses the following question: How diverse are representations of wo/men of colour and white wo/men in Dutch language and culture textbooks? We performed content analysis of six frequently used textbooks for learning Dutch, examining pictures, texts and (audio-recorded) dialogues. Results show an underrepresentation of people of colour (PoC) in comparison to demographic statistics. PoC are featured in a limited range of low-status roles, countries and cities are Euro- and Netherlands centric, and there is little variety in terms of accented speech in dialogues. In addition, non-native speakers utter sentences that frame them as dependent. An exception to these tendencies is the textbook Contact 1 (2019), which presents alternative, more inclusive ‘realities’. Our paper builds on the body of (Anglocentric) textbook research from a cultural studies’ perspective, helps determine the degree to which educational materials meet diversity demands in language education policies, and discusses what alternative ‘realities’ could arise in Dutch textbooks. © 2023 Didactic Asociation Andalucia.

"Statement of problem: The union of the metal removable partial denture framework to the heat polymerized acrylic resin is related to prosthesis longevity. However, methods to enhance this bond are not clear to clinicians and dental laboratory technicians. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify which metal surface treatments best increase the bond strength between heat polymerized acrylic resin and removable partial denture alloys. Material and methods: This review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42022384926). Electronic searches were carried out independently, by 3 examiners in Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and in the nonpeer-reviewed literature via ProQuest. Results: The electronic searches resulted in 4143 articles, with 4055 after removing duplicates. After reading the titles and abstracts, 37 articles were selected for reading in full-text version, from which 6 articles were included. All studies evaluated materials for conventional acrylic resin denture base (heat polymerized), processed by water bath, bonded to metal. For the metal framework alloys, cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) alloys were used in 2 studies, titanium (Ti) in 2 studies, and Co-Cr and Ti in the other 2 studies. Different metal surface treatments were used as airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide (particle sizes of 50 µm, 110 µm, and 250 µm) followed by the primer application and the isolated use of the primer, compared to the absence of isolated intervention or airborne-particle abrasion of the metal surface. Among the different primers used, those based on 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP) showed the highest acrylic resin-to-metal bond strength values. Conclusions: Airborne-particle abrading the metal with Al2O3 followed by applying a 10-MDP-based primer, increased the bond strength between metal framework alloys and heat polymerized acrylic resin denture base material. © 2023 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry"
"Most of the time, cybercriminals look for new ways to bypass security controls by improving their attacks. In the 1980s, attackers developed malware to kidnap user data by requesting payments. Malware is called a ransomware. Recently, they have demanded payment in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Ransomware is one of the most dangerous threats on the Internet, and this type of malware could affect almost all devices. Malware cipher device data, making them inaccessible to users. In this study, a new method for Android ransomware classification was proposed. This method implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for malware classification based on images. This paper presents a novel method for transforming an Android Application Package (APK) into a grayscale image. The image creation relies on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning and Fuzzy Hashing to represent the decompiled code from the APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing using NLP techniques. The image is composed of n fuzzy hashes that represent the APK. The method was tested using a dataset of 7,765 Android ransomware samples obtained from external researchers and public sources. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of other methods in the literature. © 2013 IEEE."
"Background: Given the threat posed by cancer to human health, there is a rapid growth in the volume of data in the cancer field and interdisciplinary and collaborative research is becoming increasingly important for fine-grained classification. The low-resolution classifier of reported studies at the journal level fails to satisfy advanced searching demands, and a single label does not adequately characterize the literature originated from interdisciplinary research results. There is thus a need to establish a multilabel classifier with higher resolution to support literature retrieval for cancer research and reduce the burden of screening papers for clinical relevance. Objective: The primary objective of this research was to address the low-resolution issue of cancer literature classification due to the ambiguity of the existing journal-level classifier in order to support gaining high-relevance evidence for clinical consideration and all-sided results for literature retrieval. Methods: We trained a multilabel classifier with scalability for classifying the literature on cancer research directly at the publication level to assign proper content-derived labels based on the “Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) + X” model and obtain the best option for X. First, a corpus of 70,599 cancer publications retrieved from the Dimensions database was divided into a training and a testing set in a ratio of 7:3. Second, using the classification terminology of International Cancer Research Partnership cancer types, we compared the performance of classifiers developed using BERT and 5 classical deep learning models, such as the text recurrent neural network (TextRNN) and FastText, followed by metrics analysis. Results: After comparing various combined deep learning models, we obtained a classifier based on the optimal combination “BERT + TextRNN,” with a precision of 93.09%, a recall of 87.75%, and an F1-score of 90.34%. Moreover, we quantified the distinctive characteristics in the text structure and multilabel distribution in order to generalize the model to other fields with similar characteristics. Conclusions: The “BERT + TextRNN” model was trained for high-resolution classification of cancer literature at the publication level to support accurate retrieval and academic statistics. The model automatically assigns 1 or more labels to each cancer paper, as required. Quantitative comparison verified that the “BERT + TextRNN” model is the best fit for multilabel classification of cancer literature compared to other models. More data from diverse fields will be collected to testify the scalability and extensibility of the proposed model in the future. ©Ying Zhang, Xiaoying Li, Yi Liu, Aihua Li, Xuemei Yang, Xiaoli Tang."
"Aims: To explore and summarise the literature on the concept of ‘clinical deterioration’ as a nurse-sensitive indicator of quality of care in the out-of-hospital context. Design: The scoping review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review and the JBI best practice guidelines for scoping reviews. Methods: Studies focusing on clinical deterioration, errors of omission, nurse sensitive indicators and the quality of nursing and midwifery care for all categories of registered, enrolled, or licensed practice nurses and midwives in the out-of-hospital context were included regardless of methodology. Text and opinion papers were also considered. Study protocols were excluded. Data Sources: Data bases were searched from inception to June 2022 and included CINAHL, PsychINFO, MEDLINE, The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EmCare, Maternity and Infant Care Database, Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Informit Health and Society Database, JSTOR, Nursing and Allied Health Database, RURAL, Cochrane Library and Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: Thirty-four studies were included. Workloads, education and training opportunities, access to technology, home visits, clinical assessments and use of screening tools or guidelines impacted the ability to recognise, relay information and respond to clinical deterioration in the out-of-hospital setting. Conclusions: Little is known about the work of nurses or midwives in out-of-hospital settings and their recognition, reaction to and relay of information about patient deterioration. The complex and subtle nature of non-acute deterioration creates challenges in defining and subsequently evaluating the role and impact of nurses in these settings. Implications for the profession and/or patient care: Further research is needed to clarify outcome measures and nurse contribution to the care of the deteriorating patient in the out-of-hospital setting to reduce the rate of avoidable hospitalisation and articulate the contribution of nurses and midwives to patient care. Impact: What Problem Did the Study Address? Factors that impact a nurse's ability to recognise, relay information and respond to clinical deterioration in the out-of-hospital setting are not examined to date. What Were the Main Findings? A range of factors were identified that impacted a nurse's ability to recognise, relay information and respond to clinical deterioration in the out-of-hospital setting including workloads, education and training opportunities, access to technology, home visits, clinical assessments, use of screening tools or guidelines, and avoidable hospitalisation.Where and on whom will the research have an impact?Nurses and nursing management will benefit from understanding the factors that act as barriers and facilitators for effective recognition of, and responding to, a deteriorating patient in the out-of-hospital setting. This in turn will impact patient survival and satisfaction.

"Critical stylistics investigates ideologies, ideas, and views in literary and texts, whether visible or hidden. It seeks to describe the linguistic choices made by speakers or authors in terms of their ideational viewpoints, thoughts, and meaning. In this regard, the purpose of this research is to conduct a critical stylistic analysis of interior monologues from Ahlam Mosteghanemi's novel (Chaos of the senses). Interior monologues are monologues or speeches delivered on stage by a single character conveying his or her thoughts and feelings. Ideology is expected to be present in all forms of language. Ahlam Mosteghanemi's language is thus assumed to have some of these ideologies inside its structure; but, what type of ideology may be discovered in Ahlam Mosteghanemi's interior monologue? Through the textual-conceptual functions suggested by Jeffries (2010), Critical Stylistics investigates what the text is doing. It is firstly hypothesized that: There is a typical interior monologue in depicting the characters. Secondly, there is an ideology or ideologies behind the analyzed literary texts like novels. The study concludes that Ahlam Mosteghanemi's language reflects a considerable deal of ideology, both hidden and obvious. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This book anchors shared reading as an essential element within a comprehensive and balanced literacy program. Margaret Mooney In this book, Brenda Parkes introduces new teachers to shared reading and helps experienced teachers revitalize this important teaching practice. Starting with the bedtime story, Read It Again! outlines the essential elements and benefits of shared reading and provides detailed examples which show how a shared reading session unfolds in the classroom. By including examples of implicit and explicit teaching, Brenda demonstrates how shared reading helps children develop a range of strategies for reading and comprehending text. You will find detailed strategies that support learners in developing self-extending systems through their understanding of content and process and several examples of independent activities that consolidate and extend learning. Good book selection is the key to successful shared reading experiences. In discussing the criteria for quality book selection, Brenda shows us how to critically assess the teaching and learning possibilities in shared reading books and how to use a variety of text types to model purpose, content, and form. The book includes an analysis of supportive text features for the different needs of emergent, early, and fluent readers. Annotated bibliographies provide a quick reference to quality books.

"The tourism industry plays a significant role in the economy of Bangladesh, particularly in the world-renowned coastal town of Cox’s Bazar. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted this sector, leading to substantial economic losses and shifts in customer satisfaction and behavior. This study aims to analyze the change in customer satisfaction in Cox’s Bazar hotels and resorts before and after the pandemic. In order to identify user-generated content from 9481 reviews from 11 hotels, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC-22) software was used for text analysis, followed by factor analysis and regression analysis. The study highlights the increased importance of “Financial Stability” post-pandemic, likely due to price reductions and special offers. Additionally, “Digital Culture” and “Illness” emerged as new dissatisfaction factors. The insights offer valuable implications for businesses, policymakers, and tourism stakeholders to strategize effective customer service and foster sustainable recovery in the post-pandemic era. © 2023 by author(s)."
"The smoke produced by wildfires can travel great distances and lead to respiratory and/or cardiovascular health impacts through inhalation. Individuals can reduce exposure by implementing smoke mitigation measures in their homes and beyond. In this article, we examine household level survey data (n = 543) on wildfire smoke mitigation in response to the September 2020 wildfires that occurred in the state of Oregon (and beyond). The air quality was hazardous for about 10 days in many affected regions. This study assessed the implementation of six commonly referenced approaches to reducing exposure to smoke: staying indoors; keeping doors and windows closed, turning on HVAC; using air purifiers; replacing air filters, and wearing face masks. We found high levels of implementation of staying indoors and keeping doors and windows closed; however, statistical analysis of socioeconomic demographics suggests that respondents vary in the implementation of the other measures. Income, number of exposure days, and access to information on smoke mitigation were positively associated with the implementation. Given the importance of information access for implementation for three of the measures, we also present data on how different age groups prefer to be contacted about air quality and smoke mitigation. For example, participants above 65 years of age prefer local TV as opposed to social media, whereas text messages were favored by all age groups. These survey results will help to inform the design of campaigns to engage community members differentially and potentially affect best communication practices and other assistance/preparation for smoke mitigation across demographics. © 2023 Society for Risk Analysis."
"The guilt doors of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Theotokos in Suzdal is a landmark of Medieval Rus artistic craftwork. The western doors of the cathedral are compared with the Novgorod doors of 1336 created for the St. Sophia Cathedral in Velikiy Novgorod. The stylistics of the latter demonstrate decline in the traditions of artistic craftwork and lower requirements of the societal elite to its production. Such transformation was the result of the Mongol invasion and the Horde yoke. Main narrative scenes on the cathedral doors of the 16th century are different from the scenes on the Suzdal doors; in some cases, their narratives coincide. The interpretation of the religious scenes on the doors of the 13th and the 16th centuries demonstrates cardinal differences. The artisans of the 16th century pay more attention to details, introduce additions that are not based on the text of the Bible and were borrowed from secondary Christian interpretations in theological books, prayer practice and hymnography. The comparative analysis offers an opportunity to address the issues relating to the role of the Suzdal doors in subsequent development of Medieval Rus craftwork, the impact on later works of art, evolution of the style and iconography. © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology.

"Objective: To determine the effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on lower limb function, walking, and quality of life in patients with lower limb poststroke spasticity. Data Sources: A comprehensive and systematic electronic database search of PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest thesis Dissertation checks, Google Scholar was conducted from January 2010 to March 2022. Review Method: Initially, the bibliography was screened to identify randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of ESWT on lower limb spasticity and functional outcomes in stroke patients. Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract, full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the selected studies. The primary evaluation outcome was spasticity assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and the secondary outcomes were walking performance and quality of life measured on different scales. Data Synthesis: Out of the total of 483 records, 15 studies (389 participants) were finally found eligible for inclusion. A meta-analysis was performed and beneficial effects of ESWT were observed in the experimental group compared with the control group on spasticity. MAS: Standard mean difference (SMD = 0.626), (95%CI = −0.133, 1.119), (p < 0.01), ROM: (SMD = 0.573), (95%CI = 0.074, 1.072), (p < 0.02). The result for before and after ESWT application on TUG: (SMD = 0.174), (95%CI=-0.151, 0.499), (p = 0.29). The results for walking performance were not significant and inconclusive which may be due to the heterogeneity of the studies included. Conclusion: Evidence suggests that ESWT has promising effects in reducing spasticity and improving lower limb motor function. However, uncertainty exists regarding its effectiveness in walking performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

"This article critically evaluates Sri Lankan Canadian writer Shyam Selvadurai’s historical novel Cinnamon Gardens (1998), set in 1927–1928 Ceylon during the Donoughmore Commission’s inquiry into possible self-rule for Ceylon. One of Selvadurai’s lesser-known works, Cinnamon Gardens actively mimics the tone and content of high realist British texts of the nineteenth century as it depicts the lives of the upper-class Tamil bourgeoisie of Colombo. Focusing on the novel’s aesthetic form and portrayal of Ceylon / Sri Lanka, this article investigates Selvadurai’s use of postcolonial historical fiction to articulate questions of history and spatial imagination. My analysis of the dimensions of historical fiction as a genre reveals how Selvadurai’s self-conscious recasting of British realism emerges as a narrative technique that demonstrates a model of derivative realism and its variegated textures when articulated from the peripheral perspective. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Many Buddhist teachers in North America teach forgiveness: an attitude of non-anger not conditional on wrongdoers repairing their wrongs. Classical Buddhist texts and premodern Buddhist cultures also taught forgiveness: the act of reconciling after wrongdoers repaired wrongs. This article describes traditional Buddhist forgiveness processes, analyses how new processes to forgive arose in North America, and outlines the current state of Buddhist forgiveness teachings there. It shows that the predominant way North American Buddhists now teach forgiveness is new. It developed in the 1970–1990 period and incorporates non-Buddhist discourses. In addition to clarifying what forgiveness has long been in Buddhism and how, in North America, changes to that occurred, the article notes the frequent absence, among academic scholars and Buddhists alike, of awareness concerning (a) the replacement of longstanding Buddhist teachings on forgiveness by new teachings; (b) the predominantly non-Buddhist sources of the new teachings; and (c) the impact on victims, wrongdoers, relationships, and communities of the new teachings. The article contributes to scholarship on Buddhist ethics, forgiveness in Buddhism, and the development and hybridisation of Buddhism in North America. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

"Judges frequently rely their reasoning on precedents. Courts must preserve uniformity in decisions while, depending on the legal system, previous cases compel rulings. The search for methods to accurately identify similar previous cases is not new and has been a vital input, for example, to case-based reasoning (CBR) methodologies. This literature review offers a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in automating the identification of legal precedents, primarily focusing on the paradigm shift from manual knowledge engineering to the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). While multiple approaches harnessing NLP and ML show promise, none has emerged as definitively superior, and further validation through statistically significant samples and expert-provided ground truth is imperative. Additionally, this review employs text-mining techniques to streamline the survey process, providing an accurate and holistic view of the current research landscape. By delineating extant research gaps and suggesting avenues for future exploration, this review serves as both a summation and a call for more targeted, empirical investigations. © 2023 Hugo Mentzingen et al."
"In recent years, with the increasing number of computers in the world, the construction and application of computer networks have also developed rapidly. However, with the rapid and convenient transmission of information, the information security problem is becoming more and more serious. Support vector machine (SVM) is a new generation of data mining method developed on the basis of statistical learning theory, which has been well applied in the fields of character recognition, handwriting recognition, image classification, bioinformatics and so on. Compared with traditional methods such as neural network, it has many advantages, such as strong generalization ability, insensitive dimension, convergence to the global optimum, etc., and solves the problems of over-learning, dimension disaster, local extremum, etc. It has become a very active research direction in the field of data mining in recent years. Now support vector machine is widely used in automatic text classification, handwritten digit recognition, biological information and other fields. Identity authentication and access control technology, encryption / decryption technology, firewall technology and other security technologies emerge one after another. As the core technology of information security, cryptography has attracted more and more attention. Data encryption technology effectively protects the security of network data by encrypting the effective information into meaningless random code according to certain rules. © 2023 IEEE."
"The article proposes a re-examination of the role and position of the so-called ""Disney villains""within the narrative framework of animated films and popular culture as a whole. In the first part, the historical evolution in the representation of these villains will be explored according to the practice of ""queer coding,""which involves attributing stereotypically queer traits to them without explicitly stating their gender and sexual identity. It will be observed how their non-conforming gender and sexuality, used to mark their moral deviance, challenge and defy dominant gender and narrative norms. It is precisely through their queer performance and camp aesthetic that ""evil stepmothers,""""sissy-villains,""and ""drag-queen-like""sea witches can emancipate themselves from their traditional roles as antagonists (narrative level) and as social outcasts (discursive level) to seize the spotlight through the screen (manifest surface). This study combines tools of Greimasian text analysis, including the canonical narrative schema and the generative trajectory of meaning, with Lotman's theory and notion of ""semiosphere,""to investigate the centrality and criticality of these ""quillains""within the heteronormative narrative framework and the broader cultural context. To capture (or being captured by) the queer aspect of these characters and their stories, the invitation is to look at their visage not as a coded symbol of an underlying identity and truth, but as an image that exceeds any defined meaning thanks to its iconic power.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2023."
"The generation of test cases to verify and validate the actions of software or an application, as per the customers’ requirements, is an indispensable activity in software industries. A tester could construct test cases to suffice various objectives, which could be random or task-oriented at times. Most of the time, test cases are generated based on clients’ specifications or requirements. These requirements are structured in natural language, and manual derivation of test cases from such client-stated requirements could be a cumbersome and time-absorbing activity for testers. Until recently, many practitioners have proposed a natural language processing (NLP)-oriented solution to automate or semi-automate the manual process of generating test cases from requirements; nevertheless, such studies imposed a restriction on how the clients should document or represent their requirements. This study, on the contrary, suggested an NLP solution that considers free-format user requirements and applies text pre-processing, a combination of dependency parser and RAKE process, along with a statistical similarity measure and template-based natural language generation (NLG) to translate them into detailed test cases. Apart from test case generation, with the aid of NLP tactics, this study has also proposed a solution for encoding the historical data of test cases into numerical values. Such numerical scores serve as valuable data and create the proper insight for testers during test case optimization. © 2023 The Author(s).

"As can be witnessed in projects such as The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction (Prucher, Jeff. 2007. Brave new words: The Oxford dictionary of science fiction. Oxford: Oxford University Press), science fiction has been fertile ground for the creation of new words and concepts. Whereas the aforementioned dictionary was constructed by eliciting examples and citations from volunteers, this paper presents an initial foray into data-driven methods for uncovering lexis unique to science fiction. Words unique to science fiction texts are extracted by comparing a science fiction corpus against the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium. 2007. The British National Corpus, XML edition. Oxford Text Archive. http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12024/2554 (accessed 29 June 2022)) to produce a list of 306 neologisms from 74 texts. In addition, this study seeks to examine the ways in which authors impart the meaning of such words to the reader, drawing on frameworks of semantic word relations and work in cognitive linguistics. This reveals the use of definitions and glosses by the authors, both in narration and direct speech, co-occurrence with synonyms, and the drip-feeding of attributes pertaining to the concept being referenced. In addition, characters can be shown to struggle with the concepts to which neologisms refer, allowing authors to explore themes of alienation and other-worldliness. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2023."
"With the continuous development of information technology, more and more scholars use machine learning and integrated learning algorithms to analyze and predict the text emotion of online text reviews, explore the emotional tendencies of online users, which has far-reaching theoretical guiding significance and practical value for the promotion of online book sales decisions in the later stage. In this paper, user emotion is mined and analyzed based on online book reviews. The user emotion tendency is obtained through the emotion analysis method, which can help the e-commerce understand the user preferences and the quality of books on time, recommend books according to the user preferences, and play an auxiliary role in decision-making for consumers to purchase. Because of the current single method model and the inability to compare the accuracy of emotional prediction, this paper uses the public dataset Book_review on the official website of Kaggle, using NLTK (Nature Language TooKit), a natural language processing tool, to clean text data, build machine learning models and integrated learning models based on n-gram text features, obtain the results of emotional prediction through experimental analysis, and compare the machine learning model with the integrated learning model method, selecting the Logistic Regression model with the highest accuracy for emotional analysis of online book reviews, identify users’ emotional tendencies. Finally, we found that the accuracy of online comment emotion prediction based on the n-gram text feature Logistic Regression model is about 5% higher than the existing research methods. © 2023 SPIE."
"This contribution investigates gains in technical economy in measuring language ability by considering one recurrent interest of JD Brown: cloze tests. In the various versions of the Test of Academic Literacy Levels (TALL), its Sesotho and Afrikaans (Toets van Akademiese Geletterdheidsvlakke - TAG) counterparts, as well as related other tests used in South Africa, the test designers have used a modification of this procedure to very good effect. This paper reports on the steady evolution of its format over many years, how it is currently used, what its outstanding empirical properties are, and how the kind of technical economy it brings to the measurement of the ability to handle the demands of academic language at the level of tertiary education can be further applied. The modification involves the conventional, more or less systematic mutilation of a selected text, with two multiple choice questions about every gap in it: where the gap is, and which word has been omitted. We have not seen anywhere else analyses of this format, which in itself may be of interest to test designers. We proceed by defining technical economy, and then develop an argument on the basis of the empirical properties of TALL on how that idea can be applied, in particular to the design and task selection of such tests, before giving illustrations of how such choices may contribute to further and other productive and responsible designs and test formats. © 2023 European Knowledge Development (EUROKD).

"Objectives: Given the increasing trend of care transition from healthcare settings to patients’ own home, patients and their family caregivers should take more responsibilities for care at own home. This study is going to investigate the effect of a transitional care program from hospital to own home using a digital messaging application on patients’ undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and their family caregivers’ health outcomes. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial study will be conducted in a hospital in a metropolis located in southwestern Iran. Sampling will be performed sequentially and the eligible dyad of patients and family caregivers will be randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group will receive a transitional care program for 8 weeks using the WhatsApp on the mobile phone based on the person-centered care approach, but the control group will receive routine care for patient’s transition. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and two months after the intervention using demographic questionnaire, Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES), MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire (MNHD-Q), Cardiac Symptom Scale (CSS), Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS). Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used for data analysis. Conclusions: The results of this study will allow evaluating the effectiveness of an innovative transitional care program to patients’ own home using a digital messaging application. If the transitional program is shown feasible and effective it can be incorporated into existing care programs and stimulate further studies on the use of digital solutions for improving the continuity of care in own home. 2023 Maleki, Mardani, Iloonkashkooli, Khachian, Glarcher and Vaismoradi."
"The article sketches an overview of the impersonation of Black and Sámi Others in Finnish cinema and visual culture. How and why have Finnish cultural producers used blackface performance or ‘fake’ Sámi garments in their films? By connecting several historically and aesthetically disparate texts, the article makes evident an underpinning structure of racial Othering. The structure is obscured, however, by commentators who argue such Other performance is innocent and not intended to ridicule or harm. This defence maintains that it is White Finns’s power to define what counts as racism. By combining analysis of disparate examples of racial impersonation in cinema and cultural texts with critiques and defences of it, the article traces how structural racism is maintained. Study of cinema history contributes to understanding the history of structural racism. © 2023 Intellect Ltd Feature Article. English language."
"In the 19th century, numerous imperial poems written by Emperor Qianlong were translated into English. One of these poems was an ode to the Chicken Cup, which is a famous product of official kiln porcelain in the Ming and Qing dynasties. This paper presents a study of two 19th century English translations of this ode, that is, Stephen Weston’s 1809 translation Ly Tang, An Imperial Poem in Chinese, and Stephen Wootton Bushell’s 1986 translation in Oriental Ceramic Art, Collection of W. T. Walters. The present study combines textual analysis with insight into the translational context to explore this 19th-century cultural encounter between China and the West in which the Western interest in and knowledge of Chinese culture evolved from misreading to discovery. This case study also provides an overview of the transition in knowledge from “pre-travelogue Sinology” to “professional Sinology” in the early years of Sino-British cultural interactions. © 2023, National Academy for Educational Research.

"Introduction: Young adulthood is a transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. Due to the unique pressures of taking on a new social role and associated uncertainties, young adults are at heightened risk for drug and alcohol use. Furthermore, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increases the likelihood of using maladaptive coping strategies such as using substances to avoid or soothe negative emotions. The current review aimed to summarize the associations between exposure to ACEs before the age of 18 years and subsequent drug or alcohol use between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Methods: The review was performed in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases was conducted in February 2022. Results: The initial search yielded 7178 articles, with 777 duplicates. Consequently, 6401 titles were inspected for relevance. After reading the full text, 88 articles were included in the review. Conclusion: This review provides clear evidence that exposure to multiple ACEs is a robust risk factor for the use of alcohol, cannabis and other drugs by young adults. Poor self-regulation and maladaptive coping strategies were identified as mechanisms explaining this link; however, further detailed research is needed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Background: To effectively combat the rising incidence of syphilis, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) created a National Rapid Response to Syphilis with actions aimed at bolstering epidemiological surveillance of acquired, congenital syphilis, and syphilis during pregnancy complemented with communication activities to raise population awareness and to increase uptake of testing that targeted mass media outlets from November 2018 to March 2019 throughout Brazil, and mainly areas with high rates of syphilis. This study analyzes the volume and quality of online news content on syphilis in Brazil between 2015 and 2019 and examines its effect on testing. Methods: The collection and processing of online news were automated by means of a proprietary digital health ecosystem established for the study. We applied text data mining techniques to online news to extract patterns from categories of text. The presence and combination of such categories in collected texts determined the quality of news that were analyzed to classify them as high-, medium-and low-quality news. We examined the correlation between the quality of news and the volume of syphilis testing using Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient. Results: 1,049 web pages were collected using a Google Search API, of which 630 were categorized as earned media. We observed a steady increase in the number of news on syphilis in 2015 (n = 18), 2016 (n = 26), and 2017 (n = 42), with a substantial rise in the number of news in 2018 (n = 107) and 2019 (n = 437), although the relative proportion of high-quality news remained consistently high (77.6 and 70.5% respectively) and in line with similar years. We found a correlation between news quality and syphilis testing performed in primary health care with an increase of 82.32, 78.13, and 73.20%, respectively, in the three types of treponemal tests used to confirm an infection. Conclusion: Effective communication strategies that lead to dissemination of high quality of information are important to increase uptake of public health policy actions.

"Introduction: Despite increasing attention to improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic medicine, a theoretically informed perspective to advancing equity is often missing. Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that refers to the study of the dynamic nature of social categories with which an individual identifies and their unique localization within power structures. Intersectionality can be a useful lens to understand and address inequity, however, there is limited literature on intersectionality in the context of medical education. Thus, we explored how intersectionality has been conceptualized and applied in medical education. Methods: We employed a meta-narrative review, analyzing existing literature on intersectionality theory and frameworks in medical education. Three electronic databases were searched using key terms yielding 32 articles. After, title, abstract and full-text screening 14articles were included. Analysis of articles sought a meaningful synthesis on application of intersectionality theory to medical education. Results: Existing literature on intersectionality discussesthe role of identity categorization and the relationship between identity, power, and social change. There are contrasting narratives on the practical application of intersectionality to medical education, producing tensions between how intersectionality is understood as theory and how it is translated in practice. Discussion: A paucity in literature on intersectionality in medical education suggests that there is a risk intersectionality may be understood in a superficial manner and considered a synonym for diversity. Drawing explicit attention to its core tenets of reflexivity, transformational identity, and analysis of power is important to maintain fidelity to how intersectionality is understood in broader critical social science literature. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"This article empirically studies the Catalan Digital Republic, that is the set of practises, narratives, institutions, and infrastructures mobilised by a stateless nation to reposition itself in the international arena. The article has a two-sided objective. First, to analyse how nation branding and nation building strategies intersect with digital technologies and technopolitical narratives. Second, to examine how stateless nations are making use of such technologies and strategies in order to find their way in the international arena. To satisfy these objectives we have empirically studied the case of Catalonia, a stateless nation which in the last years has developed an ambitious technopolitical strategy rebranding itself as the southern European technological hub. To do so we have relied on a triangular methodological strategy combining (1) critical discourse analysis; (2) in-depth interviews with high-profile actors coming from the political, academic, and civil society landscape, and (3) a thorough documentary analysis. The first part of the article explores the concept of digital nation and its relationship with the notion of nation branding. In the second part of the text, we present the methodology and the objectives. We continue the paper by outlining the results of the interviewing process and the critical analysis of the findings. The article concludes with a critical recapitulation of the research results. © 2023 The Editor of Ethnopolitics."
"This article focuses on Samuel Beckett's selected short prose works ""The Lost Ones""and ""Ping,""which both present ruinous landscapes that have witnessed an unspeakable catastrophe. Both texts attempt to reflect such deterioration in the collapse of language. Following environmental criticism and new materialism, this paper analyses Beckett's texts as potential representatives of a poetics for the Anthropocene. Such a project withdraws from evoking spectacular images of an ecocide witnessed by narrators unaffected by the deteriorating reality; instead, it grasps the necessary crisis of narration as a part of a world that is falling apart.  © 2023 Copyright Michał Kisiel, 2023.

"Introduction: This paper presents an innovative Intelligent Robot Sports Competition Tactical Analysis Model that leverages multimodal perception to tackle the pressing challenge of analyzing opponent tactics in sports competitions. The current landscape of sports competition analysis necessitates a comprehensive understanding of opponent strategies. However, traditional methods are often constrained to a single data source or modality, limiting their ability to capture the intricate details of opponent tactics. Methods: Our system integrates the Swin Transformer and CLIP models, harnessing cross-modal transfer learning to enable a holistic observation and analysis of opponent tactics. The Swin Transformer is employed to acquire knowledge about opponent action postures and behavioral patterns in basketball or football games, while the CLIP model enhances the system's comprehension of opponent tactical information by establishing semantic associations between images and text. To address potential imbalances and biases between these models, we introduce a cross-modal transfer learning technique that mitigates modal bias issues, thereby enhancing the model's generalization performance on multimodal data. Results: Through cross-modal transfer learning, tactical information learned from images by the Swin Transformer is effectively transferred to the CLIP model, providing coaches and athletes with comprehensive tactical insights. Our method is rigorously tested and validated using Sport UV, Sports-1M, HMDB51, and NPU RGB+D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the system's impressive performance in terms of prediction accuracy, stability, training time, inference time, number of parameters, and computational complexity. Notably, the system outperforms other models, with a remarkable 8.47% lower prediction error (MAE) on the Kinetics dataset, accompanied by a 72.86-second reduction in training time. Discussion: The presented system proves to be highly suitable for real-time sports competition assistance and analysis, offering a novel and effective approach for an Intelligent Robot Sports Competition Tactical Analysis Model that maximizes the potential of multimodal perception technology. By harnessing the synergies between the Swin Transformer and CLIP models, we address the limitations of traditional methods and significantly advance the field of sports competition analysis. This innovative model opens up new avenues for comprehensive tactical analysis in sports, benefiting coaches, athletes, and sports enthusiasts alike. Copyright © 2023 Jiang and Lu."
"The paper focuses on the practices of everyday use of street names after the massive toponymic cleansing under the frameworks of decommunisation and de-Russification in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. Employing a mixed method approach, which includes a social experiment with the passersby on the streets of the city, analysis of the real estate advertisement and a series of interviews with the citizens, the authors reveal various practices of everyday use of new and old street names as a public response to the officially imposed city-text. The findings indicate that the transition from the old to the new toponymic system after the ideologically-driven toponymic cleansing does not represent an immediate and a single-step action, and should be considered a long-lasting, protracted and multi-staged process that requires several years or even decades. The gradual introduction of a new place name into various spheres of public life represents a kind of heterochronic coevolution driven by the collision of top-down vs. bottom-up interests. Another finding is that public inertia towards the new toponymic landscapes may be driven almost totally by motivations that have no relationship to ideology and politics. Also, it has been found that the actual communicative practices after the renaming depend on a variety of predominantly local factors and actors, including the specific place, place name, communicative situation and characteristics of the interlocutors. The findings are discussed in the framework of social sustainability, pointing at the need for clearly articulated and coherent municipal politics aimed at familiarising the community with newly introduced place names. © O.

"Text recognition is focused on text transcription-based image processing modeling in relevance to such domains like document digitization, content moderation, scene text translation, automation driving, scene understanding, and other related contexts. Conventional text recognition techniques are often concerned about characters-seen recognition more. However, two factors in the training set of these methods are yet to be well covered, which are novel character categories and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) samples. Newly characters-related samples are often linked with OOV-based samples. However, it may pay attention to seen characters without novel combinations or contexts. For novel character categories, internet-based environments can be mainly used to face unseen ligatures like 1) emoticons and unperceived languages, 2) scene-text recognition environments, and 3) characters from foreign and region-specific languages. For digitization profiling, the undiscovered characters may not be involved in as well. Since the heterogeneity of language format to be balanced, the linguistic statistic data (e. g., n-gram, context, etc.) can be biased the training data gradually, which is challenged for vocabulary-high-correlated text recognition methods. The two factors are required to yield three key scientific problems that affect the costs or efficiency in open-world applications. The novel characters are oriented for the novel spotting capability, whereas characters-unseen are rejected to replace silent seen characters. Furthermore, as the popular open-set recognition problem, three scientific problems can be leaked out as mentioned below. First, the emergence of novel characters is not efficient in many cases, in which re-training upon each occurrence is costly, and an incremental learning capability need to be strengthened after that. Second, an amount of attention is received as the generalized zero-shot learning text recognition task. Third, Linguistic bias robustness is yielded by the OOV samples. Due to the character-based nature prediction, more popular methods can be used to possess the capability to handle characters-seen OOV samples to some extent. However, such capabilities are constrained to demonstrate strong vocabulary reliance because of the capacity of language models, the open-set text recognition (OSTR) task is feasible since existing tasks like zero-shot text recognition and OOV recognition can be used to model individual aspects of the problems only. This task aims to spot and recognize the novel characters, which is robust to linguistic skews. As an extension of the conventional text recognition task, the OSTR task is used to retain a decent recognition capability on seen contents. In recent years, the OSTR task has been developing intensively in the context of character recognition. The literature review is carried out on the open-set text recognition task and its related domains. It consists of such five aspects of the background, genericity, the concept, implementation, and summary. For the background, we introduce the application background of the OSTR task and analyze the specific OSTR-derived cases. For genericity, the generic open-set recognition is introduced in brief as a preliminary of the OSTR task that is less familiar to some researchers in the text recognition field. For concept, the definition of the OSTR task is introduced, followed by a discussion on its relationship with existing text recognition tasks, e. g., conventional close-set text recognition task and the zero-shot text recognition task. Its implementation-wise, common text recognition frameworks are first introduced. For implementation, it can be recognized as derivations of such frameworks, where the derivation is based on the three key scientific problems as following:new category spotting, incremental recognition of novel classes, and linguistic bias robustness. Specifically, the new category spotting problem refers to rejecting samples that come from an absent class of a given label set. Slightly different from the generic open-set text recognition task, the given label-set is challenged in related to the training data straightfoward. Incremental recognition refers to new categories recognition in terms of the non-retrained side information of the corresponding categories. The definition is slightly different from the common zero-shot learning definition, it can be excluded some generative adversarial network (GAN)-based transductive approaches. The linguistic bias robustness holds its original definition beyond more stressed unseen characters. For each scientific problem, its solution can be covered in text recognition and other modeling-similar related fields. The evaluation is carried out and it can mainly cover the datasets and protocols used in the OSTR task and its contexts as listed:1) multiple protocols based public available datasets, 2) commonly used metric to measure model performance, and 3) several of popular protocols, typical methods, and the performance. Here, a protocol refers to the compositions of training sets, testing sets, and evaluation metrics. For summary, the comparative analysis of the growth and technical preference are demonstrated. Finally, the potnetialss of the trends and future research directions are predicted further. © 2023 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG. All rights reserved."
"The study analysed the driving performance and visual impairment of 92 participants under six different distraction scenarios. Using a car simulator and by simulating two real-world roads, a variety of data was collected, including driver behavior and vehicle-related data. According to a statistical analysis conducted during and before the distraction on road 1, females significantly increased speed more than males when using a hand-held call (=scenario #3), hands-free call (=scenario #4), text (=scenario #6), and voice command text (=scenario #7). The Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed on gender, age, vehicle speed, throttle, and offset from the center of the road subcategories, while selecting the more correlated variable with each type of distraction. Finally, the generalized linear regression model was used to provide a significant relationship between the frequency of distraction and highly correlated independent variables. © 2023 UNIVERSITY OF ZILINA."
"Purpose: This paper aims to reveal the interdisciplinarity of information science (IS) from the perspective of the evolution of theory application. Design/methodology/approach: Select eight representative IS journals as data sources, extract the theories mentioned in the full texts of the research papers and then measure annual interdisciplinarity of IS by conducting theory co-occurrence network analysis, diversity measure and evolution analysis. Findings: As a young and vibrant discipline, IS has been continuously absorbing and internalizing external theoretical knowledge and thus formed a high degree of interdisciplinarity. With the continuous application of some kernel theories, the interdisciplinarity of IS appears to be decreasing and gradually converging into a few neighboring disciplines. Influenced by big data and artificial intelligence, the research paradigm of IS is shifting from a theory centered one to a technology centered one. Research limitations/implications: This study helps to understand the evolution of the interdisciplinarity of IS in the past 21 years. The main limitation is that the data were collected from eight journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index and a small amount of theories might have been omitted.

It is–but it is also essentially philosophical, both when theorising intellectual history, which some intellectual historians do, and when interpreting texts, which all intellectual historians do. I demonstrate this symbiosis between history and philosophy via critical reflections on Martin Jay’s recent book Genesis and Validity. Philosophical analysis, closely integrated with historical examples, suggests that we should significantly rethink Jay’s theorisation of the relationship between genesis and validity (e.g. whether ideas from one context are valid in others). But the symbiosis between history and philosophy matters more when interpreting texts. Philosophical analysis is a powerful tool for recovering what authors meant, understanding how their ideas fit together, and seeing similarities and differences between ideas, as I show with examples from Quentin Skinner’s interpretations of Machiavelli, Hobbes and others. Yet even Jay and Skinner–two of the world’s most philosophically astute intellectual historians–overlook the crucial symbiosis between history and philosophy. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The success of protected areas in addressing global environmental change depends on the development of management strategies that are inclusive of broad values held by local community members. Here, we report on results from a longitudinal and quasi-experimental study that engaged community members in deliberation around their visions for the future of protected areas in Interior Alaska. Following a regional household survey, we purposively assembled three groups of residents according to the relative strength of their broad value orientations. Each group was engaged in online discussions over a month-long period time and a thematic analysis of the resulting transcripts was performed to understand: (1) the perceived benefits and threats facing protected areas, and (2) reflections on how public land management agencies should improve decision-making to better incorporate the perspectives of residents. Results showed that the landscape provided a multitude of benefits, such as natural beauty, opportunities for living an Alaskan lifestyle, and sense of community. Conversely, climate variability, ambivalence toward tourism, and large-scale development were the primary perceived threats. Residents also shared recommendations for how to build meaningful public engagement processes rooted in a philosophy of ‘inclusive conservation’ that solves sustainability science problems by balancing the consequences of different visions for nature-based solutions. Text-based patterns of deliberation showed that broad values affected the topics of discussion and social learning that occurred in small but meaningful ways. We suggest that people with similar values can hold distinct visions for the future, and that shared spaces for deliberation are important for enabling collective action. We also contend that protected area management decision-making should be transformed through the adoption of a value-based framework whereby guiding principles and relational learning are actively weighed in the process of developing more sustainable solutions for society’s most pressing natural resource management problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."
"Social participation of all students is a central goal of inclusive education. Research suggests that justice experiences foster a sense of belonging in school. How individual as well as contextual justice experiences are linked to social participation of adolescents has not been investigated so far. We collected data on self-reported measures of justice and social participation of 745 teenagers. We also modeled a collegial sense of needs-based justice stemming from teachers' justice ratings on text vignettes. Our analyses indicate that the schools in our sample differed significantly in their teachers' general sensitivity for needs-based justice. Multi-level models identified positive links between a student's belief in a just world as well as their experienced teacher justice and their reports of social participation. Furthermore, we found that students with special needs reported significantly lower teacher justice than their peers without special needs. All in all, our findings indicate that a just school environment can foster individual social participation. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The defect data of electric power equipment generated during the production and operation of the electric power field is widely used for judging the defect degree of the equipment, assisting the inspection personnel to store production certificates, and facilitating the on-site maintenance of maintenance personnel. During the operation of electric power equipment, it is necessary to timely and effectively judge the defect degree of the equipment as to avoid a series of cascading failures caused by the untimely treatment of critical defective equipment. It affects the power production efficiency. This paper proposes an effective method for entity disambiguation. It finds that the knowledge map of power equipment defects lacks updating measures, and gives specific updating methods for different updating reasons. The model uses the attention mechanism to extract the word importance features in the defective text, uses the enhanced coding method to recode the digital information, and the fusion layer fuses the global semantic features, digital features, and word importance features; Finally, combined with knowledge atlas, the text description of power defects with given structure is realized. The model designed by comparison can more accurately identify the entity information in the defect text. Meanwhile, it can also achieve an end-to-end analysis effect of the defect degree of the power equipment. The research part based on historical defect text uses the improved knowledge mapping technology of power equipment defect text, which explores the practicality of this technology. © 2023 SPIE."
"The article is devoted to the translation work of the Ukrainian orientalist Ahatanhel Krymsky, thanks to whose scientific and creative work the poetic heritage of the Persian Sufi poet Hafiz Shirazi entered Ukrainian culture. Krymsky had been working on artistic translations of Hafiz’s ghazals for about thirty years, starting with the first interlinear translations, which were made by an orientalist student as early as in 1891. Among Krymsky’s translation works are parallel translations (in Russian and Ukrainian) of two ghazals (№ 255 and № 96). Both ghazals are examples of poetry that reflect certain worldview orientations of the author and demonstrate the philosophical and religious, largely mystical understanding of the universe developed in Sufism. In particular, in these ghazals, you can find indications of the main characteristics of Sufis: poverty, abstinence from sleep and loneliness, which contributes to the achievement of mystical union with God. Striving to convey the meanings of Persian poetry as accurately as possible, Krymsky, at the same time, tried to adapt them to the Ukrainian and Russian readers (for example, in the place of exoticism moqilān, the translator used the expressions evil thorn and prickly thorn, which cause similar associations). A detailed textual analysis of both Hafiz’s ghazals and both parallel translations of Krymsky allows us to assert that the scholar actively sought adequate linguistic means that would allow the reader to grasp the conceptual depth of the poems, the beauty of the images, subtle artistic techniques of Hafiz’s poetry. The textological comparison of the Russian and Ukrainian versions of the translations of two ghazals shows that the diligent work of the scholar-translator led to a deeper penetration into the complex world of Hafiz’s poetic lines precisely in the Ukrainian translations, which were made later than the Russian ones. In addition, from a stylistic point of view, Ukrainian texts seem more organic and integral in comparison with Russian versions. A significant merit of Krymsky in the field of translation is the combination of a creative approach with a scientific one: each translated text is accompanied by a passportization, as well as a Cyrillic transliteration of the first line, which opens up opportunities for a comprehensive comparison of both variants of ghazals and their translations in different languages. © 2023 M.

"Objective. Social education is no stranger to the changes of today’s increasingly technological society. In this sense, this study aims to provide an updated overview of the the present status of the question, based on an international systematic review of the scientific literature in social education, key concepts (professionalization, identity, and professional development), and Web 2.0. Methodology. Qualitative research was conducted, based on a systematic review of international literature between 2012 and 2021. The study utilized the PRISMA-P tool as a reference, specifically by conducting a content analysis using Nvivo 12 Version Release 1.5 software. Among other strategies, the study conducted text searches and employed hierarchical maps and coding matrices. The final selection contained 22 articles that were reviewed and categorized from an inductive-deductive approach. Results. Social media have a notorious impact on fundamental aspects of social education such as professionalization, identity, and professional development. The study highlights the need for competence development of social educators for an ethical performance of their work in the virtual space. Conclusion. In today’s technologized society, the use of social media continues its exponential rise, and the profession of social education must also seek its place in the virtual environment, recognizing that the profession has to respond to a society in which the Internet is a communication space. In this sense, a wider definition of digital competencies in social education is advocated. © 2023 Universidad Nacional. All rights reserved."
"Objective: This study is the first to explore user behavior and characterize the content shared about digital inclusion on Twitter. Methods: This mixed-methods research consists of 14,000 tweets featuring the hashtag “#digitalinclusion,” posted on Twitter over 15 months. A machine learning technique, latent Dirichlet allocation, was utilized to discover abstract topics within the tweets statistically. The algorithm identified important keywords and text associated with each topic by modeling the underlying word co-occurrence patterns in the dataset. A manual qualitative content analysis was applied to the qualitative data (1000 tweets). Results: Tweets containing #digitalinclusion are driven by four motives: 1) warning against the risks of digital exclusion; 2) tweets that promote actions to increase digital inclusion; 3) tweets that call for others to take action to improve digitalization; and 4) tweets that are neutral but fuel the debate by being active. Quantitative analysis revealed that users discussing digital inclusion come from various continents, including the USA, Europe, Africa, and Asia. There were 3931 unique user accounts, with individuals posting between one and 368 tweets. Approximately half of the tweets contained some embedded media. Conclusion: The study concludes that digital inclusion is a subject that engages Twitter users worldwide. Tweets that were associated with community and local initiatives and sustainable development had the highest engagement in terms of the number of retweets and likes. The interpretation is that digital inclusion is crucial for achieving equity in living conditions and enhancing access to health information and services. While initiatives to increase digital inclusion are underway, Twitter users call for more efforts to prevent growing digital exclusion. Twitter, as a social media platform, is valuable for studying the motivations that drive digital inclusion and help counter digital exclusion. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The word-formation analyzer for teaching Czech to foreigners (SLAN) is a didactic tool that processes word formation for the needs of teaching Czech as a second/foreign language. The tool represents an opportunity to systematically work with word formation when teaching foreigners and to take advantage of the fact that more than two-thirds of the Czech vocabulary consists of derived words (Dokulil 1962: 105). Specifically, it is about using word-formation meaning, i.e. meaning resulting from the structure of derived words, when clarifying new vocabulary. Such a method complies with the basic didactic principle that an unknown (derived) word is explained using a known (basic) word. The core of the SLAN tool is lists made up of pairs of words base word → derived word, e.g. bydlet 'to live' → bydliště 'residence', which are used by teachers to create their own teaching materials that take word formation into account. Word lists can be generated according to formal criteria (e.g. derived words ending in a selected suffix) as well as semantic criteria (e.g. derived words denoting place names). The tool also includes methodological support intended for teachers and texts for practising word-formation affinity (based on word-formation meaning). The primary source of SLAN data is the UčebKo textbook corpora, thanks to which students work only with words that they actually encounter at their level (A2, B1, or B2). © 2023 Faculty of Arts.

"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important area of artificial intelligence. It integrates multiple modalities such as text, audio, video and image into a compact multimodal representation and obtains sentiment information from them. In this paper, we improve two modules, i.e., feature extraction and feature fusion, to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis and finally propose an attention-based two-layer bidirectional GRU (AB-GRU, gated recurrent unit) multimodal sentiment analysis method. For the feature extraction module, we use a two-layer bidirectional GRU network and connect two layers of attention mechanisms to enhance the extraction of important information. The feature fusion part uses low-rank multimodal fusion, which can reduce the multimodal data dimensionality and improve the computational rate and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the AB-GRU model can achieve 80.9% accuracy on the CMU-MOSI dataset, which exceeds the same model type by at least 2.5%. The AB-GRU model also possesses a strong generalization capability and solid robustness. © 2023 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences. All rights reserved."
"Background: The presence of an outer shell has been recently described as a common feature of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) thrombi. We performed a systematic review of the current literature on shell genesis, structure, and clinical significance. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies reporting the composition and structure of AIS thrombi and clot analogs. Identified studies were added to Covidence software for primary screening. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening. Results: From 1290 identified studies, 10 were included in this review. Studies using histology/immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence described fibrin, platelets, von Willebrand factor, and neutrophil extracellular traps as the main components of the shell. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a dense, compact fibrin/platelet-rich shell, and a core rich in polyhedrocytes. Microfluidics studies identified highly activated P-selectin-positive platelets and fibrin forming the core while secondary agonists adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane, along with loosely packed P-selectin-negative platelets constituted the shell. Conclusions: The composition, compaction, and integrity of the shell may impact thrombolysis and revascularization outcomes. The preponderance of studies supported this conclusion. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Self-efficacy (SE) is the main predictor of self-care behaviour in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Several studies identified factors that influence SE in CHD patients. However, review studies have yet to synthesize these results systematically. This review aims to identify SE and the factors influencing SE in CHD patients. This scoping review is reported based on the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched using relevant keywords using five databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text and Academic Search Complete, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Taylor and Francis, and one search engine: Google Scholar, which was accessed on June 23, 2023. Articles with an observational design were included without date restrictions. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist, and data synthesis used thematic analysis. We found 11 articles discussing SE and the factors influencing SE in CHD patients. In this review, most studies reported that the SE level of CHD patients tends to be low to moderate. Factors associated with SE in this population are classified into three categories (low, moderate, and high). Cardiac knowledge and patient activation are the most influential predictors of SE in CHD patients. Public health interventions such as raising awareness about heart disease, modifying health behaviours, early screening, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment are critical to improving SE and cardiac care outcomes. © 2023 Sugiharto et al.

"While literature is often used as a source of examples and illustrations across disciplines, literary studies tends to be underrepresented in interdisciplinary exchanges. Perhaps the reason lies in a lack of understanding what actually is the expertise of literary studies and how this can be useful in interdisciplinary settings. In this article, I propose to outline the expertise of literary scholars through concepts of 4E cognition and to devise a proposal for how such expertise could successfully shape the epistemic common ground of social cognition of experts in interdisciplinary dialogue. Literature involves metacognition centrally through its language style, the design of the narrative and its links to other texts, and literary scholars have the expertise in formulating exactly how this works–in a non-mimetic way–through the analysis and interpretation of literary texts. This very particular expertise and practice of literary scholars enables literary texts to be proposed as a boundary object in interdisciplinary dialogues through a shared epistemic common ground. For this argument, I build on earlier theoretical work in 4E cognition and predictive processing and my experience running interdisciplinary workshops on that model. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Purpose: The study aims to estimate the prevalence of workplace bullying, personal and work-related impacts, reporting practices for bullying, and the reasons for not reporting bullying incidents in the New Zealand pharmacy sector. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted among registered pharmacists and pharmacist interns in New Zealand from June to August 2020. The questionnaire comprises both close-ended and semi-structured free-text questions. Goldberg’s 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessed the respondents’ general psychological health status, and a 22-item Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R) was used to estimate bullying prevalence together with the self-rated/self-labeled questions. The qualitative information obtained from the free-text responses was used to support and elaborate on the quantitative results. Findings: The self-labeled prevalence of workplace bullying was 36.9%, with almost 10% reporting it occurring almost daily to several times per week. The 54.7% prevalence based on the NAQ-R assessment compares well with the prevalence of witnessing the incidents (58.5%). Psychological distress symptoms were experienced by 37.1% in pre-COVID and 45.3% during COVID-year 1. Supervisors or direct managers were the commonest perpetrators (32.7%). Only 28.8% of those who experienced bullying had reported the incidents formally. Research limitations/implications: This study is cross-sectional, and the relationships indicated are bi-directional. The consistency of the results is reassuring, however inferring causality of effect is challenging. Future studies and analyses should focus on this. This study suggests that in the pharmacy environment bullying from the top is reasonably prevalent, is not commonly reported and requires the design and implementation of prevention and management strategies that take into account and mitigate these bullying factors. Professional pharmacy leadership organizations, National Health Authority and Pharmacy regulators could play a significant role in awareness and training to reduce bullying with the development and promotion of strategies to curb it and improve reporting. Originality/value: This is the first paper to describe the prevalence and impact of workplace bullying, and the practices of reporting bullying incidents in the New Zealand pharmacy sector. Based on empirical evidence, pharmacists represent a small share of total healthcare workforce, yet the overall prevalence of bullying is consistent with professions with much larger numbers such as medicine and nursing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The objective of the study is to summarize current literature on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) use for different indications in pediatric patient excluding acute bronchiolitis and neonatal care. The study design is a systematic scoping review. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched in February, 2023. All abstracts and full texts were screened by two independent reviewers. Randomized controlled trials focusing on HFNC use in pediatric patients (age < 18 years) were included. Studies focusing on acute bronchiolitis and neonatal respiratory conditions were excluded. Study quality was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool. The main outcomes are patient groups and indications, key outcomes, and risk of bias. After screening 1276 abstracts, we included 22 full reports. Risk of bias was low in 11 and high in 5 studies. We identified three patient groups where HFNC has been studied: first, children requiring primary respiratory support for acute respiratory failure; second, perioperative use for either intraprocedural oxygenation or postoperative respiratory support; and third, post-extubation care in pediatric intensive care for other than postoperative patients. Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed as key outcomes. None of the studies analyzed cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: This systematic scoping review provides an overview of current evidence for HFNC use in pediatric patients. Future studies should aim for better quality and include economic evaluation with cost-effectiveness analysis.

"Background and aims: The main purpose of this analysis was to provide an understanding of the concept of professional prestige in nursing. Methods: Determining which nurses have professional prestige requires a clear definition and explanation of the different dimensions of this concept. Therefore, the current study was conducted with the aim of explaining the concept of professional prestige in nursing. Walker and Avant’s method was used to determine the defining features of the concept. The review of texts available in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Magiran databases with the keywords professional prestige, occupational prestige, professional dignity, professional status, professional image, and nursing without a time limit resulted in 24 articles based on the entry criteria. Results: Professional prestige in nursing was defined. The defining features of this concept include social status, income and salary, job satisfaction, independence in decision-making, professional commitment, self-confidence, education, and continuous training. It also includes social status effective in promoting professional commitment and independence in decision-making in nurses, which ultimately leads to the provision of safe care services for patients. Conclusion: The results of the analysis in this study can provide an objective and comprehensible picture of the professional prestige of nursing. This can be an effective step for training, strengthening, measuring, and developing this concept to provide quality and safe nursing services by nurses. © 2023 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

"Twitter is one of the micro-blogging platforms in social media that is being used by many users to voice their opinions and expressions. Thus, it acts as a rich source for analyzing effective texts. This work proposes to predict multi-class emotions from tweets. Tweets are short text with a restricted number of words, include emoticons and emojis to express the content in a picturized way, involve contractions and slang, and contain various components such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and so on. Hence, a methodology that involves tweet-specific pre-processing strategies is necessitated. Further, it is realized that the exploitation of sentence embedding features about emotion identification in tweets is minimal. In this regard, the proposed methodology involves tweet collection, tweet pre-processing through natural language processing techniques to derive pre-processed tweet sentences and pre-processed tweet words, feature vector formulation through polarity of pre-processed tweet sentences and sentence embedding of pre-processed tweet sentences and word embedding of pre-processed tweet words derived through bidirectional encoder representation transformers, classification through deep neural networks, evaluation through train-test methodology and evolving of optimized weights for emotion identification from tweets with improved accuracy. The methodology is evaluated on a public dataset, Twitter Reviews for Emotion Analysis, available in the Kaggle repository using metrics namely accuracy, recall, precision, and f-measure. Various combinations of features have been provided as input to assess the best combination of features that yields the highest possible performance. Further, the parameters of the deep neural network namely dropout percentage are tuned to accomplish the best performance. As the dataset is imbalanced, the impact of class weights is analyzed to achieve better outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers."
"This study provides a linguistic analysis of three modern slavery disclosure regulations, the California Transparency in the Supply Chain Act (CTSCA) 2010, section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018. These regulations require companies to report their actions to tackle labour exploitation within global supply chains. Based on World-System Theory (WST: Wallerstein, 1975, 1979, 2015) and by relying on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we examined the disclosure regulations and found that the texts of and discourses around the regulations are not neutral and allow social wrongs to continue in global supply chains. Although regulators claim modern slavery disclosure regulations to be a step in the right direction, our investigation reveals a different picture: the linguistic features of the regulations support the perpetuating risk of modern slavery in global supply chains based in the periphery countries. We argue that changing the current global power structure/system is necessary to address the grand challenges of regulating modern slavery. There is a need for disclosure regime that can protect vulnerable communities, including workers in the global supply chains. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Accepting the anthropological perspective of analysing oral folklore, understood as a part of culture – any culture – requires a redefinition of the notion of orality in contemporary culture. Orality does not mean solely oral direct transmission of texts; it also reveals a way in which human beings operate in their world, as well as the manner of its cognition formed by folk-type thinking. A message may also be transmitted in the form of visual or electronic communication. Analysing contemporary folkloric texts from the anthropological perspective requires changing the existing method of acquiring research material. This includes primarily the situation in which the given text is realized. The cultural context is especially significant in analysing Internet-based form of folkloric communication, where it is necessary to take the role of virtual community into account. By penetrating the Internet, the content which until then functioned outside it is subjected to changes resulting from the Internet-related inspiration. It therefore co-creates e-folklore, the analysis of which must take the exceptional activity of Internet users into consideration. The process of contemporary cultural socialisation has been in a nearly natural way enriched by folkloric orality. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Research work on the grammatical features of academic writing has revealed that science writing relies more on phrases and nominalization, and humanities writing on clauses. Embedded clauses, however, occur at the rank of a word phrase, and the extent to which the two genres differ in their use of embedded clauses is not well understood. To address this gap, this study investigated the occurrence rates (per 1,000 words) of 10 categories of embedded clauses in a corpus of 40 research articles from cell biology and classics. The analysis relied on a modified form of the Hallidayan framework. The results reveal that classics articles use more embedded clauses, and biology articles, more ranking clauses. As embedding involves layering, this finding implies a more complex clausal structure in the case of classics articles. With only two exceptions, the rates of embedded clauses are higher in classics articles than in biology articles. The exceptions involve the greater use of –ed and –ing relative clauses in biology articles, particularly in the adjunct position. The higher rates of non-finite relatives in biology articles reflect the condensed nature of science writing. Further work involving text samples from more disciplines and interdisciplinary fields is recommended. © 2023 International Linguistic Association."
"This chapter gives an overview of the history of Ireland’s constitutional ban on abortion and feminist mobilisations against it, culminating in 66.4% of the Irish electorate voting to repeal the amendment on May 25, 2018. It then examines tweets using the hashtag #repealthe8th, one small, but vibrant, public forum for discussion about the ban. These tweets provide a valuable source of real-time and unsolicited data on how and by whom the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment was discussed, organised, supported, and opposed on the platform during a period of significant activity and change. I map overall use of the hashtag and, by identifying latent text patterns across the tweets, unpack the content to capture key features of the hashtag use.

"The Internet has become one of the significant sources for sharing information and expressing users’ opinions about products and their interests with the associated aspects. It is essential to learn about product reviews; however, to react to such reviews, extracting aspects of the entity to which these reviews belong is equally important. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) refers to aspects extracted from an opinionated text. The literature proposes different approaches for ABSA; however, most research is focused on supervised approaches, which require labeled datasets with manual sentiment polarity labeling and aspect tagging. This study proposes a semi-supervised approach with minimal human supervision to extract aspect terms by detecting the aspect categories. Hence, the study deals with two main sub-tasks in ABSA, named Aspect Category Detection (ACD) and Aspect Term Extraction (ATE). In the first sub-task, aspects categories are extracted using topic modeling and filtered by an oracle further, and it is fed to zero-shot learning as the prompts and the augmented text. The predicted categories are the input to find similar phrases curated with extracting meaningful phrases (e.g., Nouns, Proper Nouns, NER (Named Entity Recognition) entities) to detect the aspect terms. The study sets a baseline accuracy for two main sub-tasks in ABSA on the Multi-Aspect Multi-Sentiment (MAMS) dataset along with SemEval-2014 Task 4 subtask 1 to show that the proposed approach helps detect aspect terms via aspect categories. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

"The article is a systematic review of patient safety in hospital centers as a commitment to health quality carried out during the year 2022. From a total of 800 investigations related to the topic, 25 were selected through Patient Safety and Health Quality, Patient Safety OR Health Quality commands supported by the Consort flowchart and instruments: Prisma, Pico, and Progres. The data collected included the following sequence: a) Identification of the topic in the documents; b) Pre-selection phase, finding 700 articles screened; c) Selection phase: 25 articles; d) Grouping of information in instruments for analysis. The inclusion criteria were articles comprised between 2016 and 2022, with full text and open access, included in the PubMed database, and related to the study category, which declared no conflicts of interest. It is concluded that there is no research at the local level. The patient safety culture that intervenes in the quality of care is the correct identification of the patient, which helps to reduce adverse events in health care, being necessary to place bracelets on patients; timely communication by the staff avoids errors of omission. Adverse events are surgical complications, infections, and falls, due to staff exhaustion caused by workload. The application of the SBAR technique in the reports maintains a structured communication, being used by the nursing staff to give a detailed report of the patient's condition. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd.

"Irony is the use of counterwords, irony and other techniques to reflect the essential characteristics of people and things, and is a way to express emotions. Irony detection is an important research content in the field of sentiment analysis, and it is also one of the hot issues in the research of artificial intelligence in natural language processing. In this paper, a sentimental ironic detection model based on multi-feature fusion is proposed, which takes text features, image features and image attribute features as inputs, and image attribute features are represented by adjective-noun pairs abbreviated as ANPs. In this model, the neural network is first used to extract features from the three inputs, and then the text features and image features are fused through the shared fusion network, and the contrast fusion network fuses the text features and image attribute features, so as to express the contrast and difference of graphic and text information. Finally, satirical classification is carried out through the classification layer. Experimental results show that the model achieves good performance on the public multimodal irony detection dataset. © 2023 SPIE."
"In order to improve the efficiency of obtaining open source aerospace information，and solve the problems of long open source aerospace information content，relatively limited quantity，poor robustness of commonly used text classification models，and unintuitive text information，this paper proposes a method for aerospace information text classification based on supervised contrastive learning. The method is based on the bidirectional long short-term memory（BiLSTM）network with the attention mechanism， integrates comparative learning technology，processes and analyzes open source information，efficiently screenes out aerospace information，and uses the unCLIP（un-Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training） model to generate an image corresponding to the information. The experimental results show that compared with commonly used text classification methods such as CNN（Convolutional Neural Networks），BiLSTM， Transformer and BiLSTM-Attention，this method performes well in accuracy，recall and F1-Score，among them，F1-Score reaches 0. 97. At the same time，information is presented in the form of images to make information clearer and more intuitive. It can make full use of open data resources on the network，effectively extract open-source space information and generate corresponding images，which is of great value to the analysis and research of aerospace information. © 2023, Science Press.

"Introduction: Machine-assisted topic analysis (MATA) uses artificial intelligence methods to help qualitative researchers analyze large datasets. This is useful for researchers to rapidly update healthcare interventions during changing healthcare contexts, such as a pandemic. We examined the potential to support healthcare interventions by comparing MATA with “human-only” thematic analysis techniques on the same dataset (1,472 user responses from a COVID-19 behavioral intervention). Methods: In MATA, an unsupervised topic-modeling approach identified latent topics in the text, from which researchers identified broad themes. In human-only codebook analysis, researchers developed an initial codebook based on previous research that was applied to the dataset by the team, who met regularly to discuss and refine the codes. Formal triangulation using a “convergence coding matrix” compared findings between methods, categorizing them as “agreement”, “complementary”, “dissonant”, or “silent”. Results: Human analysis took much longer than MATA (147.5 vs. 40 h). Both methods identified key themes about what users found helpful and unhelpful. Formal triangulation showed both sets of findings were highly similar. The formal triangulation showed high similarity between the findings. All MATA codes were classified as in agreement or complementary to the human themes. When findings differed slightly, this was due to human researcher interpretations or nuance from human-only analysis. Discussion: Results produced by MATA were similar to human-only thematic analysis, with substantial time savings. For simple analyses that do not require an in-depth or subtle understanding of the data, MATA is a useful tool that can support qualitative researchers to interpret and analyze large datasets quickly. This approach can support intervention development and implementation, such as enabling rapid optimization during public health emergencies.

"Objective: To construct an index to determine the sexual vulnerability of trans women. Materials and Methods: Mixed study conducted between 2020 and 2021, which in its first phase used content analysis for texts describing the basic concepts of vulnerability, social vulnerability and risk. This was supported by accounts from focus groups and interviews with 14 transgender women to generate the theoretical construct of sexual vulnerability of transgender women. For the second phase, from the information provided by 417 transgender women from the cities of Bogotá and Cali, who participated in the study “Vulnerability and HIV Prevalence in Transgender Women in three cities of Colombia: Bogota, Medellin and Santiago de Cali-2019”, variables were selected to be part of an exploratory factor analysis to construct the preliminary version of the index. Results: The sexual vulnerability risk index of transgender women was based on 3 factors: social support, sexual practices, and health care. The index consisted of 10 questions scored as 0 or 1, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of sexual vulnerability. Conclusions: Sexual vulnerability is a phenomenon based on factors which are specific to the trans experience and it is influenced by the characteristics of the context in which the person lives. The constructed index has good internal consistency (ordinal alpha 0.90) and shows concordance between the theoretical model of the qualitative phase and the results of the exploratory factor analysis. © 2023, Universidad de Concepcion.

"Technology has revolutionized the education system. Many tools such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) were developed to enhance the learning process. With this new technology, teachers and universities can explore options otherwise difficult to implement. Keeping students engaged is one of the biggest challenges that educational institutions face. Students’ motivation, engagement, and performance can be affected by using LMS. Strategies like self-regulated learning, gamification, and real-time at-risk student detection can be more easily implemented. The analysis of the effects of LMS on learning is made in form of a systematic literature review (SLR). 33 studies published after 2017 were extracted for full-text analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The migration patterns of farmers, rural women, and youth within agricultural households have a significant impact on rural communities and the agricultural sector. To gain a deeper understanding of research trends in migration behavior, a study was conducted using comprehensive bibliometric analysis and text mining. René Descartes’ Discourse framework was employed to analyze 504 research articles retrieved from the Dimension.ai database followed by further analysis with Microsoft Excel, R software and VOS viewer. The study revealed a growing interest of various stakeholders in this field, with an increasing number of publications focusing on various aspects from 1934 to 2023. In terms of the publication’s performance analysis, the study identified human society and the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) as the most significant research areas. These areas aim to address hunger and improve food security for migrants. Regarding migration studies, three influential journals—Sustainability, World Development, and Journal of Rural Studies—were identified, with the most influential author being J. Vernon Henderson from the United Kingdom. Citation analysis was conducted to determine the highest number of citations for the influential author (J. V. Hernderon), journal (World Development), organization (World Bank), and country (United States) based on scientific attribution. Additionally, a co-word analysis was performed to research article’s abstracts to map into key thematic clusters that include climate change, food insecurity, and the COVID-19 crisis. The study visualized the social network of authors, organizations, and countries involved in co-authorship analysis within the research field. Furthermore, a journal co-citation analysis was undertaken to reveal the intellectual structure of migration studies in the agricultural context. Text mining of the research documents uncovered both anticipated and unanticipated effects of migration on households. Consequently, these findings provide valuable insights into future research directions and evidence-based policy framing which will contribute to shielding agricultural households from unforeseen consequences of migration, benefiting researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in this arena.

"The article deals with logic abstraction operations, such as isolation, identification and generalization and their algorithmic implementation using the meta-programming language Sympl, which is being developed by the author. As part of the implemented logic operations, new data types such as “identification set"", ""concept"", “notion” and ""category"" were implemented. The data type “identification set” represents sets, the elements of which all have either common properties or relations and are the result of the application of identification operation to logical objects. The data type “concept” is used for representation of concepts that are results of application of identification and generalization operations and is represented by two daughter data types (subtypes): “notion” and “category”. The “notion” data type represents the result of application of abstraction of generalization to an identification set. The application of abstraction of generalization two (or more times) results in a “category” data type - an extremely broad notion. The developed algorithms can be applied in text analysis when words are presented as logical objects: for finding synonyms, functionally similar personages or objects by their description and activities and so on. © 2023 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

"Of the small corpus of works on vellum and paper attributed to the Tuscan Dominican friar and artist Fra Angelico (c.1400–55) and his circle, one drawing has been repeatedly singled out as widely accepted to be by his hand: King David Playing a Psaltery (c.1430) (now British Museum, London). The vellum leaf on which Fra Angelico drew features text on its verso that has until now been misunderstood as a fragment of a fifteenth-century breviary, leading it to be positioned simply as an example of his work as an illuminator. This article demonstrates that despite this misunderstanding, there is indeed an important relationship between the text and image on this sheet. The text is a fragment of a twelfth-century choir psalter and is significant as perhaps the oldest surviving evidence of the liturgy of the Papal Curia. Through a combination of palaeographical, liturgical, and art-historical analysis, I identify the leaf as a central Italian fragment dating to c.1150–80, which Fra Angelico encountered as a result of the presence of the Papal Curia in Florence during the papacy of Eugene IV, from 1434 to 1436 and again from 1439 to 1443. Stylistic and iconographic analysis demonstrates that Fra Angelico deliberately evoked the antique mode of the prefatory miniature in response to the age of the leaf, making the drawing an early example of the Renaissance desire to emulate classical models, received through a Carolingian filter. The close relationship between the David drawing and Fra Angelico’s work for Cosimo de’ Medici’s cell in San Marco—after the latter’s return to Florence from exile in 1434, supported by Eugene IV—is identified for the first time. The date of the drawing is refined from c.1430 to c.1435, the year Fra Angelico and his community moved from Fiesole to San Marco in Florence. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"This paper aims to study how different musical act modes influence the student’s psychological state, creative development, and music appreciation. In particular, the research focuses on concert videos, video clips, and audio records. Based on the Likert scale, the authors determined that video clips significantly influenced students’ learning process since they contributed to the combination of visual and sound effects. Video concerts were less important. Concerts are mainly staged actions with frequent use of pre-recorded music, affecting the accuracy of singing techniques. The authors concluded that the most effective approach is systematical learning using the effect of colors and sounds with a preliminary analysis of musical compositions. The results showed that the most significant number of students significantly improved their knowledge (87%, with an average score of 0.92), and the elements of a musical act (rhythm, color scheme, text, and performance) influenced their development. The practical significance of the paper lies in the use of approaches to learning using colors and sound effects with an emphasis on the development of certain elements. The study prospects involve determining how effectively the elements of a musical act influence the psychological state resulting from comparing music genres. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Many scholars have used local Chinese county gazetteers for historical and socioeconomic analyses, yet little research has examined the completeness of coverage or the biases in reporting that characterize the compilation of these gazetteers. In this paper, we provide a novel source for studying Chinese political movements and local history under the communist regime after 1949: the internal-discussion drafts of county gazetteers (xianzhi pingyigao). Our findings constitute the first study to use internal review drafts to examine the authenticity and credibility of county gazetteers. Prior to their publication, gazetteer drafts are compiled by a team of editors and typically receive at least three rounds of rigorous internal review. These internal-discussion drafts are subject to a prolonged and strict process of self and external censorship. Our analysis engages in a close comparison of text samples extracted from two versions of local gazetteers collected from four counties in Guangxi province. Compared to the draft versions, we find evidence of serious data manipulation and a tendency to underreport historical events in the published editions. Our research evidently demonstrates the process of historiography editing and reveals how local history is presented through the lens of government public documents in China. © 2023 Cambridge University Press.

"This article examines the representation of postcolonial marginalisation and adaptive/reactive models of masculinity in NoViolet Bulawayo's novel, We Need New Names. It focuses on the representations of masculinities in the text and their ramifications and entanglements at the global, regional and local levels. The analysis is mediated via a triangulation of the concepts of hegemonic masculinity, masculine (over)compensation and masculine hybridisation. It establishes that a culture of both hegemony and domination mediates and permeates masculine relations resulting in the enactment of reactive and adaptive responses in the form of both masculine (over)compensation and masculine hybridisation. These responses are mainly enacted by those subaltern masculinities who are at the receiving end of domination and hegemony. Additionally, these responses favour the enhancement of male domination and/or patriarchy as opposed to gender equality. They also do not favour the promotion of a culture of tolerance, democracy and/or human rights discourses that are central to the realities of much of the contemporary world.  © 2023 Copyright Anias Mutekwa, 2023.

"There is a dearth of scholarly work that measures the quality of journalism, both in Western contexts and in the Global South. This might be partly explained by the difficulty in defining, operationalising and measuring news media quality. However, those data would be helpful to identify the societal role of radio journalism in enabling citizens to participate and take decisions. As radio plays an overarching role in Tanzania for information, especially for those living in rural areas, this article assessed research data from the “Yearbook on Media Quality in Tanzania” that has identified quality as a list of criteria describing various characteristics of journalistic texts and set thresholds to distinguish good from poor quality. Thus, it measured the quality performance of 30 print, radio and TV media houses. This article now assesses radio journalism in the country, with a focus on comparison amongst radio stations. The assessment shows that some quality criteria were almost not fulfilled at all, although they are acknowledged as important, for example, the right of reply, or covering viewpoints that are critical to the government. Nevertheless, with regard to professionalism and comprehensive reporting, the data show that some radio stations perform largely better than others and that programmes are much better compared to newscasts. The external environment plays an important role in performance. Many shortcomings in quality are due to the harsh political environment and economic challenges. However, the internal newsroom environment plays an additional role and explains as well some of the quality differences identified. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Objective: To review the published literature on decisional regret in adult patients undergoing operative otolaryngology procedures. The primary outcome was decisional regret scale (DRS) scores. DRS scores of 0 indicate no regret, 1–25 mild regret, and >25 moderate to strong/severe regret. Data Sources: A comprehensive librarian-designed strategy was used to search MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to September 2023. Review Methods: Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language studies of adult patients who underwent operative otolaryngology treatments and reported DRS scores. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Oxford Centre's Levels of Evidence were used for quality assessment. Results: In total, 6306 studies were screened by two independent reviewers; 13 studies were included after full-text analysis. Subspecialties comprised: Head and neck (10), endocrine (1), general (1), and rhinology (1). The DRS results of the included studies spanned a mean range of 10.1–23.9 or a median range of 0–20.0. There was a trend toward more decisional regret after large head and neck procedures or when patients underwent multiple treatment modalities. Depression, anxiety, and patient-reported quality of life measures were all correlated with decisional regret. Oxford Centre's Levels of Evidence ranged from 2 to 4. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive review of decisional regret in otolaryngology. The majority of patients had no or mild (DRS <25) decisional regret after otolaryngology treatments. Future research on pre-operative counseling and shared decision-making to further minimize patient decisional regret is warranted. Level of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 2023. © 2023 The Authors.

"Conventional Buddhist texts illustrate meditation as a condition of relaxed alertness that must fend against extreme hypoarousal (sleep, drowsiness) and extreme hyperarousal (restlessness). Theoretical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging investigations of meditation have highlighted the relaxing effects and hypoarousing without emphasizing the alertness-promoting effects. Here we performed a systematic review supported by an activation-likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis in an effort to counterbalance the surfeit of scholarship emphasizing the hypoarousing and relaxing effects of different forms of Buddhist meditation. Specifically, the current systematic review-cum-meta-analytical review seeks to highlight more support for meditation’s wake-promoting effects by drawing from neuroimaging research during wakefulness and meditation. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 fMRI studies, we aim to highlight support for Buddhist meditation’s wake-promoting or arousing effects by identifying brain regions associated with alertness during meditation. The most significant peaks were localized medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and precuneus. We failed to determine areas ostensibly common to alertness-related meditation such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), superior parietal lobule, basal ganglia, thalamus, most likely due to the relatively fewer fMRI investigations that used wakefulness-promoting meditation techniques. Also, we argue that forthcoming research on meditation, related to alertness or wakefulness, continues to adopt a multi-modal method to investigate the correlation between actual behaviors and neural networks connected to Buddhist meditation. Moreover, we recommend the implementation of fMRI paradigms on Buddhist meditation with clinically diagnosed participants to complement recent trends in psychotherapy such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).

"High-performing neural networks for vision have dramatically advanced our ability to account for neural data in biological systems. Recently, further improvement in performance of these neural networks has been catalysed by joint training on images and natural language, increased dataset sizes and data diversity. We explored whether the same factors (joint training, dataset size and diversity) support similar improvements in the prediction of visual responses in the human brain. We used models pretrained with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)—which learns image embeddings that best match text embeddings of image captions from diverse, large-scale datasets—to study visual representations. We built voxelwise encoding models based on CLIP image features to predict brain responses to real-world images. We found that ResNet50 with CLIP is a better model of high-level visual cortex, explaining up to R 2 = 79% of variance in voxel responses in held-out test data, a substantial increase from models trained only with image/label pairs (ImageNet trained ResNet) or text (BERT). Comparisons across different model backbones ruled out network architecture as a factor in performance improvements. Comparisons across models that controlled for dataset size and data diversity demonstrated that language feedback along with large and diverse datasets are important factors in explaining neural responses in high-level visual brain regions. Visualizations of model embeddings and principal component analysis revealed that our models capture both global and fine-grained semantic dimensions represented within human visual cortex. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"The aim of this study is to analyze the shift in the social media discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included Turkish users on Twitter, who shared opinions about the pandemic between March 9 and October 31, 2020. The collected tweets were first classified with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, which used the global vector for word representation embedding method. In addition, due to the grammatical and semantic structure of the Turkish language, we employed the Zemberek library for the text pre-processing stage. We analyzed data according to two categories: user-to-public posts and user-to-user posts. User-to-user data were investigated with effective social network analysis techniques. Empirical results showed that Twitter users posted and disseminated information mainly related to economy, politics and world topics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Stance detection estimates the stance of a user towards a specific target through the text that the user posts. As an important step in public-opinion mining, stance detection has great potential for wide application and provides necessary data for decision-making by governments and enterprises. On social media, people exchange ideas by replies, in which the texts of replies are closely related to the context. Existing works in this regard focus mainly on the method of aggregating the context, but overlook the fact that the theme of texts alters with the progress of the response. Therefore, we propose a stance detection model that can effectively learn the thematic information, where contrastive learning is used to enhance the learning effect of thematic information. Experiments were performed on CreateDebate and Kialo datasets, and our proposed model achieved an accuracy of 68.0% and 69.6% on the two datasets, respectively. Experiments have proved that our method can improve the performance of stance detection. © 2023 SPIE."
"Researchers have applied marvelous endeavors in developing and designing methodologies to understand the behavioral of social media data. Various social media data have allegedly been used as a platform of rumor promotions with momentous political, economic, personal and social outcomes in numerous countries. In the existing approaches, diffusion rate of rumor words in terms of continuous and discrete time is not analyzed on the basis of their contextual polarity including their impact on social media users. It has been observed that the trust on rumor words based on user classification also plays a significant role which needs to be addressed. Therefore, we designed rumor detection and analysis methodologies in continuous and discrete time via deep learning. An efficient preprocessing approach is designed to clean the collected data. A weigh-based threshold mechanism is opted to compute various rumor-based features and their diffusion tendency in the continuous and discrete case. The proposed approach is tested on five sets of real-time data and on comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods which are CNN, KNN, LSTM and Word2Vec and noticed that rumor keyword recall and rumor keyword precision has been significantly improved. Efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of rumor-based keyword detection is also computed in which proposed approach detects 84.58, 83.46, 83.59, 83.05 and 84.47 with less loss of data than existing SOTA methods. Computation time of proposed approach is 0.59, 0.53, 0.57, 0.49, 0.47 for CoAID, FakeNewsNet, LIAR, CORD-19 and PHEME, respectively, which is quite less than SOTA methods (LSTM, CNN, Word2Vec and KNN). Practically, our proposed approach will play a significant role to improve the eminence of the rumor detection mechanism for social media platforms. Further, if we categorize the people on the basis of their influential role to spread rumor, then the trust factor based on user’s classification is computed. A real-time case study is an evidence of the efficiency of our proposed approach which provide empirical findings of detecting online rumor including trust based on social media user crowd.

"Background: Psoriasis is nowadays regarded as a systemic inflammatory disorder. Among the topicals, vitamin D derivates are often applied on the skin for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties. Vitamin D serum levels in psoriasis (PsO) patients are still debated and an eventual depletion may offer the rational to integrate anti-psoriatic therapies with oral vitamin D. Then, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the current evidence towards serum vitamin D level in PsO. Methods: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, ScienceDirect and Science Information Database (SID) using the terms “Vitamin D” and “Psoriasis” including manuscripts in English, Italian and Persian. Duplications were excluded using EndNote software and records were screened by title, abstract and full-text. Quality assessment of studies was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Checklist (NOS). Psoriasis odds ratio (OR) and mean serum vitamin D levels were calculated and displayed in Forest-plots. Heterogeneity indexes were evaluated using I2 and Q. Sensitivity analysis and publication biases were also considered. Results: From 3006 records extracted, after removing duplicates and analyzing full texts we finally included 19 manuscripts involving a total of 1387 PsO cases and 6939 controls. PsO patients exhibited a substantial odds ratio (3.07, 95% CI: 1.56-6.04) for lower serum vitamin D levels compared to the control group. Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) of vitamin D in PsO versus controls was −0.92 (−1.33 to −0.51). Conclusion: Psoriatic patients displayed higher risk to have a vitamin D deficiency. Interventional studies to verify the preventive value are mandatory. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The term SMS (Short Message Service) refers to a popular text messaging service that is commonly used in telephone, internet, and mobile device systems. This service relies on standardized communication protocols that enable short text messages to be exchanged between mobile devices. The increase in SMS spam messages can be attributed to the higher limit of free SMS allowed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) SMS spam detection relies heavily on the presence of known words, phrases, abbreviations, and idioms commonly used in spam messages. Studies have developed various datasets to train and test SMS spam detection models and have used different classification techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. In the present study, various classification techniques for SMS spam detection have been explored such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. These techniques use different approaches to identify patterns and features in the messages that distinguish spam from legitimate messages. Among the various algorithms Naïve Bayes Classifier achieved a highest accuracy of 98.44% and Matthew Correlation Coefficients value of 0.93 for the dataset. © WCSE 2023.All rights reserved."
"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the primary surgical intervention for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with insufficient response to medication, significantly improving motor symptoms and quality of life. Despite FDA approval for over two decades, access to this therapy remains limited. This systematic review aims to evaluate the influence of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age on health disparities associated with DBS for PD, providing an overview of current research in this field. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane databases from 1960 to September 12th, 2023, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Studies that examine the disparities in accessing DBS among patients with PD were included, comparing different demographic factors. Findings were synthesized and presented narratively to identify and understand DBS disparities. Results: After screening for relevance, 25 studies published between 1960 and 2023 were included, with 16 studies meeting full-text review criteria. While reviewing the references of the 16 articles, two additional studies were included, bringing the total number of included studies to 18. Most studies originated from the United States (44%). The identified studies were categorized as identifying disparities, understanding disparities, or reducing disparities. The majority focused on identifying disparities (72%), while fewer studies delved into understanding the underlying factors (28%). No studies evaluated strategies for reducing disparities. The findings indicate that elderly, female, and Black people, as well as those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and developing countries face greater obstacles in accessing DBS for PD. Conclusion: This study highlights factors contributing to disparities in DBS utilization for PD, including race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Public health policymakers, practitioners, and clinicians should recognize these inequalities and work toward reducing disparities, particularly among vulnerable populations.

"A social and political psychology of citizenship can be furthered by the analysis of the values and representations through which citizenship is constructed in the text of laws and reconstructed during implementation and how these (re)constructions best serve some groups. This article views laws as facts from the reified/institutional universe whose texts operate a simplification process by prioritizing certain values from the plurality existent in the consensual universe and sees institutions in charge of law implementation as mediating systems operating re-complexification processes. Using this perspective, it (1) explores how the values and social representations prioritized in Portuguese foreign residency laws exclude/include certain groups and define rights and duties of “the good foreign resident/citizen”; (2) illustrates with interviews with experts from a mediating system (n = 6) the re-complexification of the laws in implementation. It highlights how the “worthiness” of foreign residents in Portugal depends upon three central values (work, study, and investment) keeping, however, some ambiguity of these values in the legal texts. Interviews illustrate how mediating systems re-signify the laws, amplifying the ambiguities by resorting to other values and representations. We discuss how the analysis of the dynamic relation between the reified and the consensual universes contributes to a better understanding of how macro-level factors interact with everyday citizenship. © 2023, PsychOpen.

"Contexte: L'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) est en plein essor, et l'arrivée en novembre 2022 de ChatGPT a accéléré cette tendance. Ce robot conversationnel permet de produire des articles scientifiques dans leur intégralité, pouvant donner lieu à du plagiat du fait de l'utilisation de données préalables, et potentiellement à des articles frauduleux car créés sans données scientifiques réelles. Des outils permettent de détecter l'IA dans les publications, mais à notre connaissance n'ont pas été évalués sur les publications d'une revue scientifique de manière systématique. Aussi une étude rétrospective a été menée sur des articles publiés dans Orthopaedics & Traumatology: Surgery & Research (OTSR) afin de: (1) rechercher la présence de texte généré par de l'IA avant et après la médiatisation à grande échelle de ChatGPT au sein d'articles publiés dans OTSR; (2) déterminer si l'IA était plus fréquemment utilisée dans certains pays pour générer des textes dans OTSR; (3) déterminer s'il existait une corrélation entre le taux de plagiat et la genèse d'un article par de l'IA; (4) préciser si des facteurs autres que les générateurs de textes pouvaient rendre un article suspect d'utilisation d'IA, notamment le procédé de traduction. Hypothèse: Le taux d'IA augmentait avec l'issue publique de la version 3.5 de ChatGPT en novembre 2022. Matériel et méthodes: Au total 425 publications (février 2022 à septembre 2023: 221 articles avant et 204 articles après 1/11/2022) ont vu leur taux d'IA mesuré par ZeroGPT sur la version finale de l'article en version anglaise (résumé et texte). Pour chaque article deux scores étaient obtenus: (i) un intitulé de probabilité (en 6 classes de humain à IA généré); (ii) un pourcentage de texte généré par de l'IA. Le taux de plagiat mesuré au moyen d'Ithenticate™ (Turnitin, Oakland, CA, États-Unis) lors de la soumission initiale de l'article était collecté. Des articles d'origine française ont été évalués en version anglaise traduits par un traducteur physique et comparés à des traductions obtenues par Google et DeepL. Résultats: Du texte généré par l'IA était détecté surtout pour les abstracts avec 10,1 % d'abstracts détectés comme IA ou majeure partie IA contre seulement 1,9 % pour le texte et 5,6 % pour la totalité texte + résumé. L'analyse avant et après novembre 2022 identifiait une présence accrue de texte généré par de IA pour les articles texte + résumé (passant de 10,30 ± 15,95 % [0–100] à 15,64 ± 19,8 % [0–99,93] [p < 0,04]) (NS pour les résumés isolés). Le taux d'IA était différent selon le type d'article: 14,9 % pour les articles originaux, 9,8 % pour les reviews (p < 0,01). Les taux les plus élevés de textes supposés générés par de l'IA étaient observés pour les articles issus du Japon, de Chine et d'Amérique du Sud et pour les pays anglophones (p < 0,0001). Les taux de plagiat n'ont pas progressé entre la période pré- ou post-novembre 2022 et étaient sans relation avec le taux d'IA. En revanche, en séparant les articles en « suspects » de genèse par de l'IA (taux ≥ 20 %) ou « non suspects » d'IA (taux < 20 %) le taux de similarité était plus élevé pour les articles « suspects d'IA » (25,7 ± 13,23 % [10–69]) versus les « non suspects » (16,28 ± 10 % [0–79]) (p < 0,001). Pour le corps du manuscrit, l'usage d'un logiciel de traduction augmentait le taux d'IA par rapport à une traduction par un traducteur physique professionnel passant de 3,5 ± 5 % par le traducteur physique à 18 ± 10 % et 21,9 ± 11 % respectivement pour Google et DeepL (p < 0,001). Discussion: Notre étude met en évidence une augmentation de l'occurrence de l'IA dans les articles publiés dans OTSR. Les taux d'IA étaient différents selon le type d'article et les pays d'origine. L'usage d'un logiciel de traduction augmente le taux d'IA. À terme l'utilisation de ChatGPT expose à un risque de plagiat et de méconduite scientifique et doit être détectée et prévenue par l'ajout d'un Tag numérique au texte généré par le robot.

"Psychological interventions provided via mobile, wireless technological communication devices (mHealth) are a promising method of healthcare delivery for young people. However, high attrition is increasingly recognised as a challenge to accurately interpreting and implementing the findings of mHealth trials. The present meta-analysis consolidates this research and investigates potential methodological, sociodemographic, and intervention moderators of attrition. A systematic search of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Embase was conducted. Study reporting quality was evaluated (QualSyst tool), and attrition rates (proportions) were calculated and pooled, using both random- and mixed-effects models. The pooled attrition rate, sourced from 15 independent samples (N participants = 1766), was 17% (CI [9.14, 30.13]). This increased to 26% (CI [15.20, 41.03]) when adjusting for publication bias. Attrition was significantly higher among application-based interventions (26%, CI [14.56, 41.86]) compared to those delivered via text or multimedia message (6%, CI [1.88, 16.98]). These data were, however, characterised by significant between-study variance. Attrition in mHealth trials with young people is common but may be mitigated by using message-based interventions. Taken together, the results can provide guidance in accounting for attrition across future mHealth research, clinical practice, public policy, and intervention design. However, sustained research focus on the effectiveness of different engagement strategies is needed to realise mHealth’s promise of equitable and efficient healthcare access for young people globally. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background: Latent disease classification is currently the accepted approach to mental illness diagnosis. In the United States, this takes the form of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5-Text Revision (DSM-5-TR). Latent disease classification has been criticized for reliability and validity problems, particularly regarding diagnostic heterogeneity. No authors have calculated the scope of the heterogeneity problem of the entire DSM-5-TR. Aims: We addressed this issue by calculating the unique diagnostic profiles that exist for every DSM-5-TR diagnosis. Methods: We did this by applying formulas previously used in smaller heterogeneity analyses to all diagnoses within the DSM-5-TR. Results: We found that there are 10,130,814 ways to be diagnosed with a mental illness using DSM-5-TR criteria. When specifiers are considered, this number balloons to over 161 septillion unique diagnostic presentations (driven mainly by bipolar II disorder). Additionally, there are 1,951,065 ways to present with psychiatric symptoms, yet not meet diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Latent disease classification leads to considerable heterogeneity in possible presentations. We provide examples of how latent disease classification harms research and treatment programs. We echo recommendations for the dismissal of latent disease classification as a mental illness diagnostic program. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This article presents an overview of Kazakh literary criticism dedicated to the works of Anton Chekhov. The first attempt is made to systematize the Kazakh literary-critical and artistic reception of Chekhov’s oeuvre in order to identify the main directions of the scientific and artistic comprehension of the creative heritage of the writer and playwright in Kazakh literary criticism. The authors reviewed Kazakh scholars’ studies on Chekhov, due to which different research strategies were revealed in Kazakh Chekhov studies. The relevance of this research lies in the study of receptive aesthetics, intercultural communication and dialogue between Kazakh and Russian cultures. The novelty of the work is in the first attempt of a special research of history and specificity of literary-critical and artistic reception of Chekhov’s works in Kazakhstan, as well as the first attempt of systematization of studies on Chekhov’s works by Kazakhstani researchers. Currently there is no work containing a detailed comprehensive analysis of the reception of Chekhov’s oeuvre in Kazakhstan. The aim of the work is to identify main directions of literary-critical and creative comprehension of Chekhov’s artistic heritage in Kazakh literary studies. In the course of the research we discovered that Kazakh literary-critical and artistic reception of Chekhov’s works is represented by a large number of studies. The interest of Kazakh researchers is aimed at studying the creative heritage of the author. Kazakh literary criticism is focused on an in-depth analysis of the literary text, on different levels of its organization, as well as on the peculiarities and difficulties of its translation into Kazakh. Due to the diversity of research topics, Kazakh Chekhov studies have revealed research strategies that differ from each other. The difference in the thematic approach of Kazakh literary critics to the study of Chekhov’s works is clearly evident. Kazakhstani literary critics mostly leave the biographical aspect of the reception out of their attention. Until now there have been no studies dedicated specifically to Chekhov’s biography in Kazakhstan. We can assume that this topic has been comprehensively studied in Russian literary criticism, and Kazakh researchers can freely refer to Russian researchers’ works due to their knowledge of the Russian language. The majority of studies on Chekhov in Kazakhstan are in the form of scholarly articles, dissertations and monographs. Chekhov’s works are studied in Kazakhstani schools; information about the author can be found in textbooks on Russian literature; however, no separate book dedicated to Chekhov has been published in Kazakhstan. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"Learning effective feature spaces for KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) classifiers is critical for their performance. Existing KNN loss functions designed to optimize CNNs in Rn feature spaces for specific KNN classifiers greatly boost the performance. However, these loss functions need to compute the pairwise distances within each batch, which requires large computational resource, GPU and memory. This paper aims to exploit lightweight KNN loss functions in order to reduce the computational cost while achieving comparable to or even better performance than existing KNN loss functions. To this end, an anchor loss function is proposed that assigns each category an anchor vector in KNN feature spaces and introduces the distances between training samples and anchor vectors in the NCA (Neighborhood Component Analysis) function. The proposed anchor loss function largely reduces the required computation by existing KNN loss functions. In addition, instead of optimizing CNNs in Rn feature spaces, this paper proposed to optimize them in hypersphere feature spaces for faster convergence and better performance. The proposed anchor loss optimized in the hypersphere feature space is called HAL (Hypersphere Anchor Loss). Experiments on various image classification benchmarks show that HAL reduces the computational cost and achieves better performance: on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets, compared with existing KNN loss functions, HAL improves the accuracy by over 1 % , and the computational cost decreases to less than 10 % . © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"In a randomized trial that collects text as an outcome, traditional approaches for assessing treatment impact require that each document first be manually coded for constructs of interest by human raters. An impact analysis can then be conducted to compare treatment and control groups, using the hand-coded scores as a measured outcome. This process is both time and labor-intensive, which creates a persistent barrier for large-scale assessments of text. Furthermore, enriching one’s understanding of a found impact on text outcomes via secondary analyses can be difficult without additional scoring efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide a pipeline for using machine-based text analytic and data mining tools to augment traditional text-based impact analysis by analyzing impacts across an array of automatically generated text features. In this way, we can explore what an overall impact signifies in terms of how the text has evolved due to treatment. Through a case study based on a recent field trial in education, we show that machine learning can indeed enrich experimental evaluations of text by providing a more comprehensive and fine-grained picture of the mechanisms that lead to stronger argumentative writing in a first- and second-grade content literacy intervention. Relying exclusively on human scoring, by contrast, is a lost opportunity. Overall, the workflow and analytical strategy we describe can serve as a template for researchers interested in performing their own experimental evaluations of text. © 2023 AERA."
"Introduction: In 2016 diplomatic personnel serving in Havana, Cuba, began reporting audible sensory phenomena paired with onset of complex and persistent neurological symptoms consistent with brain injury. The etiology of these Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI) and subsequent symptoms remains unknown. This report investigates putative exposure-symptom pathology by assembling a network model of published bio-behavioral pathways and assessing how dysregulation of such pathways might explain loss of function in these subjects using data available in the published literature. Given similarities in presentation with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we used the latter as a clinically relevant means of evaluating if the neuropsychological profiles observed in Havana Syndrome Havana Syndrome might be explained at least in part by a dysregulation of neurotransmission, neuro-inflammation, or both. Method: Automated text-mining of >9,000 publications produced a network consisting of 273 documented regulatory interactions linking 29 neuro-chemical markers with 9 neuropsychological constructs from the Brief Mood Survey, PTSD Checklist, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Analysis of information flow through this network produced a set of regulatory rules reconciling to within a 6% departure known mechanistic pathways with neuropsychological profiles in N = 6 subjects. Results: Predicted expression of neuro-chemical markers that jointly satisfy documented pathways and observed symptom profiles display characteristically elevated IL-1B, IL-10, NGF, and norepinephrine levels in the context of depressed BDNF, GDNF, IGF1, and glutamate expression (FDR < 5%). Elevations in CRH and IL-6 were also predicted unanimously across all subjects. Furthermore, simulations of neurological regulatory dynamics reveal subjects do not appear to be “locked in” persistent illness but rather appear to be engaged in a slow recovery trajectory. Discussion: This computational analysis of measured neuropsychological symptoms in Havana-based diplomats proposes that these AHI symptoms may be supported in part by disruption of known neuroimmune and neurotransmission regulatory mechanisms also associated with mTBI.

"Introduction: Setting sodium targets for pre-packaged food has been a priority strategy for reducing population sodium intake. This study aims to explore the attitudes and considerations of researchers and key stakeholders toward implementing such policy in China. Methods: An exploratory study comprising a survey and a focus group discussion was conducted among 27 purposively selected participants including 12 researchers, 5 consumers, 4 administrators, 3 industry association representatives and 3 food producers. The survey/discussion covered the key questions considered when developing/promoting sodium targets. Free-text responses were manually classified and summarized using thematic analysis. Results: Two-thirds of the participants supported target-setting policy. Researchers and administrators were most supportive, and food producers and associations were least supportive. Adapted WHO food categorization framework was well accepted to underpin target-setting to ensure international comparability and applicability for Chinese products. Maximum values were the most agreed target type. The WHO benchmarks were thought to be too ambitious to be feasible given the current food supply in China but can be regarded as long-term goals. Initially, a reduction of sodium content by 20% was mostly accepted to guide the development of maximum targets. Other recommendations included implementing a comprehensive strategy, strengthening research, engaging social resources, establishing a systematic monitoring/incentive system, maintaining a fair competitive environment, and developing a supportive information system. Target-setting policy was acceptable by most stakeholders and should be implemented alongside strategies to reduce discretionary salt use. Discussion: Our findings provide detailed guidance for the Chinese government when developing a target-setting strategy. The methods and results of this study also provide meaningful references for other countries to set sodium targets for pre-packaged foods and implement other salt reduction strategies simultaneously.

"Objective: Obesity and excess adiposity are leading causes of metabolic and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early identification of individuals at risk is key for preventive strategies. We examined the relationship between infant body composition (0-2 years of age) and later (>2 years) health outcomes using a systematic review. Design: We preregistered the study on PROSPERO (ID 288013) and searched Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases for English language publications using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms € infant' and € body composition' and € risk' between January 1946 and February 2022. We included studies which assessed infant body composition using predetermined in vivo methods other than body mass index (BMI). Results: We identified 6015 articles. After abstract screening to assess eligibility, we reviewed 130 full text publications. 30 were included in the final assessment and narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of results. All 30 studies were of high quality and reported associations between infant body composition and 19 different health outcomes after 2 years of age. Outcome measurements ranged from 2 years to 16 years. The strongest associations were found between infant fat mass and later fat mass (7 studies), and later BMI (5 studies). For 11 of the outcomes assessed, there was no relationship to infant adiposity detected. Conclusions: Current evidence, from a small number of studies, suggests a positive association between infant adiposity and future adiposity or BMI, but the validity of infant body composition as a biomarker of future health remains inconclusive. Carefully designed, standardised studies are required to identify the value of infant body composition for predicting later health.

"Important theoretical developments in TESOL education challenge the monolingual mindset, instead valuing and leveraging students' complex linguistic repertoires alongside their funds of knowledge and identity through translanguaging practices to foster literacy development. Through a case study of an arts-rich book making experience facilitated by community organization, Kids' Own Publishing, this article uses assemblage thinking to examine how children's semiotic, knowledge, and identity resources interact to support them to create and sustain meaning making flow and to express distinctive authorial voices. Employing a critical content analysis guided by assemblage thinking, we highlight the literacy skills demonstrated in five students' published eight-page books and show how the interaction of children's meaning-making resources is best understood through an “assemblage” lens, a process which is under-researched. Through this lens, we examine the facilitative role of the arts-rich experience in furnishing vibrant activities, artifacts, and an inspiring physical space that shaped how the children's meaning-making resources came together as flows. We consider implications for literacy learning, including the need to create conditions for all children's meaning making resources to be drawn upon in text creation in an approach that values what all students, whether they identify as monolingual or multilingual, bring to their learning. © 2023 The Authors.

"The Ecstasy of St. Teresa is arguably the most controversial work created by the Roman Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680). The debate surrounding the statue centers on the question: did the artist’s radically non-traditional depiction of Teresa’s transverberation transgress the boundaries of decorum as understood by seventeenth-century Catholicism? This debate has lasted for many years and is likely to endure for many more to come, for, as the mass of, at times, contradictory documentation leads us to conclude, the line of decorum that Bernini did, or did not, cross would seem to resist any firm pinpointing, that is was, indeed, fluid and subjective, even when seen through seventeenth-century eyes. The aim of this article is not to deny the subjective fluidity of that line of decorum, but rather to propose that it was perhaps far less fluid and subjective than some examiners of the issue today seem inclined to believe. At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, its aim is also to disabuse the staunch defenders of Bernini’s decorum of the belief that no matter where that line of decorum might have been located in the seventeenth century, there cannot possibly be any reasonable grounds for suggesting that Bernini may have crossed it. Defenses of Bernini’s decorum rest on three claims: (1) Bernini faithfully followed the literal description of Teresa’s transverberation as described by the saint herself; (2) the Church understood that mystical union often entailed erotic elements and thus had no problem with religious art depicting that reality; and (3) since there is no nudity in Bernini’s statue, it cannot be accused of violating decorum. Through detailed analysis of Roman Catholic catechetical teaching (from Augustine to Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino), Teresa’s writings and other primary texts relating to the saint’s transverberation, and an extremely close examination of the statue itself, this article argues that none of these defenses is completely accurate and thus unassailable in its conclusion, while, however, not claiming to resolve the decorum debate once and for all. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on blood transfusion and collection. At the beginning of the pandemic, most blood transfusion services had a tough challenge in maintaining an optimal blood inventory. Objective: This study aims to understand the public's psychological cognition and intention toward blood donation as well as the factors influencing their worries. We aimed to find a solution for increasing blood donations and provide a scientific reference for policy formulation regarding blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future. Methods: A random survey with a 14-item scale on worries related to blood donation was conducted from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 2023, among residents aged 18-60 years in Zhejiang province via SMS text messaging. The results of 8 worry items in this study were compared with the survey results of March 2022, during which COVID-19 was not considered as an epidemic in Zhejiang province. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed to analyze the factors affecting respondents’ blood donation intention and concerns. The degree of worry about blood donation was assigned from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), and 2-sided t tests were performed to analyze the differences in blood donation intention and worries about blood donation. Results: In total, 1254 valid questionnaire responses were obtained. Males accounted for 62.36% (782/1254) of the sample, 78.39% (983/1254) were 18-45 years old, 60.61% (760/1254) had a university education, and 69.06% (866/1254) had no previous blood donation experience. Approximately 36.52% (458/1254) of the public clearly expressed that they had blood donation worries regarding COVID-19. The main concerns of the respondents were temporary physical weakness caused by blood donation, their own physical conditions not meeting the requirements of blood donation, inconvenient location and working hours for blood donation, and family (or friends) worrying about blood donation. Compared with the results in 2022, the results in 2023 regarding the harmful effects of blood donation on health, temporary physical weakness, infection in donated blood, and family (friends) worrying increased significantly (P<.001). The factors influencing blood donation worries regarding COVID-19 were COVID-19 infection status, adverse reactions to the donated blood, family (or friends) worrying, and unsatisfactory blood donation experience. The factors influencing blood donation intention were gender, age, previous blood donation times, blood donation worries regarding COVID-19, harmful effects of blood donation on health, and blood donation anxiety. Conclusions: Blood transfusion services should make full use of the recovery phase of COVID-19 infection as an important time point, publicize the blood donation process and operation standardization, reduce the public's concerns about blood donation, correct negative evaluations, and increase perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. ©Qiuyue Hu, Wei Hu, Lingling Pan, Wenjuan Han, Yue Zheng."
"This paper explores the natural language processing technology of news text, especially the algorithm and application of title generation and abstraction. Based on the analysis of the existing principle of automatic title generation and abstraction, the data sets are preprocessed by text cleaning and word quantization according to the objective and accurate features of news text. Then, the Roberta, GPT-2, and T5-pegasus models were evaluated, and the method of model fusion and integration based on the principle of accuracy priority was proposed to improve the accuracy of title generation by 3%. Finally, the news text processing system is constructed based on the optimized model. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high reliability and robustness. This topic has been applied, and the application shows that the results of the news text processing system are accurate and objective, and have high adaptability. © 2023 SPIE."
"Hate speech is any act of provoking or insulting another person or group based on their ethnicity, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability, or other characteristics. This can be done in a variety of ways. Because of this, a study was conducted that focused on ascertaining the most effective technique for identifying hate speech. It was discovered that LSTM, a form of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly good at modeling sequential data, is the most successful technique to apply. Many natural language processing (NLP) activities may be performed with it, including hate speech detection, which makes LSTM have advantages over other techniques, both in terms of long-term memory mechanisms. LSTM, also able to handle long and complex text sequences, capable of recognizing more complex patterns, able to understand and consider the context in the text, to recognize the meaning of a word or phrase in a broader context. Then, based on the dataset obtained from the Kaggle website with a total of 24783 data, then the dataset is divided into training data and validation data, with a ratio of training data to validation data. of 80%: 20%.

"Article title: Frequency Transform Method for Transient Analysis of Nuclear Reactors in Monte Carlo Authors: Miriam A. Kreher, Samuel Shaner, Benoit Forget, Kord Smith Journal: Nuclear Science and EngineeringBibliometrics: Volume 197, Number 2, pages 279–290 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/00295639.2022.2067739 The frequency transform derivation and code has been rigorously tested since the publication of this paper, and the diffusion solver contained a small error in the calculation of the diffusion coefficients in the code. However, since the role of nonlinear diffusion coefficients is to force balance between coarse mesh finite difference and Monte Carlo, they compensated for this error, resulting in an insignificant impact on the final results. The values of the nonlinear diffusion coefficients are, nonetheless, affected. Therefore, the analysis on diffusion coefficients in Sec. III.C of this work is erroneous and has been rewritten and supplemented by an analysis of how other multigroup parameters evolve during the transient (see the online version of this article for the updated text and figures). © 2023 American Nuclear Society."
"In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of rural living environment improvements and upgrading mechanisms. Our results are conducive to consolidating and expanding the results of the 3-year action plan focused on comprehensively promoting the improvement in rural living environments in the new development stage. Based on the policy theme–effectiveness assessment–improvement path research framework, we analyzed the effectiveness of rural living environment improvements in Chongqing with the help of policy text analysis and structural equation modeling, explaining the mechanisms and proposing the pathways for these improvements, taking the policy theme as our guide and the six projects as the focus. The results showed that the rural living improvement in Chongqing focused on five major themes:infrastructure, economic development, living conditions, public services, and industrial development, with the number of relevant documents accounting for 18.9%, 16.3%, 19.8%, 25.6%, and 19.4%, respectively, of the total. From 1997 to 2020, the literature content showed phases in its characteristics from element supply, to structural improvement, to functional enhancement. The remediationeffectiveness was higher in the main urban area, followed by in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, then the Wuling Mountains area, with comprehensive values of 2.70, 2.42, and 2.41, respectively. The effectiveness of housing remediation was highest in the first- and secondclass areas, whereas the effectiveness of biological resources recycling and regional culture remediation was higher in the third-class areas. The rural living environment improvement projects interacted with and promoted each other, and infrastructure development strongly contributed to the advancement of other projects. Therefore, the relevant departments should establish a systematic working idea for focusing on the goals, simultaneously implementing multiple measures, and coordinating governance to improve the quality of the rural living environment. © 2023, Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

"Objective: Whole person health care, like that being implemented in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA), involves person-centered approaches that address what matters most to patients to achieve well-being beyond the biomedical absence of disease. As whole health (WH) approaches expand, their integration into clinical practice is predicated on health care employees reconceptualizing practice beyond find-it-fix-it medicine and embracing WH as a new philosophy of care. This study examined employee perspectives of WH and their integration of this approach into care. Design: We conducted a survey with responses from 1073 clinical and 800 nonclinical employees at 5 VHA WH Flagship sites about their perceptions and use of a WH approach. We used descriptive statistics to examine employees’ support for WH and conducted thematic analysis to qualitatively explore their perceptions about this approach from free-text comments supplied by 475 respondents. Results: On structured survey items, employees largely agreed that WH was a valuable approach but were relatively less likely to have incorporated it into practice or report support within their organization for WH. Qualitative comments revealed varying conceptualizations of WH. While some respondents understood that WH represented a philosophical shift in care, many characterized WH narrowly as services. These conceptualizations contributed to lower perceived relevance, skepticism, and misgivings that WH diverted needed resources away from existing clinical services. Organizational context including leadership messaging, siloed structures, and limited educational opportunities reinforced these perceptions. Conclusions: Successfully transforming the culture of care requires a shift in mindset among employees and leadership alike. Employees’ depictions didn’t always reflect WH as a person-centered approach designed to engage patients to enhance their health and well-being. Without consistent leadership messaging and accessible training, opportunities to expand understandings of WH are likely to be missed. To promote WH transformation, additional attention is needed for employees to embrace this approach to care. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
"Social media platforms have become a new source of useful information for companies. Ensuring the business value of social media first requires an analysis of the quality of the relevant data and then the development of practical business intelligence solutions. This paper aims at building high-quality datasets for social business intelligence (SoBI). The proposed method offers an integrated and dynamic approach to identify the relevant quality metrics for each analysis domain. This method employs a novel multidimensional data model for the construction of cubes with impact measures for various quality metrics. In this model, quality metrics and indicators are organized in two main axes. The first one concerns the kind of facts to be extracted, namely: posts, users, and topics. The second axis refers to the quality perspectives to be assessed, namely: credibility, reputation, usefulness, and completeness. Additionally, quality cubes include a user-role dimension so that quality metrics can be evaluated in terms of the user business roles. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, the authors have applied their method to two separate domains: automotive business and natural disasters management. Results show that the trade-off between quantity and quality for social media data is focused on a small percentage of relevant users. Thus, data filtering can be easily performed by simply ranking the posts according to the quality metrics identified with the proposed method. As far as the authors know, this is the first approach that integrates both the extraction of analytical facts and the assessment of social media data quality in the same framework. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into oncology promises a revolution in diagnosis, treatment, and research. Various applications are considered, with a focus on stress and burnout experienced by oncologists. The potentials are comprehensively discussed, starting from prevention through wearables and AI-assisted analysis of health data to personalized treatment planning and accelerated drug development. One area of focus is AlphaFold, an AI application for protein folding. The management of patient data and the creation of medical reports are optimized by AI, with search engines and large language models (LLM) playing a prominent role. The increasing specialization of LLMs, particularly in medical text generation, underscores their growing importance. The feasibility of AI applications is emphasized, addressing the need for resources and training for medical personnel. Commercial organizations, such as DeepMind, play a crucial role in implementing AI in clinical practice. Regulatory challenges are discussed, including data privacy, quality control, liability, and ethical aspects. The European Health Data Space (EHDS) is a promising initiative for promoting secure data exchange within the European Union. Overall, AI can facilitate significant advancements in oncology. However, regulatory challenges require careful attention to ensure an ethically responsible and safe implementation. AI applications have the potential to improve cancer care, revolutionize patient management, and reduce the workload for medical personnel. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background & Study Aim: The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, which has spread worldwide, started in December 2019, with confirmed cases continuing to occur in 2022. As of July 7, 2022, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases was about 500 million, and the death toll was about 6.34 million. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and labelled it the highest level of infectious disease risk. The purpose of this study was knowledge both about likely changes facing athletes in Korea owing to the spread of COVID-19 and how they are coping with these – specifically taekwondo kyorugi athletes. Material & Methods: A qualitative approach was chosen – an open-ended questionnaire was designed comprising four demographic questions and two questions addressing the impact of COVID-19 and coping methods. Questionnaire data from 184 adult taekwondo athletes were collected. For the text analysis, the latent Dirichlet allocation topic modelling algorithm was applied, and the coherence score index was used to select the number of topics. All data processing was performed using Python 3. Results: From the coherence scores, three topics were identified under COVID-19 impacts and two under coping, as most suitable. The derived topics based on keyword distribution probabilities and the topic modelling analysis were as follows: first, the key impacts on the taekwondo athletes caused by COVID-19 were confirmed as anxiety due to training restrictions, self-care due to game postponement, and career instability due to game cancellation; second, the taekwondo athletes coped with COVID-19 by maintaining their performance through personal training and preparing for matches through personal quarantine Conclusions: In the event of a similar situation in the future, new ways need to be identified that allow for training as well as competition during a pandemic. Additionally, preliminary efforts should focus on how to minimize anxiety among athletes whose careers and livelihoods are tied to their sport. © 2023, the Authors."
"Purpose: Retained foreign objects (RFOs) can place patients undergoing cataract surgery at risk for significant vision-threatening complications. In this systematic review, we examine the characteristics, clinical outcomes, and management of RFOs originating from surgical instruments or the surgical field after routine cataract surgery. Methods: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched five databases in June 2023. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed, full-text, English-language articles describing RFOs after routine cataract surgery. Studies that described non-routine cataract surgeries, patients with a history of ocular trauma, or organic RFOs were excluded. Two investigators independently extracted data and appraised the methodological quality of each study using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in our qualitative synthesis describing metal, fiber, and plastic RFOs. Typically, the RFOs were detected during surgery or slit-lamp examination. Presentations of patients with metal or fiber RFOs varied, with some being asymptomatic. Patients with plastic RFOs were usually symptomatic, often with decreased visual acuity and/or anterior chamber inflammation. Metal RFOs may have originated from metal fatigue from prolonged instrument usage and contact between surgical instruments, fiber RFOs from surgical wipes and gauzes, and plastic RFOs from instrument wrapping and intraocular lens defects. Factors such as location, biocompatibility, and secondary intraocular inflammation influenced the decision to surgically remove RFOs. Following surgical removal, the signs and symptoms resolved in most patients with RFOs. The studies’ GRADE ratings indicated limitations in risk of bias and imprecision. Conclusion: The presentation and management of RFOs varied depending on the type of material. To prevent RFOs, clinicians should carefully inspect surgical instruments and packs and use fiber-free wipes, towels, and gauzes. Future studies should investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different RFO prevention strategies. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."
"The analysis of constitutional interpretation has received much attention in recent years. This article is a contribution to research using text mining methods to account for markers of constitutional reasoning in big data-sized text corpora. We examine how often the Hungarian Constitutional Court (the HCC) reflected on the various methods of interpretation. For this purpose, we have created a com-plex corpus covering all HCC decisions and orders between 1990 and 2021. We found evidence that the methodological practice of the HCC is not self-reflexive in general as only 44% of its decisions make a reference to at least one method of interpretation. We also show that the self-reflexive nature is even more prevalent (in fact, ubiquitous) in 100 doctrinally important decisions from the 30 years of jurisprudence in question. While this study is a first step towards the quantitative analysis of the reasoning of the constitutional judiciary, further mixed methods research is needed to account for intertemporal changes in such data and to refine the measurement of constitutional interpretation. © 2023, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sklodowskiej w Lublinie.

"In this article, the author demonstrates how one can use large-scale and publicly available online review data to study the rise in anxiety in the United States. Using the anxiety keyword list from the dictionary compiled by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, the author analyzed the text of approximately 7 million online reviews submitted by Yelp reviewers across 13 U.S. states from 2006 to 2021. The overall pattern confirms existing discourse that anxiety has been constantly rising in Western societies since 2000. Beyond documenting the overall pattern, online review data enable the disaggregation of this pattern by geographies, price levels, and individuals, thereby providing a more comprehensive and detailed picture than previously documented in existing literature. Additional analysis shows that anxiety is increasing faster than other emotions, such as anger and sadness. © The Author(s) 2023."

A corresponding binomial test reveals that the 14 dead in the placebo group are significantly different from prognosticated 25 deaths, at a p-value of 0.0012. Hence, counting just 14 dead in Thomas et al. (7) is already utterly unlikely to be explainable by chance; and the 4 dead reported in Polack et al. (1) are an entirely impossible count, which can only reflect some preliminary data analysis. In stark disaccord, the data reported in Polack et al. (1) should without doubt stand on their own and not rely on additional publications, as this was a public dissemination of both safety and efficacy probed by a pivotal vaccine trial. Publishing another, later (6-month) safety data set as in Thomas et al. (7), or even secondary reports like, e.g., by the USA's “Food and Drug Administration,” should not be required when disseminating a primary endpoint assessment of safety (mortality).” The corrected sentence appears below: “In continuation of Polack et al.

"Purpose: This is, to our knowledge, the first network meta-analysis aiming to compare all treatment modalities for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Methods: After the electronic databases were searched, two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, full-texts, and extracted information. Primary endpoints were change in visual outcome and central retinal thickness. We used a network meta-analysis to compare treatment outcomes in the early (≤ 6 months) and late (> 6 months) phase. Results: We included 34 studies (2,098 eyes) in our network meta-analysis. In the early phase, the use of anti-VEGF led to a gain of 14.1 letters (95% CI, 10.8–17.4) compared to untreated patients (p < 0.0001), 12.1 letters (95% CI, 8.3–15.8) to photodynamic therapy (PDT) (p < 0.0001), 7.5 (95% CI, 1.2–13.8) letters to intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) (p = 0.019), and − 2.9 letters (95% CI, − 6.0–0.2) to the combination of anti-VEGF and PDT (p = 0.065). In the later phase, these results were largely maintained. There were no significant differences in visual outcomes between patients treated with 1 + PRN and 3 + PRN. However, the 1 + PRN group received 1.8 (SD 1.3), while the 3 + PRN group received 3.2 (SD 0.9) injections within 12 months (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: This network meta-analysis confirms that anti-VEGF is the most effective treatment for myopic CNV using the 1 + PRN treatment strategy. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background: The issue of climate change has currently become a critical concern for the global community as it affects the transmission and spread of a wide range of diseases. This study aims to examine the literature and scientific evidence concerning the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases. Materials and Methods: In this review research, a comprehensive search and review of texts was conducted in various databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The MeSH framework was used as the search strategy for articles published from 2009 to 2022. Results: The results showed that weather and environmental factors can have positive or negative effects on the growth rate, mortality, and reproduction of vectors of infectious diseases. Climate changes also affect the transmission of diseases based on an unknown mechanism. In addition, weather crises, such as floods and droughts impact pathogens, vectors, and hosts of diseases. Accordingly, many vector-borne diseases have a high potential for vulnerability to climate and weather conditions because of various animal vectors and hosts. Conclusion: The prevalence and incidence of vector-borne diseases are affected by climate changes, especially parasitic diseases caused by mosquitoes, which are among the diseases sensitive to climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanism of the relationship between climate change and disease transmission. It is suggested to conduct studies to provide prediction models and temporal-spatial analysis of the impact of climate changes on infectious diseases and disease vectors. © 2023, Negah Institute for Scientific Communication.

"Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available published data related to rats about spermatogenesis to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of cigarette smoke exposure on the parameters of spermatogenesis.Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed, EBSCO, ProQuest, Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, Springer Link, GARUDA, and Google Scholar, spanning from their inception until January 29th, 2021, was conducted to retrieve relevant studies and full-text articles evaluating the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on the parameters of spermatogenesis in rats. Data were taken from eligible studies. We use SYRCLE’s Risk of Bias tool for this animal studies. The overall size effect was measured, and forest plots and funnel plots were generated using the statistical software JASP.Results: The present study comprised 23 studies involving 527 rats. The findings of this meta-analysis revealed that parameters of spermatogenesis, such as sperm count, morphology, and viability, were substantially impaired in response to conventional cigarette smoke exposure, exhibiting and aggregate correlation coefficient of 0,70 (95% CI:0.61-0.79, p <.001).Conclusion: Exposure to conventional cigarette smoke has a significant negative effect on spermatogenic parameters in rats, particularly in terms of sperm count, morphology, and viability. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The purpose of this paper is to create intelligibility about two literacy events in a public school in northeastern Brazil. The theoretical foundation is established in dialogic literacy, a concept emerging from the interface between the studies of critical literacy, social literacy and the dialogical conception of language. Through autoethnography, a qualitative research method, two events are described: protests by students and education professionals against the Proposed Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) of the Public Spending Ceiling in 2016 (currently Constitutional Amendment n. 95) and against the political intervention in their institution in 2020. The analysis is based on the discussion of the events in the light of the theoretical foundation, showing that it is possible to adopt practices of reading and writing texts at school in order to organize students for social transformation. © 2023 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

"Human adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (hASCs) are adult multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells with immunomodulatory capacities. Here, we present up-to-date knowledge on the impact of different experimental and donor-related factors on hASC immunoregulatory functions in vitro. The experimental determinants include the immunological status of hASCs relative to target immune cells, contact vs. contactless interaction, and oxygen tension. Factors such as the ratio of hASCs to immune cells, the cellular context, the immune cell activation status, and coculture duration are also discussed. Conditioning of hASCs with different approaches before interaction with immune cells, hASC culture in xenogenic or xenofree culture medium, hASC culture in two-dimension vs. three-dimension with biomaterials, and the hASC passage number are among the experimental parameters that greatly may impact the hASC immunosuppressive potential in vitro, thus, they are also considered. Moreover, the influence of donor-related characteristics such as age, sex, and health status on hASC immunomodulation in vitro is reviewed. By analysis of the literature studies, most of the indicated determinants have been investigated in broad non-standardized ranges, so the results are not univocal. Clear conclusions cannot be drawn for the fine-tuned scenarios of many important factors to set a standard hASC immunopotency assay. Such variability needs to be carefully considered in further standardized research. Importantly, field experts’ opinions may help to make it clearer. Graphical Abstract: Parameters that promote ASC immunosuppression on immune cells. Activation of immune cells induces their proliferation and differentiation and presence of ASCs modulates/suppresses such consequences. Augmented immunosuppressive effects of ASCs can be introduced in direct contact with the immune cells and via complementing the repeatedly reported experimental settings (texts in grey shapes).

"Contemporary inclusive values, which permeate European and Croatian educational documents and curricula, aim to ensure fair and equal opportunities for the development of every student, regardless of their educational needs and cultural, ethnic, linguistic and socioeconomic origin, and the representation, realistic portrayal, and acceptance of social differences in teaching materials has been emphasized as a powerful tool for overcoming discrimination, stigmatization, and marginalization of the most vulnerable groups in society. Therefore, it is vital that school textbooks contain inclusive content. The aim of this research was to investigate the representation and portrayal of people with disabilities in the English language textbooks published by Profil-Klett (New Building Blocks 1, New Building Blocks 2, New Building Blocks 3, New Building Blocks 4) intended for teaching in the first four grades of primary school and whether the representation of a particular type of disability in the analyzed textbooks corresponds to the actual share of people with disabilities in the Republic of Croatia. The research was conducted in two phases using the method of content analysis. The first and second research phases involved reading each textbook page and analyzing images (photos and illustrations) and text related to disability or people with disabilities. The coding system was based on an adapted form of English textbook research conducted by Gulya and Fehérvári (2023.). The obtained results indicate the need to raise awareness about the inclusion of content related to disabilities and people with disabilities in the analyzed school textbooks, given that the current teaching contents contain references only to visual impairments (primarily in adults) but not other categories of disability. © 2023, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine.

"Owing to social structures that promote different types of connections, including investments and vertical relationships, boards of directors of international large companies often have some directors in sharing. Managing these complex relationships is very relevant both in terms of Human Resource Management (HRM) and knowledge management. Investors’ knowledge is usually influenced by the news on interlocked directors and this thus affects financial market trends. Using an event-study methodology, this paper aims to investigate whether newspaper articles (1999–2013) mentioning CEOs and Chairmen affiliated to multiple organisations influence the stock market prices of the companies where they are appointed. Results highlight that when directors serve two different companies, they work as a transmission channel in influencing investors’ knowledge and behaviour through media. Moreover, we find a stronger effect of indirect news over direct news which outlines that investors find highly informative the names of boards’ leaders even when not directly associated to the firm.

"The analysis of the discourse of systemic transformation in the 90s of the twentieth century in Russia was carried out on the basis of the source text entitled Intelligence on the ruins of the homeland (1996) by the conservative publicist Sergei Kara-Murza. The analysis began with the clarification of the concept of the system, its component parts, the mechanism of maintaining functional balance and the time frame of transformation. The conclusions of the analysis allowed us to build the model of the system. The model enables a researcher to trace the inconsistencies that consist in loosening the relationship between the fundamental parts of a system – values. The words that are characterized by ambivalence made the second layer of systemic analysis. The question of their semantics reveals the direction of transformation of the system – towards an increase in functional balance or towards its disturbance. The question about the role of intelligence boils down to its competence in recognizing the nuances of meaning and building such models of the system that will show the potential dangers of clashing values before the postulates are implemented in practice. In this aspect, the system model, on the basis of which the course of the system transformation can be forecasted, has a diagnostic and prognostic functions. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved."
"Generative text-to-image models have gained great popularity among the public for their powerful capability to generate high-quality images based on natural language prompts. However, developing effective prompts for desired images can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. This research proposes PromptMagician, a visual analysis system that helps users explore the image results and refine the input prompts. The backbone of our system is a prompt recommendation model that takes user prompts as input, retrieves similar prompt-image pairs from DiffusionDB, and identifies special (important and relevant) prompt keywords. To facilitate interactive prompt refinement, PromptMagician introduces a multi-level visualization for the cross-modal embedding of the retrieved images and recommended keywords, and supports users in specifying multiple criteria for personalized exploration. Two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system, suggesting it facilitates prompt engineering and improves the creativity support of the generative text-to-image model.

"Climate change is becoming an increasingly urgent issue. To encourage firms to include climate-related risk information in regular financial reports, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has developed a report format that provides detailed description of the risks and opportunities that enterprises will face due to climate change. Such information is of great concern for consumers, investors and regulators. However, manually accessing this information through individual financial reports is time-consuming. This research uses pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and ClimateBERT to automate the detection and analysis of TCFD-related texts. The generative adversarial network (GAN) model is used to generate data with fewer labels, thereby improving classification performance as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The detected texts are analyzed using explainable AI (XAI) to confirm which the text variables that will affect whether the paragraphs reflect internal support for climate change remediation efforts or lack of such support. In addition, the relationship between these variables and the final prediction results can be understood through the intensity value provided by XAI which reflects the degree of influence of each feature on the model detection results. The results show that the ClimateBERT model achieves a prediction accuracy rate of 90%, thus potentially helping consumers and investors better access important information to their consumption and investment decisions.

"This paper contributes to the understanding of the value base of smallholder farmers' relationships with their environment. It aims to identify and analyze Tanzanian smallholder farmers’ attitudes toward nature. The field was approached with a combined method, a content analysis of a body of literature and a qualitative study consisting of questionnaires and interviews with smallholder farmers as well as their representatives. The literature analysis revealed three different types of evaluative attitudes toward nature in texts representing smallholder farmers’ opinions and values, and the issues affecting them. These include the Human benefit type, the Sustainable society type, and the Harmony type. The results show that there is a discrepancy among the literature analysis, the answers of smallholder farmers, and those of their representatives. The Harmony type is not mentioned in the answers of the smallholder farmers themselves and is only marginally in those of their representatives but is present in the literature. This finding is discussed from the perspective of the rights of nature as an entry point. Additionally, possible reasons for Tanzanian NGOs to include ‘foreign’ ideas, such as the Harmony type, in their agendas are discussed. Since Tanzanian smallholder farmers' evaluative attitudes toward nature are best represented by the Sustainable society type, policy strategies that support agroecology could be used to give them the mental and physical space of opportunity they need. © 2023 The Author"
"Despite the high level of development of audiovisual translation technologies, the direct process of translation and adaptation of verbal content is based on the professional competencies of the translator, among which the ability to carry out transcreational translation plays a significant role. The purpose of this paper is to explore the strategy of transcreation in the audiovisual translation of the film into the Russian language. The relevance of the study is determined by the global scale of film-making industry and the key role of strategies aimed at creative transformation of film texts in the process of audiovisual translation. The correlation between the concepts of localization and transcreation is also of high importance in the present paper. The comparative analysis of original version, Russian subtitles and the dubbed Russian version of the film under study has allowed pointing out the opposition “formal equivalence:: dynamic equivalence” and revealing the effectiveness of using the transcreation strategy in the dubbing process. © Siberian Federal University.

"Despite significant research on the techniques of repression employed by medieval inquisitors against religious dissidents, the case-level influences on the penances they meted out are understood only vaguely: the extent to which sentencing “systems” existed is unknown. To overcome this, we apply formal methods–an exploratory analysis supported by crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, and statistical modeling founded on multiple linear regression–to the large and historically significant register of Peter Seila (1241–2), captured as structured data via a statement-based approach entitled “Computer-Assisted Semantic Text Modelling” (CASTEMO). The results show that Peter systematically weighted different types of crimes and dissident interactions when sentencing; they do not suggest, however, that he was influenced by accomplicity or kinship among the sentenced. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The microservice architecture breaks through the traditional cluster architecture mode based on virtual machines and uses containers as carriers to interact through lightweight communication mechanisms to reduce system coupling and provide more flexible system service support. With the expansion of the system scale, a large number of system logs with complex structures and chaotic relationships are generated. How to accurately analyze the system logs and make efficient fault prediction is particularly important for building a safe and reliable system. By studying neural network technology, this paper proposes an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM). Combined with the dual channel convolutional neural network model (DCNN), it uses the attention mechanism to explore the differences between dimensional features, realizes multi-dimensional feature fusion, and establishes a BiLSTM-DCNN deep learning model that integrates the attention mechanism. From the perspective of social network analysis, a data preprocessing method is proposed to process fault redundant data and improve the accuracy of fault prediction under Microservices. Compare BiLSTM-DCNN with the mainstream system log analysis machine learning models SVM, CNN and Bi-LSTM, and explore the advantages of BiLSTM-DCNN in processing microservice system log text. The model is applied to simulation data and HDFS data set for experimental comparison, which proves the good generalization ability and universality of BiLSTM-DCNN.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd."
"Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is soaring, and the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 has accelerated this trend. This “chatbot” can generate complete scientific articles, with risk of plagiarism by mining existing data or downright fraud by fabricating studies with no real data at all. There are tools that detect AI in publications, but to our knowledge they have not been systematically assessed for publication in scientific journals. We therefore conducted a retrospective study on articles published in Orthopaedics & Traumatology: Surgery & Research (OTSR): firstly, to screen for AI-generated content before and after the publicized launch of ChatGPT; secondly, to assess whether AI was more often used in some countries than others to generate content; thirdly, to determine whether plagiarism rate correlated with AI-generation, and lastly, to determine whether elements other than text generation, and notably the translation procedure, could raise suspicion of AI use. Hypothesis: The rate of AI use increased after the publicized launch of ChatGPT v3.5 in November 2022. Material and methods: In all, 425 articles published between February 2022 and September 2023 (221 before and 204 after November 1, 2022) underwent ZeroGPT assessment of the level of AI generation in the final English-language version (abstract and body of the article). Two scores were obtained: probability of AI generation, in six grades from Human to AI; and percentage AI generation. Plagiarism was assessed on the Ithenticate application at submission. Articles in French were assessed in their English-language version as translated by a human translator, with comparison to automatic translation by Google Translate and DeepL. Results: AI-generated text was detected mainly in Abstracts, with a 10.1% rate of AI or considerable AI generation, compared to only 1.9% for the body of the article and 5.6% for the total body + abstract. Analysis for before and after November 2022 found an increase in AI generation in body + abstract, from 10.30 ± 15.95% (range, 0–100%) to 15.64 ± 19.8% (range, 0–99.93) (p < 0.04; NS for abstracts alone). AI scores differed between types of article: 14.9% for original articles and 9.8% for reviews (p < 0.01). The highest rates of probable AI generation were in articles from Japan, China, South America and English-speaking countries (p < 0.0001). Plagiarism rates did not increase between the two study periods, and were unrelated to AI rates. On the other hand, when articles were classified as “suspected” of AI generation (plagiarism rate ≥ 20%) or “non-suspected” (rate < 20%), the “similarity” score was higher in suspect articles: 25.7 ± 13.23% (range, 10–69%) versus 16.28 ± 10% (range, 0–79%) (p < 0.001). In the body of the article, use of translation software was associated with higher AI rates than with a human translator: 3.5 ± 5% for human translators, versus 18 ± 10% and 21.9 ± 11% respectively for Google Translate and DeepL (p < 0.001). Discussion: The present study revealed an increasing rate of AI use in articles published in OTSR. AI grades differed according to type of article and country of origin. Use of translation software increased the AI grade. In the long run, use of ChatGPT incurs a risk of plagiarism and scientific misconduct, and needs to be detected and signaled by a digital tag on any robot-generated text.

"Objectives: This study investigated whether individual coaching can improve role portrayal and emotional expression in opera secco recitatives. Study design: An experimental comparative study. Methods: Eighteen students (mean age 24 years) from Norway and Sweden majoring in opera singing volunteered as test persons. As singing tasks each test person studied a short opera secco recitative in their Voice Fach during 14 days. All recitatives were picked up from renowned Italian operas from the Classical period. The texts were translated in the singers’ mother tongue but performed in Italian, a foreign language to all test persons Thirteen test persons were enrolled in a Test group, and they were coached individually for 1h in interpretation of their singing tasks. During the intervention the test persons combined speaking the translated text in their native dialects with singing the recitative in Italian. The test persons were asked to distinguish various emotions and motivation in the singing task, and rehearsed how to express the singing task equally distinctly in Italian as in their native dialects. The singing task was recorded a capella immediately before and after the intervention. The test persons in the Control group recorded their singing tasks pre and post 1 h self-directed rehearsing on their singing tasks, without any coaching. The recordings of all test persons were presented in randomized order for ten expert listeners to rate the expression of emotions and role portrayal. The samples were also analysed acoustically. Results: Post coaching samples were rated significantly better in expression of various emotions and motivation compared to pre coaching samples. The Control group singers showed no significant changes in perceptual variables. Pausing increased in both groups after rehearsing. Conclusions: A short individual coaching in performance of an opera recitative seemed to stimulate young opera singers` emotional and motivational expression. © 2023"
"Health-related social needs (HRSNs) affect health outcomes and healthcare utilization. Patients' perspectives on the incorporation of HRSN screening in primary care settings is limited. We sought to explore adult primary care patient perspectives of HRSN screening from optional patient-provided free-text comments as part of a pilot self-administered HRSN screening survey on seven domains of HRSNs from the Accountable Health Communities HRSNs Screening Tool. The survey was available in English, Chinese or Spanish with a section titled ""Comments""that invited patient respondents to provide anonymous free-text responses. We performed a thematic analysis of the written patient comments. Of the 679 participants surveyed, 93 participants (13.7%) provided written comments. Participants expressed concern for others and gratitude for their health or socio-economic situation, commented on how HRSN screening could improve patient care, and shared stories of overcoming unmet HRSNs in the past. No written comments from participants conveyed dissatisfaction regarding HRSN screening. Identified themes of participant comments show participants' strong recognition of how health is impacted by unmet HRSNs. Our study adds to the literature of patient perspectives that support a role for HRSN screening in primary care that could help give voice to patient needs and facilitate the delivery of patient-centered care.  © The Author(s), 2023."
"This text analyses a pedagogical dispositif promoted in France from the 1980s under the name of “écriture inventée” (literally “invented writing”, more commonly used in English under the name of “invented spelling”) for the school literacy of young children in the école maternelle (preschool and kindergarten): without any systematic prior teaching, young children are supposed to learn the alphabetic code from practicing and engaging in the reflective analysis of their spontaneous writings. This analysis reveals an elitist conception of the young child that is part of certain pedagogical norms of the French école maternelle. Assuming the existence of a young child who learns through his or her own reflexive resources, as the ideal child of the culturally dominant social classes, leads to valuing distal forms of socialization (in which the bodies of socializing agents and socialized children are distant) and regulations of activity that are not very explicit and produce vast differences. The chapter first offers a socio-history of the dispositif by tracing its genesis from the first discoveries of the “spontaneous” graphic productions of young children by English-speaking researchers in the 1960s and 1970s. It then shows the penetration of the paradigm of invented spelling, through the work of the psychologist Emilia Ferreiro promoted in the 1970s and 1980s, into the French educational field, and then its didactization and inclusion in the formal preschool and kindergarten curriculum from the 2000s. The real curriculum is then studied, based on the results of an ethnographic survey. First, the teachers’ speech analysis show that they strongly perceive the social value that the pedagogical supervisors attribute to invented spelling while they are confronted with strong difficulties in its effective implementation. Finally, the observation of a classroom session shows three children with unequal literacy resources and demonstrates in concrete terms how the dispositif is socially unequal. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Judith Hangartner, Héloïse Durler, Regula Fankhauser and Crispin Girinshuti; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata Hook.f. & Thoms.) is cultivated in many tropical areas of the world for the multiple applications of the essential oil extracted from its flowers. The aim of this work was to determine the concentrations of macro-nutrientes and micro-nutrients in the different ylang-ylang organs in two treatments, without fertilization and with commercial fertilization, based on a nutritional analysis of the soil of a production farm located in Chongón, Guayas, Ecuador. The concentrations of N, P and Mg were significantly higher in the treatment with fertilization (16.82; 2.96; 3.81 vs. 14.63; 2.39; 3.12 g/kg, respectively). Concerning micronutrients, in the treatment with fertilization, Mn, Cu and Mo concentrations were significantly higher (73.00; 13.50; 1.28 vs. 44.96; 9.08; 0.50 mg/kg), while Cl concentration was significantly lower (1692.58 vs. 3488.25 mg/kg). Significant differences were also found in nutrient concentration as a function of organs. The C. odorata N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S extraction is 30.83; 3.46; 12.87; 25.50; 4.85 and 3.35 kg/ha, respectively. Higher concentrations of N, Ca and K are suggested for this crop. These results contribute to the improvement of the quality of fertilization in the ylang-ylang cultivation. © 2023, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University. All rights reserved."
"To counterbalance the scholarly attention that professional and conventional metaphors have attracted in Descriptive Translation Studies, this task-based study sets out to describe the strategies adopted by students when translating a specific type of creative metaphors: metaphorical puns in tourist texts. This product-oriented analysis is also combined with a retrospective verbal report that can shed light on the cognitive bearing these metaphors may have on translation. The analysis of the strategies adopted by 73 BA students revealed that the task completion was impeded by the nature of the metaphors and by their textual distribution. Moreover, the predilection of micro-strategies like literal translations and deletion suggests that appropriate creative solutions are disregarded in favor of source text faithfulness. Lastly, students did not show awareness of the metaphorical nature of the expressions they reported as problematic in the retrospective self-assessment report. This study therefore points out some pedagogical implications for including Metaphor Translation Competence in Translation Pedagogy by exploiting the bold nature of figurative puns. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This book invites a close textual encounter with the first 11 chapters of Genesis as an intimate drama of marginalised peoples wrestling with the rise of the world’s first grain states in the Mesopotamian alluvium. The initial 11 chapters of Genesis are often considered discordant and fragmentary, despite being a story of beginnings within the context of the Bible. Readers discover how these formative chapters cohere as a cross-generational account of peoples grappling with the hegemonic spread of domesticated grain production and the concomitant rise of the pristine states of Mesopotamia. The book reveals how key episodes from the Genesis narrative reflect major societal revolutions of the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia through a three-fold hermeneutical method: literary analysis of the Bible and contemporary cuneiform texts; modern scholarship from archaeological, anthropological, ecological, and historical sources; and relevant exegesis from the Second Temple and rabbinical era. These three strands entwine to recount a generally sequential story of the earliest archaic states as narrated by non-elites at the margins of these emerging state spaces. The Dawn of Agriculture and the Earliest States in Genesis 1–11 provides a fascinating reading of the first 11 chapters of Genesis, appealing to students and scholars of the Hebrew Bible and the Near East, as well as those working on ecological injustice from a religious vantage point. © 2024 Natan Levy."
"Objectives: This study aimed to trace the characters' actions and their transformations in Walid Seif's historical novel ""The Fire and the Phoenix"" in its two parts; the first is entitled ""The Black Flags,"" which explores the demise of the Umayyad kingdom and the establishment of the state of Bani al-Abbas. The second part is titled ""Saqr of Quraish,"" focusing on the restoration of the Umayyad state in Andalusia. Methods: This study involved highlighting the functional roles of the novel's characters and their most decisive actions. It followed a narrative program that showcased the characters' will, duty, ability, knowledge, and their relationships with each other. The research adopted the new historical approach, a theoretical school with foundations in the concept of historical development and the mechanisms of interpreting and reading literary texts. Results: The study found that the novelist was successful in internalizing the worlds of his characters, portraying their complex conflict dimensions and human transformations through their interaction with the complex circumstances surrounding them. Conclusion: The study recommends the need of using the tools of new historicism in analyzing characters in historical novels provides new horizons in analysis and interpretation. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan."
"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental but crucial task in natural language understanding, aiming at identifying entity mentions from free text. Current methods mainly use sequence-labeling and span-based models, where the former ignores the importance of token interaction, and the latter pays little attention to the global inter-dependency among entity tokens. In this work, we propose a novel NER model that consists of two branches: a Token-Pair Interaction Module (TPIM) and a U-shaped Network. The TPIM models head-tail relations between token pairs while capturing intrinsic token connectivity within entity boundaries. The U-shaped Network is employed to capture the contextual dependency in the token-pair relation matrix. Furthermore, we build a typical domain-specific entity dataset CCAEE based on real-world applications in the chemical accident domain. The experimental results on CCAEE and CLUENER datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 2013 IEEE."
"This article is a critical analysis of a fundamental judicial ethic, the appearance of impartiality, an increasingly important public issue that is poorly understood and woefully underexamined in jurisprudence and academic literature. The ethic is pivotal to the determination of judicial disqualification, a/k/a recusal, and the public's fragile trust in the rule of law. The article explains how a mysterious metaphorical device, the ""reasonable observer""(a descendant of the common law's ""reasonable man"") has been subjectively applied in a confusing and inconsistent manner in judicial disqualification cases. The unexamined approach has unwittingly undermined the plain text and the mandatory ethical obligation of recusal (i.e., a judge must disqualify when his or her impartiality might reasonably be questioned). The discussion: (a) analyzes the theoretical underpinnings of the reasonable person-observer analytical tool (""heuristic""); (b) explains how American jurisprudence has glibly transmogrified the appearance-recusal precept; (c) provides a unique and starkly contrasting analytical perspective demonstrating how select common law-based jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom) have painstakingly examined and applied the widely-recognized norm of appearance-based impartiality; and (d) synthesizes the preceding theoretical and jurisprudential information to support a proposal for a recalibrated metric and a pragmatic, clarifying heuristic. The article concludes with a model provision, in the form of a guiding ""commentary,""that summarizes the essential aspects of the appearance of bias precept. The article provides an interpretative approach that attempts to be faithful to the letter and spirit of the foundational judicial ethic.  © 2023 Zygmont Pines, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Since its introduction by Boszormenyi-Nagy and Spark (1973) in the 1970s, parentification has become a ubiquitous topic in the fields of family therapy and family psychology. In empirical research, parentification is regarded as a risk factor threatening the psychological development of children (Nuttall et al., 2019). However, some studies have indicated the absence of a significant correlation between parentification and maladaptive mental health outcomes (Hamin, 2006; Hsu, 2007), whereas other studies have revealed a negative correlation between the two constructs (Li, 2021; Chang & Kuo, 2000). To determine the long-term consequences of childhood parentification, that is, the relationship between childhood parentification and adult mental health, Hooper, Decoster, et al. (2011) conducted a meta-analysis of the relationship between self-reported childhood parentification and adult psychopathology. Their results revealed a significant positive correlation between self-reported childhood parentification and adult psychopathological factors, such as depression, substance use, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, and eating disorders, although the correlation coefficient was small. However, although they used various methods to collect relevant studies covering the period from 1984 to 2010, they included only 12 empirical studies and 12 effect sizes in their meta-analysis. Among all moderators included in the analysis, they focused on parentification type (emotional parentification and undifferentiated parentification) and ethnicity (White Americans and Black Americans). Given the universality of parentification in the context of family, adopting psychopathology as the only outcome variable may hinder the inclusion of studies in meta-analyses and reduce the generalizability of meta-analytical results. Over the past decade, many empirical studies have been conducted worldwide on parentification. Researchers in relevant fields have comprehensively explored the types, measurements, and research participants of parentification. Particularly, many studies have been conducted on parentification in China. In this study, we collected both English and Chinese articles on parentification and used a three-level meta-analytic model to comprehensively investigate the relationship between parentification and maladaptive mental health. We also investigated the moderators that affect the degree of correlation between parentification and maladaptive mental health to obtain further insights into this topic. We searched the following computerized databases from their inception until December 2021: Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System, National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, ProQuest, EBSCO (Academic Search Complete), and PsycArticles. From these databases, we identified Chinese and English articles whose titles or abstracts paired terms related to parentification (parentif* or role reverse or role conflict or boundary resolution or boundary disorder or boundary problems or young care*) with terms related to mental health (mental health or internaliz* or depressi* or anxi* or somatization or distress). Using this search strategy, we identified a total of 1,081 potential articles for our meta-analysis. After excluding duplicates, we obtained 621 articles. After reading the titles and abstracts of these articles, we further excluded studies with unrelated themes (409 articles), theoretical studies (28 articles), and qualitative studies (76 articles). Finally, after reading the full texts of these articles, we excluded 57 articles, including studies with repeated samples (3 articles), studies with incomplete statistical data (24 articles), studies with other evaluation criteria (8 articles), and studies whose statistical results could not be converted into product error correlation coefficients (22 articles). Ultimately, a total of 51 journal papers, theses, and dissertations (12 Chinese and 39 English) meeting the data selection criteria were included in the meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, studies are primarily coded in accordance with the following four aspects: sample characteristics (e.g., gender, age group, family context, cultural context), publishing characteristics (e.g., published or unpublished and year of publication), parentification characteristics (e.g., parentification type and measurements), and mental health outcomes (e.g., internalized and externalized behavioral problems). In this study, two coders (the first and third authors) independently coded the included studies. To eliminate the effect of selection bias on the results of the meta-analysis, inconsistencies were resolved through discussion with the corresponding author. Ultimately, a total of 230 independent effect sizes were obtained from 51 studies. Before conducting the meta-analysis, each correlation coefficient was transformed into a normally distributed Fisher’s z value. After the analysis, these z values were converted back into correlation coefficients. The R software (version 4.1.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to identify the relationship between parentification and maladaptive mental health outcomes. The results were as follows. (1) A significantly weak positive correlation was observed between parentification and maladaptive mental health outcomes (r = .144). Random sampling variation (Level 1), within-study effect size variation (Level 2), and between-study effect size variation (Level 3) accounted for 7.381%, 34.538%, and 58.081%, respectively, of the overall effect size variations, with a statistically significant difference observed between Level 2 and Level 3 (p < .001). (2) Family context had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between parentification and maladaptive mental health outcomes (p = .076). Specifically, the correlation coefficient between parentification and mental health outcomes was significantly larger among participants with a clinical family context (i.e., parents or siblings with long-term and chronic physical and mental diseases at home; r = .229)) than among those with a normal family context (r = .104). Cultural context also exerted a significant moderating effect on the relationship between parentification and mental health outcomes (p < .001). Specifically, the correlation coefficient between parentification and mental health outcomes (r =-.048) in studies on the eastern culture was significantly smaller than that in studies on the western culture (r = .192). (3) Parenting type had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between parentification and mental health outcomes (p < .001). Specifically, the correlation coefficient between unfairness and mental health outcomes (r = .279) was significantly larger than that between other types of parentification and mental health outcomes (r = .067 to .150). (4) Different mental health outcomes had a significant moderating effect (p = .018). Among these outcomes, the correlation coefficient between parentification and internalization (r = .177) was significantly larger than that between parentification and externalization (r = .085). However, the correlation coefficient between parentification and other mental health outcomes (e.g., total score and other problems) did not vary significantly from that of internalization. (5) No significant moderating effect was observed for other potential variables, such as gender, age, measurements, publication year, and publication status. Given the aforementioned results, we suggest that clinicians should not only evaluate the degree and duration of parentification (East & Weisner, 2009) but also differentiate between parentification types and their effects, particularly in terms of the psychological perception of parentification-related unfairness. To comprehensively and accurately evaluate the family history and parentification experience of individuals in the context of the Chinese culture, the sensitivity of cultural values must be maintained. This approach is the important feasible means for avoiding the hypothesis of “overpathologization” based on western theories (Kuperminc et al., 2009). Empirical research on parentification should consider the psychological aspects of parentification represented by perceived unfairness as a construct independent of the behavior of parentification (e.g., instrumental or emotional parentification). It should also utilize a second-order model to include the two types of parentification while developing or revising parentification scales. Relevant variables such as family and cultural contexts should be included to examine the process and mechanism of parentification in more detail. In this study, we addressed the limitations of traditional meta-analyses and used a three-level meta-analytical model to examine empirical research on parentification. The results of this meta-analysis may serve as systematic evidence for researchers and practitioners in this field. © 2023, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved."
"The article examines the main strategies of Ksenia Sobchak’s personal discourse and their linguistic implementation. The study is based on the texts from the electoral programme for her presidential candidacy, posted on the official “Civic Initiative” party website, appearances in debates on various Russian TV channels, and posts on social media accounts during the 2018 Russian presidential election campaign. We develop a corpus that presents communicative, pragmatic, gender-based and linguocultural features of the public speeches of an oppositional female politician. Critical discourse analysis and the linguopragmatic method are applied. The linguistic method she uses to create identity is also analysed. The work explores the discursive strategies and techniques, as well as the linguistic and rhetorical resources, used by the candidate to influence the electorate. The analysis proves that Ksenia Sobchak’s discursive activity is based on word play, which is determined by the communicative objective of her electoral campaign. © Siberian Federal University.

"To enable the people involved in a software development process to communicate and reason close to their area of knowledge, we are investigating and engineering a method that formalizes and integrates knowledge of multiple domains into domain models and into specifications in terms of those domain models. We follow an action research approach, starting with a diagnosis phase, in which we have previously defined a set of method objectives, and performed a systematic literature review. During action planning, we defined how we are going to develop the method—called Multi-Domain Formalization Method (MuDForM). This paper reports on the methodical support for using a domain model as the terminology for feature specifications. During action taking, we defined an initial version of the method and set up case studies. During the evaluation phase, we performed a case study to validate how well the method helps in the specification of processes and to realize the case-specific objectives of the customer. The case study pertains to the formalization of the ISO26262 standard for functional safety in the automotive domain. The created models are explained to the involved experts to ensure their consistency with the original text. We found that MuDForM is suitable to systematically formalize processes described in natural language, such that the resulting process models are fully expressed in terms of domain concepts and concepts from outside the domains and processes of interest. Further, during the specifying learning phase, we have extended our method with concepts, steps, and guidelines for grammatical analysis, for formalization of constraints, and for the specification of processes. © 2023 The Authors.

"Introduction: In recent years, the role of pharmacists has undergone significant transformation to become more patient-centered and involved in managing chronic diseases. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether pharmacist involvement in diabetes management is cost-effective. This study aimed to systematically review the cost-effectiveness and reporting quality in comprehensive economic evaluations of pharmacist management compared to standard care in diabetes. Methods: Eligible studies included cost-effectiveness analyses employing pharmacist professional services as the intervention for diabetes. A literature search was conducted in the bibliographic databases Pubmed, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the International Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database from their inception until July 2023. Two independent reviewers performed title, abstract, full-text screening, and data abstraction and assessed the quality of reporting and methodological approaches using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) checklists. Results: Twelve studies were identified with an average research quality score of 19.8, including cost-utility (n = 5) and cost-effectiveness (n = 7) analyses, with only four studies rated as high quality. The efficacy data were derived from randomized controlled trials (n = 7), retrospective studies (n = 2), and published literature sources (n = 2). Half of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, while the other half was in upper-middle and lower-middle-income countries, respectively. Despite significant variations in the cost of pharmacist intervention, consistent findings demonstrate that pharmacist involvement in diabetes management is more cost-effective or even cost-saving than standard care, primarily attributed to better glycemic control, enhanced patient compliance, and reduced risks of medication-related problems. Conclusion: This systematic review substantiates that pharmacist involvement in diabetes management is cost-effective compared with standard care. However, the overall quality of reporting needs to be improved, and high-quality evidence is urgently needed to support healthcare decision-making in pharmacy practice. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background: Digital health interventions (DHIs) are defined as digital technologies such as digital health applications and information and communications technology systems (including SMS text messages) implemented to meet health objectives. DHIs implemented using various technologies, ranging from electronic medical records to videoconferencing systems and mobile apps, have experienced substantial growth and uptake in recent years. Although the clinical effectiveness of DHIs for children and adolescents has been relatively well studied, much less is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review economic evaluations of DHIs for pediatric and adolescent populations. This study also reviewed methodological issues specific to economic evaluations of DHIs to inform future research priorities. Methods: We conducted a database search in PubMed from 2011 to 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. In total, 2 authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results to identify studies eligible for full-text review. We generated a data abstraction procedure based on recommendations from the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The types of economic evaluations included in this review were cost-effectiveness analyses (costs per clinical effect), cost-benefit analyses (costs and effects expressed in monetary terms as net benefit), and cost-utility analyses (cost per quality-adjusted life year or disability-adjusted life year). Narrative analysis was used to synthesize the quantitative data because of heterogeneity across the studies. We extracted methodological issues related to study design, analysis framework, cost and outcome measurement, and methodological assumptions regarding the health economic evaluation. Results: We included 22 articles assessing the cost-effectiveness of DHI interventions for children and adolescents. Most articles (14/22, 64%) evaluated interventions delivered through web-based portals or SMS text messaging, most frequently within the health care specialties of mental health and maternal, newborn, and child health. In 82% (18/22) of the studies, DHIs were found to be cost-effective or cost saving compared with the nondigital standard of care. The key drivers of cost-effectiveness included population coverage, cost components, intervention effect size and scale-up, and study perspective. The most frequently identified methodological challenges were related to study design (17/22, 77%), costing (11/22, 50%), and economic modeling (9/22, 41%). Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of economic evaluations of DHIs targeting pediatric and adolescent populations. We found that most DHIs (18/22, 82%) for children and adolescents were cost-effective or cost saving compared with the nondigital standard of care. In addition, this review identified key methodological challenges directly related to the conduct of economic evaluations of DHIs and highlighted areas where further methodological research is required to address these challenges. These included the need for measurement of user involvement and indirect effects of DHIs and the development of children-specific, generic quality-of-life outcomes. ©Tijana Stanic, Tuba Saygin Avsar, Manuel Gomes.

"Social media platforms such as Instagram are becoming increasingly popular sources for students to access anatomy educational resources. This review used content analysis to examine posts under the hashtag #anatomynotes and is the first to map the characteristics of anatomy education posts on Instagram and determine any temporal changes. Sample posts were gathered from April 2019 and April 2021 and categorized according to the technical format, purpose and author credentials. Engagement was recorded in the form of likes and comments. Overall, posts depicting illustrations remained the most popular format within both time periods. Three-dimensional models saw an increase in popularity with a 62.5% rise. Students remained the most common author type throughout and increased further in 2021 by 25%. Clinician authors and posts focusing on clinical education also increased in 2021 by 17.9% and 227%, respectively. Humor-based posts saw the greatest increase among the post purposes, with 1000% more recorded in 2021. Engagement overall saw a decline with notably significant reductions in average likes per post among all text-based posts (−72%, p < 0.0001), all illustrative posts (−51%, p = 0.0013), and a decline in the presence of comments among all text-based posts (−65.1%, p = 0.0158). These findings highlight that Instagram is a popular platform for facilitating near-peer teaching while increasingly providing a space where students and clinicians can interact. Additionally, it highlights the benefits of the platform for visually focused learners. However, future research should seek to determine whether Instagram can facilitate deeper learning and have an impact on academic and clinical performance. © 2023 The Authors.

"This paper firstly researches the integration of the concept of establishing moral integrity into the work of Civic and political education in colleges and universities and analyzes the thinking and path of the integration of the concept of establishing moral integrity into the work of Civic and political education in colleges and universities, to put forward a new system of Civic and political courses under the concept of establishing moral integrity and establishing people. Secondly, under the perspective of reinforcement learning, the Bellman optimal strategy equation, direct strategy search, and proximal strategy optimization algorithm are compared, respectively, and then the Civic and political education based on the proximal strategy optimization algorithm is proposed. Then, the online learning group formation strategy of the Civics course is constructed through the proximal strategy optimization algorithm, and the Civics education in colleges and universities based on the proximal strategy optimization algorithm is empirically analyzed. The results show that in the algorithmic analysis, the PPO algorithm is overall superior to the path-based, embedding-based, and strategy network reinforcement learning-based methods on the FB15K-237 dataset. On analyzing online learning group formation strategies for Civics courses, the first group of learning members tends to prefer audio learning resources, and the fourth group prefers text learning resources, with a clear manifestation of proximity. This study has promoted the concept of ""cultivating morality and nurturing people""throughout the work of Civic and Political Education.  © 2023 Yangjun Jing, published by Sciendo."
"This review examines John W. Creswell and David Creswell’s sixth edition, which covers the most popular research methods, offering readers a comprehensive understanding and practical guidance in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. The review includes observations on existing drawbacks, gaps, and ideas on potential areas for improvement in the book. The book is an excellent entry point for understanding the three broad research designs. It stands out for incorporating various methods and empowering researchers to effectively align them with specific research questions, objectives, and philosophical underpinnings. However, it could be further refined by incorporating newer research approaches and expanding practical aspects such as data collection, sampling strategies, and data analysis techniques. With these improvements, the sixth edition could further solidify its position as a comprehensive and accessible guide adeptly catering to researchers, educators, and students. Despite the book’s many strengths, there are opportunities for refinement in future editions, incorporating newer approaches to research designs and expanding practical aspects such as data collection, sampling strategies, and data analysis techniques. This review highlights that, with these suggested improvements, future editions could not only maintain but also enhance the text’s comprehensive and accessible nature, further solidifying its status as a vital resource for researchers, educators, and student. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"It is important to understand the evolution of Android malware as this facilitates the development of defence techniques by proactively capturing malware features. So far, researchers mainly rely on dendrogram or family-tree analysis for malware&#x0027;s evolutionary development. However, our research finds that these techniques cannot support comprehensive malware evolution modelling, which provides a detailed explanation for why Android malware samples evolve in specific ways. This shortcoming is mainly caused by the coarse-grained clustering and analysis of malware samples. For example, because these works do not divide malware samples of a family into variant sets and explore the evolution principles among those sets, they usually fail to capture new variants that have been empowered by the feature &#x2018;drifting&#x2019; in evolution. To address this problem, we propose a fine-grained and in-depth analysis of Android malware. Our experimental work systematically reveals the phylogenetic relationships among the variant sets for a deeper malware evolution analysis. We introduce five metrics: silhouette coefficient, creation date, variant labels, the presentativeness of the variant set formula, and the correctness of the linked edges to evaluate the correctness of our analysis. The results show that our variant clustering achieved a high silhouette value at a small sample distance (0.3), a small standard deviation (three months and 16 days) date based on when the malware samples are lastly modified, a high label consistency (91.4&#x0025;), a high representativeness (93.1&#x0025;) of the variant set formula. All the linked variant sets are connected based on our PhyloNet construction rules. We further analyse the coding details of Android malware for each variant set and summarise models of their evolutionary development. In this work, we successfully expose two major models of malware evolution: <italic>active evolution</italic> and <italic>passive evolution</italic>. We also disclose four technical explanations on the incentives of the two evolution models (two for each model respectively). These findings are valuable for proactive defence against newly emerged malware samples. IEEE"
"Based on the purpose of improving the communication power of the computational intelligence short videos of China Communist Youth League, this paper takes six typical computational intelligence short video IDs and their popular computational intelligence short videos of the Communist Youth League at the provincial level as the research object investigates the characteristics along with the influencing factors of communication power from four aspects: expression form, content presentation, title text, and local characteristics through content analysis of Communist Youth League computational intelligence short videos. China communist youth league is the organization of young people between the ages of 14–28 which is run by chinese communist party with the purpose of training upcoming party members as well as officials. These six specific IDs of Communist youth league are selected as these accounts have consistently excellent performance in the ranking of government affairs TikTok accounts, and they have certain typicality and research significance. The novelty of this paper is an empirical analysis of Computational Intelligence short video communication. The methodologies that are included in this research are Release frequency that describes video update frequency, word frequency analysis that describes the keywords to follow in the short videos and statistical analysis of coding strategies. These Analysis were carried out through content and case study which was done using python 3.0’s pandas, snownlp and other functional packages. The criterias which are used to evaluate the videos are views, likes, content, video format, form of expression, title form, local specialities show the engagement of the viewers in content as well as it helps in reaching the audience. Through the research, it is found that the computational intelligence short videos’ communication power of the provincial Communist Youth League is related to video duration, expression form, video content, title text, local characteristics, and audience psychological behavior, but has no obvious positive correlation with title form. The advantage of computational intelligence short videos of the provincial Communist Youth League is that the party media has clear positioning, rich content, and innovative forms, but at the same time, there are some problems, such as unclear “youth” features, lack of local characteristics and audience interaction. This paper refines the characteristics of excellent computational intelligence in short videos of the Communist Youth League and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for the shortcomings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Public film review is an important reference standard for film quality evaluation. 67.9% of users in China choose to use Weibo to share their personal film-watching feelings, and more than 80% of users say that word of mouth about a film on Weibo is easy to influence their film-watching behavior. This paper collected 236,011 Weibo topic data of 41 Chinese films in 2022. Sentiment time curve clustering model is used to explore the influence of sentiment changes on consumers’ film preferences and thus on film success. By combining the competitive distance measurement method and the partitioning algorithm, this paper selects the K-shape+SBD method with the best profile coefficient performance to cluster the sentiment time series data, and then the study found that the Weibo topic text clustering of 41 Chinese films was divided into four categories, showing four trends of “M-type”, “slowly descending”, “forward-inverted V-type” and “slowly rising” respectively. The changing trend of sentiment will significantly affect the success of films. Films with “slowly rising” are more likely to achieve commercial and word-of-mouth success, “M-type” and “forward-inverted V-type” are more likely to achieve better word-of-mouth, and “forward-inverted V-type” can attract more users to post film reviews. © 2023 SPIE."
"The history of independent Myanmar is replete with authoritarian and illiberal political regimes that have repressed the prospects of representative governance and limited the opportunities for economic development. A period of political and economic reform between 2011 and 2021 – which can now be considered an interregnum – ushered in hope and opportunity across much of Myanmar society for the first time in generations, although for some marginalised groups, such as the Muslim Rohingya, these opportunities never arrived. Any semblance of improved governance and economic opportunities for Myanmar’s general population evaporated, however, on the morning of 1 February 2021 following a military coup. This volume examines the consequences of this coup on Myanmar’s politics, economy and society, and this chapter provides an overview of some key elements of the volume, including the types of texts and sources employed, a brief historical analysis of Myanmar since colonial times and the chapter and volume structures. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Adam Simpson and Nicholas Farrelly."
"Gamification holds significant importance as an efficacious means to motivate individuals, stimulate their engagement, and foster desired behaviors. There is an increasing interest among researchers in exploring the domain of gamification. Consequently, it becomes crucial to identify specific research trends within this field. This study employs a comprehensive analysis of 4743 articles sourced from the Scopus database, utilizing the topic modeling approach, with the objective of discerning research patterns and trends within the gamification domain. The findings revealed the existence of thirteen distinct topics within the field. Notably, 'Health training,' 'Enhancing learning with technology,' and 'Game design framework' emerged as the most prominent topics, based on their frequency of research publications and popularity. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to stay abreast of the latest advancements in gamification. The identified issues through topic modeling can be employed to identify gaps in current research and potential directions for future research endeavors. © 2013 IEEE."
"The article offers new evidence of a remarkably dynamic reception and adaptation of Basil of Caesarea’s writings in sixth-century Palestinian monastic milieux. More specifically, the analysis focuses on an articulated and innovative notion of authorship that emerges in Theodore of Petra’s Life of Theodosius and Cyril of Scythopolis’ Monastic Lives. Cyril and Theodore conceive Basil’s writings not merely as ancient and authoritative reservoir of quotations but rather as raw material that the authors freely recast, through adaptation, into new narrations and teachings. In this case, the theoretical and terminological framework of citation studies is not sufficient anymore to capture the engagement of the author with the old text. This engagement is that of a dynamic collaboration that results in a new text – a new building, in Theodore’s words – with dual authorship. Along with this, the present analysis offers two further contributions. Firstly, thanks to new data, this survey confirms, improves, and articulates our acquaintance with Basil’s circulation in sixth-century Palestine. Finally, the texts examined shed new light on the monastic practices of reading and interiorization of revered authors’ writings. Basil’s writings undergirded the monks’ lives and literature to the extent that influenced and directed their spiritual journey. © 2023 by Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses."
"This paper remarks the use of literary texts as tools for research and teaching social psychology, mainly within a social representations perspective. We propose an archive research on identity within The late Mattia Pascal by Luigi Pirandello. Through a thematic analysis supported by AtlasTi, insights from Pirandello’s work, such as the idea of «double» and «multiple», appear to anticipate issues later becoming salient in contemporary theories on identity. We suggest that literary texts become privileged instruments not only to investigate meaning-making, but also to understand trajectories of change, anticipating their use in scientific theories and in common sense. © 2023 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

"Unlike text analysis for which topic models are historically developed, traffic video analysis is dealing with much simpler topics, made of restricted motion patterns. In this paper, we propose a dual-layer direction-oriented framework for more efficient traffic motion patterns description based on topic models through considering the simplicity of traffic topics. The aforesaid framework compels the involved topic models to learn the foreknown visually meaningful motion patterns that exist in traffic scenes, as developed theoretically in this paper. Experimental results produced by common datasets show that the proposed method provides more intuitive topics for traffic flow description. Based on experimental results, our framework outperforms other topic-model based methods by 4% to more than 11% in detecting abnormal events, in terms of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. In addition to that, in a scene analysis evaluation at intersections equipped with traffic signals, our method reaches 4% higher traffic phase detection accuracy, compared to conventional topic models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Intelligent Transportation Systems Japan."
"Cross-modal representation learning aims to learn a shared representation space where data from multiple modalities can be effectively compared, fused, and understood. This paper investigates the role of increased diversity in the similarity score matrix in enhancing the performance of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a multi-modal learning model that establishes a connection between images and text within a joint embedding space. Two transforming approaches, sine and sigmoid (including two versions), are incorporated into the CLIP model to amplify larger values and diminish smaller values within the similarity matrix (logits). Hardware limitations are addressed using a more compact text encoder (DistilBERT) and a pre-Trained ResNet50 image encoder. The proposed adaptations are evaluated on various benchmarks, including image classification and image/text retrieval tasks, using 10 benchmark datasets such as Food101, Flickr30k, and COCO. The performance of the adapted models is compared to the base CLIP model using Accuracy, mean per class, and Recall@k metrics. The results demonstrate improvements in Accuracy (up to 5.32% enhancement for the PatchCamelyon dataset), mean per class (up to 14.48% enhancement for the FGVCAircraft dataset), and retrieval precision (with an increase of up to 45.20% in Recall@1 for the COCO dataset), compared to the baseline algorithm (CLIP).  © 2013 IEEE."
"Purpose: This study aims to understand the extent of privacy concerns regarding voice-activated personal assistants (VAPAs) on Twitter. It investigates three key areas: (1) the effect of privacy-related press coverage on public sentiment and discussion volume; (2) the comparative negativity of privacy-focused conversations versus general conversations; and (3) the specific privacy-related topics that arise most frequently and their impact on sentiment and discussion volume. Design/methodology/approach: A dataset of 441,427 tweets mentioning Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021 were collected. Privacy-related press coverage has also been monitored. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the dictionary-based software LIWC and VADER, whereas text mining packages in R were used to identify privacy-related issues. Findings: Negative privacy-related news significantly increases both negativity and volume in Twitter conversations, whereas positive news only boosts volume. Privacy-related tweets were notably more negative than general tweets. Specific keywords were found to either increase or decrease the sentiment and discussion volume. Additionally, a temporal evolution in sentiment, with general attitudes toward VAPAs becoming more positive, but privacy-specific discussions becoming more negative was observed. Originality/value: This research augments the existing online privacy literature by employing text mining methodologies to gauge consumer sentiments regarding privacy concerns linked to VAPAs, a topic currently underexplored. Furthermore, this research uniquely integrates established theories from privacy calculus and social contract theory to deepen our analysis. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Digital games offer opportunities for the youth’s development of multimodal literacy required in the technology-driven world. However, both digital games and multimodal literacy are undervalued in rural contexts characterized by migrant parents and left-behind children. This qualitative case study conceptualized systematic guidance to foster students’ multimodal literacy through digital games and trialled its possibilities and challenges in enhancing left-behind children of migrant workers in a suburban school. Sixteen student participants engaged in critical game analysis and game video design in a 16-session classroom-based program, with the guidance of the researchers and two local teachers. Multiple data-collection methods were applied to capture students’ learning progress aligned with the teachers’ perceptions. Thematic analysis and multimodal analysis were utilized to process data. The findings indicate that this instructional approach deepened and broadened the students’ critical viewing and application of multimodal texts and enhanced their proficiency in leveraging digital tools for multimodal communication. The challenges include students’varied competencies and motivation, time constraints, and limited access to digital devices. We advocate for integrating DGBL in literacy classrooms, thus catering to left-home students’ demands and social needs in the digital age. Meanwhile, joint efforts are necessitated to address perennial challenges in this education reform and inequities within the process. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Joint communication and sensing utilizing wide bandwidth and additional spectral bands within the 30&#x2013;100 GHz range presents exciting opportunities for 6G networks. It enables improved spectrum utilization and enhanced environmental awareness. However, achieving frequency agility in a universal array interface that seamlessly operates across licensed, unlicensed, and shared bands poses significant challenges. This article addresses this challenge by presenting a crucial component, specifically the architecture of an ultra-wideband beamforming transmitter (Tx) that employs: 1) an ultra-wideband vector modulator phase shifter; 2) a broadband power amplifier (PA) enabled by inverse design method; and 3) a variable gain amplifier (VGA) with a tailored broadband frequency response. To allow for precise phase control across such a large bandwidth, a 90<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^\circ$</tex-math> </inline-formula> hybrid-Marchand balun-based bandwidth extension network is proposed for ultra-wideband I/Q signal generation. The principle, analysis, and design of the extension network are presented in detail, leveraging a novel broadband modeling technique. The beamformer prototype implemented in 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS process maintains extremely low maximum phase error below 0.5 LSB, rms phase error of 1.24<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^\circ$</tex-math> </inline-formula>&#x2013;2.8<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^\circ$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, and rms gain error of 0.24&#x2013;0.35 dB, enabled by the proposed 5-bit phase shifter covering 36&#x2013;91 GHz. The Tx also demonstrates 30&#x2013;35 dB gain with 10 dB gain control, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{OP}_{\text{1\,dB}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> of 9&#x2013;13.5 dBm and supports 10.8 Gbps 64-QAM modulation with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$-$</tex-math> </inline-formula>25.6 dB EVM with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$P_{\text{avg}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> of 4 dBm at 60 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first beamforming Tx that covers the frequency range from 5G FR2 to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$W$</tex-math> </inline-formula> band, offering a fractional bandwidth of 87% (defined by the bandwidth over which the maximum phase error is below 1/2 LSB).

"Fault analysis (FA) is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure. It plays an important role in ensuring the quality in manufacturing process. Traditional FA techniques are time-consuming and labor-intensive, relying heavily on human expertise and the availability of failure inspection equipment. In semiconductor industry, a large amount of FA reports are generated by experts to record the fault descriptions, fault analysis path and fault root causes. With the development of Artificial Intelligence, it is possible to automate the industrial FA process while extracting expert knowledge from the vast FA report data. The goal of this research is to develop a complete expert knowledge extraction pipeline for FA in semiconductor industry based on advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Our research aims at automatically predicting the fault root cause based on the fault descriptions. First, the text data from the FA reports are transformed into numerical data using Sentence Transformer embedding. The numerical data are converted into latent spaces using Generalized-Controllable Variational AutoEncoder. Then, the latent spaces are classified by Gaussian Mixture Model. Finally, Association Rules are applied to establish the relationship between the labels in the latent space of the fault descriptions and that of the fault root cause. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated with real data of semiconductor industry collected over three years. The average correctness of the predicted label achieves 97.8%. The method can effectively reduce the time of failure identification and the cost during the inspection stage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"With the popularity and widespread use of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, massive amounts of text and image information posted by a variety of users have flooded these social media platforms. Thus, multi-modal named entity recognition (MNER) has become a research hotspot for the task of extracting named entities from multi-modal data. Empirically, the visual clues unrelated to text data may introduce uncertain or even negative impacts on the named entity recognition. The considerations of the relevance of multi-modal data have been ignored in the previous studies. In this paper, to effectively measure the relationship between text data and visual cues for improving the accuracy of named entities, we propose a text image scene graph fusion (TISGF) approach with a text-image similarity assessment module (TISA) and a text-image fusion module (TIF) for MNER. Specifically, we first construct two (visual and textual) scene graphs to exploit the joint features of objects and relations in text and image and encode the two scene graphs separately using a specific encoder pair. In this way, we can obtain both object-level and relationship-level cross-modal features. Subsequently, TISA is used to compute the similarity of the image and text data and to determine the proportion of visual information that will be retained for fusion. Finally, we use TIF to achieve a unified multi-modal representation of each word and predict the entity type using CRF. Extensive experiment results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed method for the MNER task. IEEE"
"Background: Facial nerve palsy (FNP) leads to a combination of aesthetic and functional deficits with profound psychosocial consequences. Significant advances have been made in restoring dynamic function through a range of facial reanimation solutions. Patient-reported severity scales are predetermined metrics that provide limited insight into patient values and perceptions. A qualitative study was conducted to elicit the experiences of patients with FNP and explore their views and motivations for seeking therapy. Methods: Participants were sourced from the Sydney Head and Neck Cancer Institute Database, Australia. Eligibility for the study included age over 18 years and a diagnosis of complete FNP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the transcripts were subjected to thematic text analysis. Results: Nineteen patients consented to participate in the study. One was excluded due to an isolated marginal mandibular nerve palsy. Five main themes emerged: eye symptoms, fear of judgement and social withdrawal, aversion to further invasive surgeries, the need for multidisciplinary streamlined care and lack of public awareness. Conclusion: Eye symptoms and the social consequences of FNP carry significant impact on both personal and professional lives. There is a paucity of services that can support patients across the complex spectrum of problems seen in FNP. © 2023, Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons. All rights reserved."
"This paper proposes a new multi-modal question-answering task, named as Cross-Modal Information Complementation based Question Answering (CroMIC-QA), to promote the exploration on bridging the semantic gap between visual and linguistic signals. The proposed task is inspired by the common phenomenon that, in most user-generated QA scenarios, the information of the given textual question is incomplete, and thus it is required to merge the semantics of both the text and the accompanying image to infer the complete real question. In this work, the CroMIC-QA task is first formally defined and compared with the classic Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. On this basis, a specified dataset, CroMIC-QA-Agri, is collected from an online QA community in the agriculture domain for the proposed task. A group of experiments is conducted on this dataset, with the typical multi-modal deep architectures implemented and compared. The experimental results show that the appropriate text/image presentations and text-image semantic interaction methods are effective to improve the performance of the framework. IEEE"
"Because online reviews facilitate consumers’ purchase decisions, prior research investigates factors impacting review helpfulness. By integrating Kuhlthau’s information search process model and the heuristic-systematic model, we propose that a situational factor–product quality uncertainty–shapes consumers’ information search processes and suggests which reviews are most helpful. The literature suggests that review length and information richness positively impact review helpfulness. However, their joint effect conditional on product quality uncertainty is unknown. An experiment reveals that consumers are motivated to process individual reviews only when uncertainty is high (i.e. when consumers disagree on product quality). Analysis of over 37,000 online reviews indicates that, under high uncertainty, short reviews with rich information are most helpful. Consistent with the experiment results, neither factor drives helpfulness when uncertainty is low (i.e. when previous consumers exhibit a consensus on product quality). We present managerial implications for stimulating “short and sweet” reviews to increase review helpfulness. © 2023 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science."
"Currently, with the continuous in-depth research and application of blockchain access control, security issues on the blockchain have become a focus of attention. Based on CPABE, this paper proposes a trusted and secure blockchain access control scheme based on ciphertext policy. Firstly, a decentralized attribute-based encryption algorithm (DABE) is adopted to achieve distributed calculation of user attribute private keys, effectively solving the problems of high trust cost and single point of failure caused by the key center generating private keys in traditional CPABE. At the same time, a private key consensus verification protocol based on zero-knowledge proof is designed to ensure the correctness and security of user attribute private keys without leaking private key information. Through the analysis of on-chain security and experimental simulation, the results show that this scheme has better performance while maintaining high security and is more suitable for distributed access control with large attribute scales. © 2023 SPIE."
"Adolescent pregnancy is a major public health issue with profound implications for health and socioeconomic factors. The use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) could be an interesting strategy to reduce the unintended pregnancy rate. However, the cost of LARC is still a barrier to widespread adoption. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness and economic impact of LARC compared with non-LARC methods in preventing unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023387735) and conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. We included articles covering adolescents aged 10-19 years without language restrictions that evaluated the use of LARC compared with non-LARC in terms of effectiveness and the public health costs of unintended pregnancy. The search for articles included the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Lilacs, using the entry terms “Adolescent” and “Long-Acting Reversible Contraception.” We evaluated the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence for each outcome of interest. The search retrieved a total of 1,169 articles and, after the title and abstract, we identified 40 articles for full-text analysis. Out of the 40 studies evaluated, 4 articles met the eligibility criteria for cost evaluation, and 1 met the eligibility criteria for effectiveness as an outcome. In conclusion, LARC emerges as the most effective and cost-effective contraceptive method. The cost of utilizing LARC, especially the copper IUD, is significantly lower than the costs attributable to unintended pregnancies in adolescence. © 2023 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology"
"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a natural method of choice for distributed parameter learning. For smooth and strongly convex consensus optimization problems, it has been shown that ADMM and some of its variants enjoy linear convergence in the distributed setting, much like in the traditional non-distributed setting. The optimization problem associated with parameter estimation in quantile regression is neither smooth nor strongly convex (although is convex) and thus it seems can only have sublinear convergence at best. Although this insinuates slow convergence, we show that, if the local sample size is sufficiently large compared to parameter dimension and network size, distributed estimation in quantile regression actually exhibits linear convergence up to the statistical precision, the precise meaning of which will be explained in the text.  © 1991-2012 IEEE."
"Animal-standpoint criticism focuses on the way human rights are treated in literary texts. It is against speciesism, which is a kind of species-based discrimination which gives different values to different species and inevitably leads to a hierarchy among species. Speciesism is thus regarded as a kind of racism by those defining and theorizing the field of animal-standpoint criticism, which is essentially against the supremacy of the human species over animals and which seeks the establishment of equality among species. Animal rights are emphasized by this criticism and the idea that animals are to be used for human benefits and/or progress is challenged. J. M. Coetzee, the South African novelist known for his allegorical works of fiction set in unknown times and places as well as his questioning stance on matters of colonialism, remains a writer of fiction who consciously tries to give a voice to animals, which cannot speak for themselves and are subjected to not only illegal but cruel treatment by human beings. For Coetzee, it is wrong to permit the establishment of a hierarchy between humans and animals and to disregard animal rights seeing them as entities in the service of human beings. From Disgrace to Life and Times of Michael K., several novels, as well as nonfictional works by Coetzee, focus in some way or another on the rights of animals and the strange ties between human beings and them. It is realised in this treatments of animals that Coetzee also carries out his critique of Western rationalism through his focus on the related issue. © 2023, Istanbul University Press.

"The study aims to develop a combined method for finding relevant documents using automated Nature Language Processing (NLP), which improves the quality of results based on informative text parameters. To adapt the search method to the text type, it is necessary to combine several algorithms for processing sets of texts. Thus, results of a search in sets of documents should provide the analysis of separate components of the text, especially interesting for the analyst. To achieve this goal, the authors: conducted a brief review of the status of the issue in the field of NLP and full-text search; classified the methods and means of word processing available to Data Science specialists; chose the most promising characteristics of the texts in terms of the purpose of the work. The effectiveness of joint ranking of specialized articles devoted to the solution of specific scientific issues and articlesreviews of the subject area of large volume in terms of their relevance to the analyst’s request was studied. The possibility of using the reference text chosen by the analyst as a basic standard for querying and searching and ranking similar scientific and technical documents is considered. Experiments with text sets were performed, which allowed confirming the informativeness of the parameters of text objects selected by the authors and the proposed composition of algorithms for their processing based on a combination of TF-IDF method and relevance ranking method using the distance between term occurrences. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"The article is an analytical review of the works of the interregional exhibition «Keepers of Family Traditions» held in May 2021 at the Novosibirsk State Art Museum. Generalizing factors (general) are justified on the example of individual works (particular). As a result of the stylistic, semantic analysis of the literary text of the works, the systemic factors of the organization of the exhibition are determined as a reflection of the mentality of the era, the worldview of social, national, ethnic groups and their individuals. Art historical analysis allowed us to consider the work as a holistic artistic image that exists in the dialectical interaction of process and result: the evolution and transformation of the author’s picture of the world, and its correlation with the picture of the world of our contemporaries by creating a consistently developing narrative of the exposition. Event analysis revealed the regularity of the content and organization of the exhibition: each element of the work, the work itself and their collection in the exhibition are built as interacting in time and space. Thus, each exhibit reflects a certain moment of the era, and their totality reflects its development. © Siberian Federal University. All rights reserved."
"That our relationship with art, both in the museum and in society, is currently undergoing radical transformation; that Art History in particular is destined to be revolutionized by the digital; and that the brand-new Digital Art History is poised to tell us and show us something other than what we have been able to see and know up until now: this can now seem seductively evident. This is then the starting point for the paper, which at the same time aims to return to some preliminary questions: What, on the one hand, is it to see and explain a painting better, and how do we go about it [§1]? How, on the other hand, can research linked to the digitization of images—coming well after the one on languages and texts processing—help us to enhance and sharpen our gaze [§2]? These are the issues addressed here in a frontal and critical manner. The article finds its initial impetus in a certain conception of what experiencing & explaining the picture means, in its fundamental knotting. It is argued that the enterprise of knowledge cannot be cut off from it: hence, by contrast, the gnoseological limits inherent in automatic processing, based on the scanning of large corpora. At the same time, certain key principles of analysis in Art History, Aesthetic theory and Visual Semiotics are reviewed and discussed: motifs (in a critical conception of traditional iconography), diagrams (in close relation to the notion of figurality), and the interweaving of the visual and the verbal (an essential and delicate issue in our relationship to the work of art, which Digital Humanities must by no means sidestep) [§3]. In the light of this assessment, the article proposes a series of original digital devices capable of better tying together, and enhancing, the experience and explanation of the painting [§4]. Drawing on some case studies of Gustave Courbet’s paintings, the aim is to combine the phenomenological demands of a singular encounter with each painting with those of an invention of semiotic value that is fundamentally linked to an active edition & montage of the artworks themselves. In short, we want to show the positive paths to a renewal in which machines could be an essential adjuvant, provided we do not stick to the research directions and to the intervention modalities we have seen celebrated and programmed to date. © 2023, Universite de Liege, Centre de Semiotique et Rhetorique.

"Video captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for a given video clip. Existing methods mainly focus on end-to-end representation learning via word-by-word comparison between predicted captions and ground-truth texts. Although significant progress has been made, such supervised approaches neglect semantic alignment between visual and linguistic entities, which may negatively affect the generated captions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical modular network to bridge video representations and linguistic semantics at four granularities before generating captions: entity, verb, predicate, and sentence. Each level is implemented by one module to embed corresponding semantics into video representations. Additionally, we present a reinforcement learning module based on the scene graph of captions to better measure sentence similarity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art models on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including MSVD, MSR-VTT, and VATEX. The source code and trained models will be made available to the public. IEEE"
"The article is devoted to a private letter written at the end of November 1812 in Tula and preserved in a small archive of the Tula and Kaluga noblemen, the Ievlevs. Analysis of the document allows us to identify the author — Pavel Svechin, an official under the Tula governor, as well as the addressees of the letter — the landowner Alexander Prokofievich Ievlev and his son Peter. The name of the author of the addendum and others mentioned in the letter as well as the circumstances in which the epistolary text appeared, have been established. The reason for writing the letter was the news from the battlefields, which reached the provincial town and were passed on, probably to the estate where the addressees lived. However, the events of the Patriotic War were presented in a semi-fantastic form: the dates, names of commanders, and events were mixed up. The author of the letter does not seem to care much for the credibility or accuracy of the information conveyed. The only news that was transmitted without distortion concerns the bestowal of the Order of St. George, First Class, and the title of Prince of Smolensk upon Field Marshal Kutuzov. The article focuses on the reasons for the appearance of distortions and the mechanism of rumor formation; conclusions are drawn about what really worried the Tula landowners in the late autumn of 1812.

"Embodied agents navigating unknown environments face the challenge of optimizing exploration based on semantic information. Conventional methods, reliant on collected data or pre-defined rules, have limitations in scalability and applicability, while pretrained language models based methods focusing on textual modality encounter perceptual noise, which affects decision-making. To mitigate these problems, this paper presents Prompt-based Vision Context Semantic Exploration (PoSE), an innovative method that leverages prior knowledge from vision language models (VLMs) to suppress perceptual noise. Through its unique design of prompts that use existential logic, PoSE reduces misidentifications of target objects within the observed environment. It also introduces a unique exploration map to translate target locations into exploration coordinates. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating improved performance against previous rulebased and task-specific data-driven exploration policies. Furthermore, PoSE&#x0027;s semantic exploration policy offers enhancements over pretrained language-model based exploration methods that focus on text modality, showcasing its effectiveness and generality.

"This paper analyzes the English forms must, may and could using a Columbia School framework. As with previous sign-based analyses of the modals, must, may and could are considered members of a grammatical system; this paper posits a grammatical system of Likelihood, whereby the meanings of must, may and could are relative to one another. These signs are first examined in a text from Malcolm Gladwell [2019. Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don’t Know. Boston, MA: Little, Brown] which provides rich context for meaning analysis, and later, the hypothesized meanings are tested in a large corpus, the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [Davies, Mark. 2008.

Through the testing of the observed occurrence patterns within COCA, must, may and could show a general pattern of usage which supports the proposed meaning hypotheses. © 2023 International Linguistic Association."
"A tumor of cancer contains thousands of mutated genes. Early diagnosis, treatment, and full recovery depend on the results of genetic analysis. Most cancer patients can be saved if doctors are able to identify and treat the underlying genetic mutations that cause the disease as early as possible. The primary purpose of this investigation is to propose a clinically actionable multiclass classifier for genetic mutations that employs a natural language processing approach for classification. Two text transformation models, CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, are used to transform the text into a matrix of token counts. Four machine learning classification models—Naïve Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, and Logistic Regression Classifier—are applied to the keywords count representation (sparse matrix) of text descriptions. Each classifier’s accuracy is calculated using the confusion matrix. In conclusion, the empirical results show that the random forest machine learning model has the highest accuracy (60%) compared to the other classifiers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"A visualization notation is a recurring pattern of symbols used to author specifications of visualizations, from data transformation to visual mapping. Programmatic notations use symbols defined by grammars or domain-specific languages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, Vega-Lite) or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas). Designers and prospective users of grammars and libraries often evaluate visualization notations by inspecting galleries of examples. While such collections demonstrate usage and expressiveness, their construction and evaluation are usually ad hoc, making comparisons of different notations difficult. More rarely, experts analyze notations via usability heuristics, such as the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. These analyses, akin to structured close readings of text, can reveal design deficiencies, but place a burden on the expert to simultaneously consider many facets of often complex systems. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a metrics-based approach to usability evaluation and comparison of notations in which metrics are computed for a gallery of examples across a suite of notations. While applicable to any visualization domain, we explore the utility of our approach via a case study considering statistical graphics that explores 40 visualizations across 9 widely used notations. We facilitate the computation of appropriate metrics and analysis via a new tool called NotaScope. We gathered feedback via interviews with authors or maintainers of prominent charting libraries (n &#x003D; 6). We find that this approach is a promising way to formalize, externalize, and extend evaluations and comparisons of visualization notations. IEEE"
"The language used to market and describe wine is characterised by the subjectivity and creativity of the terms used. This makes the encoding and decoding of oenology-related texts a demanding task. As genres in this field are persuasive in nature, the correct translation of wine-related terminology is crucial to sell the product. In wine-related genres, phraseological units have been understudied especially with regards to translation. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the use of phraseological units in one of the most representative genres in the field, i.e. wine technical sheets, with a view to assisting translators in the comprehension and management of oenology-related texts. A contrastive analysis was carried out using an English-Spanish comparable corpus in order to identify and classify phraseological units according to their function and semantic characteristics; further analysis of the distribution of these units allowed us to define the rhetorical structure of wine technical sheets. The study evidenced the high frequency and complexity of phraseological units in the genre. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"This paper conducts a speculative examination of how AI image synthesisers, which generate novel imagery in response to inputted textual prompts–such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion–can be employed reflexively to investigate cultural representations of machine vision technologies. Such work can be framed methodologically as a form of ‘critical image synthesis’: the prompting of imagery that variously interrogates and makes visible the structural biases and cultural imperatives encoded within their originating architectures. In framing AI image synthesisers as an inverted form of machine vision–as generating, rather than classifying imagery through text–an opportunity is afforded to consider how they reflexively characterise themselves within their own latent spaces of representational possibility. Specifically, what kinds of imagery do these systems yield in response to prompts centring on keywords associated with machine vision technologies? And what does this reveal concerning how machine vision is represented and characterised across wider culture? This paper will empirically analyse a selection of prompted outputs from Stable Diffusion V2, treating them as a speculative mapping of contemporary visual themes and imaginaries surrounding machine vision technologies. This paper will then conclude by placing these outputs into dialogue with the author’s own creative practices involving machine vision, generating new image-text combinations that aim to provoke speculative analyses along alternative critical vectors. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Objective. The aim of this review was to identify reported nursing-sensitive outcomes in the Emergency Department to date. Methods. An Umbrella review was conducted. Four databases, CINAHL, Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus, were searched from inception until October 2022. MeSH terms were: “nursing”, “sensitivity and specificity”, “emergency service, hospital”, “nursing care”. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the inclusion criteria for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality with the SIGN tool. Results of the included studies were summarized and described in themes for narrative analysis. The study was enrolled in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42022376941) and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results. The search strategy yielded 2289 records. After duplicate removal, title, abstract and full-text eligibility screening, nine systematic reviews were included in the review. A total of 35 nursing-sensitive outcomes were reported. The most described outcomes were waiting times, patient satisfaction and time to treatment. The less measured were mortality, left without being seen and physical function. Synthesizing nursing-sensitive outcomes in themes for reporting, the most measured outcomes were within the safety domain (n=20), followed by the clinical (n=9), perceptual (n=5) and the least explored functional domain (n=1). Conclusion. Nursing sensitive outcomes research in emergency nursing practice is a conceptual challenge still in its early stage. Several nursing-sensitive outcomes were identified in this review that can evaluate the contribution of emergency department nursing care to patient outcomes. Further research is required to explore patient outcomes sensitive to emergency nursing care. © https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0"
"War linguistics has described the texts forming the language picture of war. The subject of the study are the basic characteristics of this direction of research, the main objective of which is a comprehensive study and description of the lexicon, thesaurus and war pragmatics, implemented in the texts of different types – from the law texts to social networks discussions. The methodological basis of the study is the notion of language as an alienated reality, which embodies the war realities. The methodology of the war linguistics is the methods combination of sociolinguistics, lexicology, stylistics, discоursоlogy, lexicography: methods of continuous sampling, questionnaires, interviews, discourse analysis, lexicography, etc. The distinction has been made between general war linguistics, which describes the global linguistic means of implementing the tactics of perception and influence on the masses, and local linguistics, associated with specific armed conflicts. There should be differentiated texts produced by war organizers, ideologists and propagandists (agents texts), on the one hand, and participants and victims of war (recipients texts), on the other one. Data from the war linguistics study can be used in propaganda and counterpropaganda, legal and social assessment of the military conflicts realities. © Siberian Federal University.

"In the second half of the 11th century, having completed the political conquest of England, William I undertook to establish control over the local church. To do this, he initiated a religious reform in his new possessions, which was led by the Archbishop of Canterbury Lanfranc (1070–1089) and his followers. This reform, directed against the “old” clergy, endangered the position of many religious centers associated with local cults. The reaction to it was the emergence of a wave of hagiographic literature, designed to legitimize both the cult itself and the status of the community representing the saint. The article is devoted to the analysis of the main features and assessment of the political role of hagiography of the late 11th — early 12th centuries, based on the case of the Lives of St. David and St. Beuno, which were directed against the reforms of both Lanfranc and his successors. From the beginning of the 12th to the beginning of the 13th century the appeal to the image of St. David and his Life were the main tools of the bishops of St. Davids in their struggle to gain the status of an archbishopric, which would remove the issue of the subordination of the Welsh clergy to Canterbury. Each stage of the confrontation was accompanied by the appearance of a new edition of the text. The Life of St. Beuno, which displayed signs of actualization at the beginning of the 12th century, expressed the fear of local religious communities to lose part of their income due to active hostilities in East of Wales. Despite all the efforts of the Welsh clergy, by the end of the 13th century the influence of the king of England and English church hierarchs on local dioceses was already unquestionable. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"To explore the role of policy in developing the film and animation industry to better utilize the service function of animation industry policies. This paper constructs a two-dimensional analysis model of the policy, selects and codes the policy text, and uses it as the explanatory variable in multiple linear regression. At the same time, the comprehensive evaluation of the development level of the film and animation industry was selected as the explanatory variable, the index system was constructed by using the diamond theory, and the public factors and weights of the evaluation were determined based on the factor analysis method. Finally, a regression equation was established through multiple regression analysis to explore the influence of policies on the production and revenue of film and television animation and product quality, and the correlation coefficients of the regression equation were determined. Implementing the film and television animation policy resulted in a 56.8% increase in the industry's main business revenue. At the 0.05 level, the effect was statistically and economically significant.  © 2023 Jingya Yue et al., published by Sciendo."
"Training community engaged climate adaptation leaders requires developing learners' thinking skills so they can flexibly approach adaptation planning and problem solving in novel socio-ecological contexts. In this text, we describe how multiple case study analysis helps adult learners in both formal and community education settings develop the thinking skills necessary for adaptation work, including analogical reasoning and knowledge transfer; and we illustrate how to organize multiple case analysis on shared critical competencies aligned to community needs. The article concludes with a discussion of three instructional best practices for employing multiple case analysis in educational settings and a discussion of how this educational approach can guide training programs and funding priorities.

"Literary translation has been widely discussed in modern translation studies because it presents diverse problems, including linguistic and cultural aspects so inherent during the translation process. The mistranslation of socio-cultural expressions is one such issue. This study investigates and analyses the techniques used in translating the Arabic socio-cultural expressions that appear in Ibrahim al-Koni’s Nazi:f al-Hajar, which was published in 1992; and its English translation, The Bleeding of the Stone, published in 2002 by May Jayyusi and Christopher Tingley. In the study, a comparison between the source text (Arabic) and the target text (English) was undertaken to observe the quality of the translation via adopting House’s (1997) model for translation quality assessment, and thereby identify the techniques being used. Some problems were noted in the translation of Arabic socio-cultural expressions into English. These problems were attributed to the cultural differences between Arabic and English, as evidenced by the unrecognisability of certain socio-cultural expressions in the source language and their nonexistence in the receptor culture, as well as the non-use of certain translation techniques. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Event extraction stands as a significant endeavor within the realm of information extraction, aspiring to automatically extract structured event information from vast volumes of unstructured text. Extracting event elements from multi-modal data remains a challenging task due to the presence of a large number of images and overlapping event elements in the data. Although researchers have proposed various methods to accomplish this task, most existing event extraction models cannot address these challenges because they are only applicable to text scenarios. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal event extraction method based on knowledge fusion. Specifically, for event-type recognition, we use a meticulous pipeline approach that integrates multiple pre-trained models. This approach enables a more comprehensive capture of the multidimensional event semantic features present in military texts, thereby enhancing the interconnectedness of information between trigger words and events. For event element extraction, we propose a method for constructing a priori templates that combine event types with corresponding trigger words. This approach facilitates the acquisition of fine-grained input samples containing event trigger words, thus enabling the model to understand the semantic relationships between elements in greater depth. Furthermore, a fusion method for spatial mapping of textual event elements and image elements is proposed to reduce the category number overload and effectively achieve multi-modal knowledge fusion. The experimental results based on the CCKS 2022 dataset show that our method has achieved competitive results, with a comprehensive evaluation value F1-score of 53.4% for the model. These results validate the effectiveness of our method in extracting event elements from multi-modal data. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved."
"Topic models are a class of unsupervised learning algorithms for detecting the semantic structure within a text corpus. Together with a subsequent dimensionality reduction algorithm, topic models can be used for deriving spatializations for text corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots, reflecting semantic similarity between the documents and supporting corpus analysis. Although the choice of the topic model, the dimensionality reduction, and their underlying hyperparameters significantly impact the resulting layout, it is unknown which particular combinations result in high-quality layouts with respect to accuracy and perception metrics. To investigate the effectiveness of topic models and dimensionality reduction methods for the spatialization of corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots (or basis for landscape-type visualizations), we present a large-scale, benchmark-based computational evaluation. Our evaluation consists of (1) a set of corpora, (2) a set of layout algorithms that are combinations of topic models and dimensionality reductions, and (3) quality metrics for quantifying the resulting layout. The corpora are given as document-term matrices, and each document is assigned to a thematic class. The chosen metrics quantify the preservation of local and global properties and the perceptual effectiveness of the two-dimensional scatter plots. By evaluating the benchmark on a computing cluster, we derived a multivariate dataset with over 45 000 individual layouts and corresponding quality metrics. Based on the results, we propose guidelines for the effective design of text spatializations that are based on topic models and dimensionality reductions. As a main result, we show that interpretable topic models are beneficial for capturing the structure of text corpora. We furthermore recommend the use of t-SNE as a subsequent dimensionality reduction. IEEE"
"We analyzed the essays that were written on various topics in an introductory physics course using two unsupervised machine learning algorithms. One of them was Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This algorithm is used for extracting abstract topics from a collection of text documents. The other algorithm was Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). It is used for similar purposes but also in other domains such as image recognition. We applied these two algorithms to the dataset that consisted of N = 683 student essays. Although there were some built-in, important differences between LDA and NMF, they both found similar topics in our data by large. This offers instructors a promising and productive way of accessing useful information about their students' written work, especially in large-enrollment classes. © 2023, American Association of Physics Teachers.

"The following article addresses the question of why, despite a handful of certain overlapping interests, the U.S and Russia ultimately failed to reach a compromise during their negotiations at the start of the Ukrainian crisis. We aim to reveal the effects of competing national security narratives from both the United States and Russia, and its role in the deterioration of these relations. Though the current crisis in U.S. – Russia relations has been sometime in the making, it became particularly evident in the context of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Based on paradigmatic narrative interpretations, a qualitative text analysis, and a comparative analysis, we examine the two main aspects of the counties’ competing narratives: “national security storytelling” and state “threat perception”. We argue that due to their antagonistic identities, competing worldviews, and equally posing threat perceptions, these narratives have damaged the possibility to overcome contradictions between the United States and Russia. In the long term, these competing narratives may create the preconditions for a systemic confrontation between the countries in world politics. © 2023 Brill Academic Publishers.

"Purpose – The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in the decision-making process of cruise travelers based on value perceptions. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of travelers seeking information online, and pre-decision, purchase decision, and post-sharing were analyzed to draw implications. Design/Methodology/Approach – The research methodology of this paper is as follows. A survey was conducted among potential travelers who are planning a cruise trip, especially those who are exposed to the digital environment and make pre-trip research and purchase decisions online. After conducting factor analysis for each factor, the relationship between variables was verified through MANOVA. In addition, cluster analysis was used to check for differences between groups and to determine whether there were differences between groups for each variable. Findings – As a result of the study, we were able to divide the clusters into three groups: low-, medium-, and high-value. For each cluster, we analyzed the difference in preference for digital tourism platforms at different stages of the cruise decision-making process. The results are reported in detail in the main text. Research Implications – While previous studies have conducted empirical research by incorporating theories on the traveler purchase decision-making process, this study is significant in that it analyzes the differences between groups of digital travelers as they increasingly make purchases online. It is expected to show theoretical and practical implications. © 2023 International Academy of Global Business and Trade. All rights reserved."
"A recommender system is a type of information filtering system that predicts and recommends items or products to users based on their preferences and past behaviors. It is commonly used in e-commerce and social media to suggest items that a user may be interested in purchasing, reading, watching, or listening to. Sentiment analysis is an area of natural language processing that has emerged as a popular way for organizations to detect and categorize opinions about a product, idea, or service. In recent years, many attempts have been made to apply sentiment analysis in designing recommender systems, in order to recommend various items, such as hotels. It is thought that providing a quality hotel suggestion based on the requirements and preferences of users is a challenge and, naturally, an alluring effort for tourism applications. In this paper, the quality of decision making for hotel recommender systems based on sentiment analysis, deep learning, and data balancing techniques has been improving. Multiple approaches are used with our proposed system to provide high-quality hotel recommendations. To achieve this goal, first, the existing dataset is balanced, using the translating and text paraphrasing policy by a transformer-based model called T5. Afterwards, an integrated method, including the transformer-based XLM-RoBERTa model is used along with the attention mechanism for sentiment analysis. The result of the comparison of our proposed model with the four best non-transformer-based models; RNN, GRU, LSTM, Bi-LST, and the most recent transformer-based model, En-RFBERT, on the TripAdvisor dataset, showed the superiority of our proposed method. Our proposed system beats En-RFBERT by 3%, 7%, and 5% in Macro Precision, Recall, and F1-score, respectively, and performs better than En-RFBERT when it comes to responsiveness time. © 2023 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

"The aim of the article is both to describe the competition folk tale and to attempt to answer the question whether it is a new form of folklore. The material basis for the considerations are the texts sent to the ethnological competitions announced in the years 1955–1966 by Maria Znamierowska-Prüfferowa Ethnographic Museum in Toruń, the Polish Ethnological Society, Toruń Branch, the and Polish Radio in Bydgoszcz. Out of over 6,500 submitted texts, the analysis includes only fairy tales (over 350) which, according to the assumptions of the organizers of the competitions (of which there were 6 in total), were to be a record of traditional peasant texts. Selected stories, mostly realisations of well-known threads described in the Polish folk tale in a systematic order by Julian Krzyżanowski, were analysed, extracting from them common and distinct features in relation to earlier folk texts, in order to characterise the new phenomenon, i.e. competition folk tale. © 2023 European Mathematical Society."
"A thorough digital picture of our world has been created as a result of the information environment's rapid growth, which has completely changed how we view and interact with reality.This revolutionary advancement has created opportunities for precise quantitative evaluation of the online social milieu. In this study, we sought to learn more about the online information background of college students who actively participate in extracurricular and academic activities regarded as very valuable by their individual institutions. To accomplish our goal, we created a sophisticated algorithm that can evaluate how closely an applicant's information background vector resembles that of the current student group. We want to uncover possible university candidate accounts on the VK social network by using this cutting-edge analytic technology, thereby improving the effectiveness of the admissions process. In addition to being a priceless tool for evaluating the digital world, our mathematical approach to processing internet data shows potential for reaching other socially relevant goals. This approach unlocks novel opportunities for creating tools that can effectively evaluate the digital landscape, offering substantial benefits across diverse fields. By leveraging the power of mathematical evaluation, we can make informed decisions, gain insights, and drive progress in this increasingly interconnected world. In addition, this mathematical evaluation could also lead to informed decision-making, drive progress, and facilitate advancements in a wide range of socially significant endeavors within the rapidly evolving information environment. © (2023).

"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures were implemented across the globe. These measures demanded replacing taken-for-granted social practices such as shaking hands with new interaction rituals. Based on our personal observations, this collective process of learning new interactions often resulted in feelings of awkwardness. Awkwardness, in this sense, is more than an individual emotion; it is also a cultural marker helping us understand how interactions, interaction rituals and social norms are constituted. Therefore, we aim to obtain a better understanding of both what people perceive as failed interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they perceive these awkward moments. We do so by looking at how awkwardness is discussed in social and news media during the first wave of the pandemic. Combining a topic modelling of tweets and a thematic text analysis of news articles, we show the main topics representing awkwardness in relation to COVID-19, and how this links to new forms of face-to-face and mediated interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that experiences of awkwardness often relate to the necessity of bodily and situational co-presence, creating a stronger sense of intimacy, synchronicity and sequency. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: The incidence of chronic diseases in children is increasing worldwide, which can disrupt the quality of life. Family empowerment (FE) is one approach to strengthen family care among children with chronic diseases. In addition, internet has the potential in healthcare service interventions for families. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of internet-based family empowerment interventions among children with chronic diseases. Methods: The study used a mixed-methods systematic review. A literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL databases. We used the PCC framework: chronic diseases (Population), family empowerment (Concept), and internet-based intervention (Context). Studies were eligible if published between 2013 and 2023, full-text, original study design, and focused on family empowerment in children with chronic diseases. Studies would be excluded if they were not in English or if the population was adults. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018. The study analysis used Sequential Explanatory Synthesis, which is a quantitative study (QUAN) synthesis followed by a qualitative study (QUAL) synthesis, then integrated using the QUAL data transformation technique. Results: We highlight the quantitative study findings that an internet-based family empowerment intervention positively impacted family members’ ability to care for children with chronic diseases with a mean Family Empowerment Scale (FES) total score of 4.13. We analyzed six study and identified four themes regarding efficacy of internet-based interventions in empowering families with children with chronic diseases: knowledge; availability of resources and time-saving; connectedness and communication; and family management and self-confidence. Conclusion: Our study highlights that online-based interventions in family empowerment positively impact enhancing all domains of empowerment. This findings suggest that internet-based family interventions need to be adopted to fulfill the care needs of children with chronic diseases sustainably. © 2023 Mulyana et al."
"Purpose: The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess the factual accuracy, completeness of medical information, and potential harmfulness of incorrect conclusions by medical professionals in automatically generated texts of varying complexity (1) using ChatGPT, Furthermore, patients without a medical background were asked to evaluate comprehensibility, information density, and conclusion possibilities (2). Methods: In the study, five different simplified versions of MRI findings of the knee of different complexity (A: simple, B: moderate, C: complex) were each created using ChatGPT. Subsequently, a group of four medical professionals (two orthopedic surgeons and two radiologists) and a group of 20 consecutive patients evaluated the created reports. For this purpose, all participants received a group of simplified reports (simple, moderate, and severe) at intervals of 1 week each for their respective evaluation using a specific questionnaire. Each questionnaire consisted of the original report, the simplified report, and a series of statements to assess the quality of the simplified reports. Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with a five-point Likert scale. Results: The evaluation of the medical specialists showed that the findings produced were consistent in quality depending on their complexity. Factual correctness, reproduction of relevant information and comprehensibility for patients were rated on average as “Agree”. The question about possible harm resulted in an average of “Disagree”. The evaluation of patients also revealed consistent quality of reports, depending on complexity. Simplicity of word choice and sentence structure was rated “Agree” on average, with significant differences between simple and complex findings (p = 0.0039) as well as between moderate and complex findings (p = 0.0222). Participants reported being significantly better at knowing what the text was about (p = 0.001) and drawing the correct conclusions the more simplified the report of findings was (p = 0.013829). The question of whether the text informed them as well as a healthcare professional was answered as “Neutral” across all findings. Conclusion: By using ChatGPT, MRI reports can be simplified automatically with consistent quality so that the relevant information is understandable to patients. However, a report generated in this way does not replace a thorough discussion between specialist and patient. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022–2023. OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports, which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon-and rule-based language models. As expected, most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, for which I discuss potential causes. Together, this study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of special-ized scientific texts. As a proof of concept, I show that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equita-bility in scientific publishing. © 2023, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

"The role of context in cloze tests has long been seen as both a benefit as well as a complication in their usefulness as a measure of second language comprehension (Brown, 2013). Passage cohesion, in particular, would seem to have a relevant and important effect on the degree to which cloze items function and the interpretability of performances (Brown, 1983; Dastjerdi & Talebinezhad, 2006; Oller & Jonz, 1994). With recent evidence showing that cloze items can require examinees to access information at both the sentence and passage level (Trace, 2020), it's worthwhile to now look back and examine the relationship between aspects of passage cohesion-referential cohesion, semantic overlap, and incidence of conjunctives-and item difficulty by classification. The current study draws upon a large pool of cloze test passages and items (k = 377) originally used by Brown (1993) along with automated text analysis of cohesion (Coh-Metrix, McNamara et al., 2014) to examine the impact of passage cohesion on item function. Correlations, factor analysis, and linear regression point to clear though minimal differences for both sentential and intersentential items as they relate to aspects of passage cohesion, the results of which may inform future test design and interpretation of cloze performance. © 2023 European Knowledge Development (EUROKD).

"Recently, much effort has gone into developing travel technology aids in indoor scenes, intending to increase the autonomy and quality of life of partially sighted or visually impaired (PSVI) people. However, existing indoor navigation methods require accurate prior maps. Yet, such maps are not always available and often difficult for people, especially the PSVI, to acquire or construct on site in real-time. To tackle such important issue, this work proposes a topological semantic mapping method for the PSVI such that they can well navigate such indoor environment as hospitals. The distinctive feature of this approach is its utilization of nonstandard floor plans, which can be easily obtained from real-world settings, as the primary data source. The proposed method that generating a sparse topological semantic map (TSM) from a floor plan includes: 1) preprocessing of captured floor plan images to extract a map area and correct a map view; 2) segmentation of an accessible area through a proposed text-based unsupervised image segmentation (TUIS) network; and 3) node calculation and semantic matching. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the constructed TSM as well as TUIS's superiority to existing methods.  © 1963-2012 IEEE."
"This study delved into cross-platform information flow and multilingual text analysis by examining social media posts on Weibo and Twitter in Chinese and English. We investigated public opinions about a violent restaurant attack in China that received widespread attention and validated three strategies of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify multilingual social media posts regarding their attitudes, targets, and frames. This study found that there was more criticism than support on Twitter than on Weibo when calling for social justice. When targeting the governments, Weibo users focused more on the local level, while Twitter users focused more on the state level. When framing their opinions, Weibo users focused more on gender violence, while Twitter users focused more on gang violence. These variations within social media posts across platforms were fundamentally influenced by the interruption of transnational information flow as a result of Chinese governance and censorship of the internet. Through the “porous censorship,” social media users’ autonomy and trust in the government played critical roles in the dynamics between online criticism and authoritarian responsiveness. © The authors."
"Background: Organophosphate (OP) pesticides have been associated with a decline in semen quality, although there are still considerable arguments about the magnitude of the association. Objective: This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impacts of OP pesticides on semen quality and male reproductive hormones. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols. Strategic search was conducted using combined text words as search terms. The eligibility criteria were developed based on Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study designs (PECOS) framework. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias was evaluated by The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group guidelines. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager. Results: A total of 766 male subjects (349 exposed to OP pesticides and 417 unexposed controls) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the ejaculate volume, seminal fluid volume, sperm multiple anomaly index, sperm, and leukocytes levels of the OP-exposed subjects compared to the control. In addition, OP pesticides exposure did not significantly affect serum concentrations of FSH, LH, and testosterone in subjects who were exposed to OP pesticides compared to their unexposed counterparts. However, we found a significant reduction in the sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive sperm motility, total sperm motility, and normal sperm morphology of OP pesticides-exposed subjects compared to the unexposed subjects. However, after subtype and sensitivity analyses, exposure to OP pesticides did not reduce sperm count. Also, after sensitivity analysis, OP pesticides exposure did not alter progressive sperm motility. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that OP pesticides exposure reduced sperm count, concentration, total and progressive motility, and normal sperm morphology, possibly via a testosterone-independent mechanism.

"The article deals with national cultural values and traditional virtues as the basis of the national idea of “Chinese dream”, an analysis of the ways to implement these grounds in public service announcements dedicated to the “Chinese dream” was also carried out. The subject of our study was public service announcements about the “Chinese dream”, the goal is to study the synthesis of the system of moral values and Chinese archetypes as a way to create public service announcements about the “Chinese dream”. The method of studying polycode texts included determining the main semantic components of the ideologeme “Chinese dream” and the relationship between verbal and non-verbal components in order to find out the dominant component in the perception of one or another polycode text of public service announcements. The material of the study was examples of public service announcements with the concept of “Chinese dream”, presented on the Internet. After analyzing the system of moral values, mainly represented by traditional Confucian virtues, as well as Chinese archetypes and forms of their visual representation in public service announcements, we made the conclusions about the ratio of verbal and non-verbal components in public service announcements dedicated to the “Chinese dream”. The results obtained give an idea of the system of codifications used to form behavioral attitudes through public service announcements, which is necessary for the correct interpretation of public service announcements as a communication process. © Siberian Federal University.

"The circulation of historical books has always been an area of interest for historians. However, the data used to represent the journey of a book across different places and times can be difficult for domain experts to digest due to buried geographical and chronological features within text-based presentations. This situation provides an opportunity for collaboration between visualization researchers and historians. This paper describes a design study where a variant of the Nine-Stage Framework [46] was employed to develop a Visual Analytics (VA) tool called DanteExploreVis. This tool was designed to aid domain experts in exploring, explaining, and presenting book trade data from multiple perspectives. We discuss the design choices made and how each panel in the interface meets the domain requirements. We also present the results of a qualitative evaluation conducted with domain experts. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the development of a VA tool to support domain experts in exploring, explaining, and presenting book trade data; 2) a comprehensive documentation of the iterative design, development, and evaluation process following the variant Nine-Stage Framework; 3) a summary of the insights gained and lessons learned from this design study in the context of the humanities field; and 4) reflections on how our approach could be applied in a more generalizable way.

"Financial reports serve as crucial resources for investors and researchers, providing analysts&#x2019; assessments of stocks that play a vital role in stock market applications. However, detecting analysts&#x2019; opinions and sentiments in financial reports is challenging. First, the formal and professional language used in these reports makes it difficult for previous methods to comprehend domain-specific knowledge. Second, financial reports often adopt lengthy and elaborate expressions to convey rich semantics, which exposes the existing methods to contextual information loss, especially on long-term dependencies. To address these problems, we propose a summary-enhanced hierarchical framework (SEHF), which leverages summary information to enhance financial report sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates financial bidirectional and auto-regressive transformer (FinBART), equipped with extended position encoding to summarize lengthy report articles and capture long-range interactions. To mitigate information loss, we initially divide each report into segments and then propose the hierarchical analyst sentiment representation network (ASRN), which utilizes financial bidirectional encoder representation from transformer (FinBERT), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)-Attention, and dendrite (DD) network to fuse information in the generated summary and report segments. Notably, FinBART and FinBERT are pretrained on large-scale financial corpora to effectively understand professional expressions. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset large-scale Chinese financial report (LCFR) for the lack of supervised datasets. Experimental results on LCFR and a benchmark dataset show that SEHF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and the ablation study highlights the effectiveness of aggregating sentiment information in the summary and report segments.

"The article focuses on the morphological features of the first manuscript translations of the Gospel of John made at the beginning of the 19th century. The aim of the study is to determine the dialect basis of these sources. The paper describes the main grammatical categories of the noun (number, possessiveness, case) and verb (voice, mood, tense) as well as non-finite forms of the verb (infinitive, participle, gerund). The study is based on the corpus of handwritten texts that includes the first Udmurt translations of the Gospel of John, stored in the St. Petersburg branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences and in the Russian State Historical Archive. The analysis has been carried out by comparing the linguistic data collected from the sources with the Udmurt literary language and its dialects in order to determine the innovative or archaic nature of the features identified in the sources under analysis. The analysis reveals a number of innovations, which indicate the dialect affiliation of the written records. The correlation of these features with modern Udmurt dialects suggests that the Upper-Cheptsa and Middle-Cheptsa dialects of the Northern dialect are the basis of the manuscripts. The sources also witness to a number of archaisms, which today can no longer be found in the Northern Udmurt dialects. In addition, in the texts under analysis, as well as in other written sources of this period, the spelling norm can clearly be traced, according to which the morphological indicators with an и initial are attached to stems ending in vowels and soft consonants, and in other cases the ы formants are used. © 2023 Institute of Linguistic.

"With the expansion of social networks, sentiment analysis has become one of the hot topics in machine learning. However, in traditional sentiment analysis, the text is considered of a general nature and ignores the different aspects that may exist in the text. This paper presents a hybrid model of transfer deep learning methods for the aspect-oriented sentiment analysis of influencers' tweets to predict the trend of cryptocurrencies. In the first model, different aspects of tweets are extracted using the Concept Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Concept-LDA). Then, by using the pre-Trained RoBERTa network and combining it with the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) deep learning network and attention layer, sentiments of different aspects of tweets are determined. In the following, the price trend of seven cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana, is determined using the historical price and the polarity of tweets with BiGRU combined deep neural network and the attention layer. Also, we used the gridsearch method to select dropout hyper-parameters, learning rate, and the number of GRU units, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) criterion confirmed the results of this proposed combination. The results show that the proposed model in the aspect-based sentiment analysis section has been able to achieve 5.94% accuracy and 9.9% improvement in the f1-score on the SemEval 2015 dataset and 2.61% improvement on the SemEval 2016 dataset in f1-score compared to the state-of-Arts. Also, the results of predicting the price trend of cryptocurrencies show that the proposed model has correctly recognized the price trend in the next five days in 77% of cases according to the ROC-AUC criterion.  © 2013 IEEE."
"This research provides a comprehensive analysis of deontic expressions within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, specifically focusing on obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and dispensations. Utilizing SHAMROQ, a systematic and rigorous methodology, the authors extract, classify, and analyze these expressions, quantify their prevalence, and identify common linguistic patterns within the legal text. The results show that obligations (71.3%) form most deontic expressions in CFR 48, indicating the heavily prescriptive nature of the document. Permissions also form a significant part (21.9%), suggesting the liberties and allowances are embedded within the regulatory framework. In contrast, prohibitions (5.4%) and dispensations (1.4%) are less frequent, indicating that the document leans more towards defining what is required or allowed rather than what is explicitly forbidden or exempted. This research also highlights the challenges encountered during the extraction process, providing insights into the complexities of parsing legal texts and the intricacies of deontic language. These challenges range from the technical difficulties of parsing a complex hierarchical document to the conceptual challenges of defining precise rulesets for regulations and provisions.

So, people of Odisha staying inside or outside Odisha are also expressing their opinion in Odia language text through different online blogs, review sites, social networking sites etc. Natural Language researchers are now working on these opinions to extract the actual sentiment of people hidden inside these opinions. More than 67% of works are based on machine learning and deep learning. Rarely 29% are only lexicon and context based because the development of lexicon is little bit difficult and time consuming. However, the lexical based gives more accurate result as compared to machine learning approach. As the opinion is much deeper than surface meaning, there is need of contextual analysis of opinion statements. In this paper we have designed a context based model named SOLMAT-A Neoteric Contextual Model for Odia Language Understanding to understand contextual meaning of the object statement for which opinion is called by identifying objects on which the opinion is based on, the action performed by or on the object, type, time of action(Present, Past, Future) and the type of statement( positive, negative or neutral) before forecasting the opinion.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
"The Latin Psalter from the Chudov monastery, written in Cyrillic letters around the end of the 15th century, is a document of paramount importance for the study of the Latin cultural tradition in Muscovy. This unique manuscript seems to be linked to the fervent translation activity directed by the archbishop of Novgorod Gennadii (1484–1504). The wide space left between the lines of the main Latin text was without doubt supposed to be filled with the Church Slavic corresponding text. A Slavic “translation” was indeed inserted into the biblical cantica and other texts, among which the hymn Te Deum, traditionally (and wrongly) considered to be a joint composition by Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine, which was very widespread in the Western Church. The article features the first diplomatic interlinear edition of the Slavic-Latin Te Deum, which is preceded by a short description and analysis of the Slavic text and its main linguistic peculiarities in comparison with another translation of the same work, made some decades later by Dmitry Gerasimov. Here all relevant differences between the two Slavic versions, both at the lexical and grammatical levels, are presented and shortly discussed. Further, some evident errors in the Slavic text of the Chudov Psalter cast some doubts on the possibility to consider it a real translation in the strict sense of the term; it seems rather to function as a lexico-grammatical interlinear gloss, to be read vertically as an auxiliary tool for a proper understanding of the Latin original.

"Sentiment analysis involves extracting sentiments from various forms of text, including customer reviews, tweets, blogs, and news clips expressing opinions on diverse subjects, even populist events. The advent of tools supporting regional languages has resulted in a substantial surge of regional language texts. As Hindi ranks fourth in terms of native speakers, the development of sentiment analysis mechanisms for Hindi text becomes crucial. This paper provides a comprehensive review of specific approaches used in Hindi sentiment analysis, encompassing negation handling and the evolution of SentiWordNet for the Hindi Language. Moreover, it offers an overview of available Hindi lexicons and insights into diverse stemmers and morphological analyzers designed for the language. Additionally, the paper conducts an in-depth literature review of various sentiment analysis tasks carried out in Hindi, thereby opening avenues for future research in sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the Hindi language. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The acquisition of autonomy is often implemented by the teachers who wish to be innovative through the pedagogical strategy of “learning pods”, which organizes the work of pupils in small groups. This chapter proposes to put this belief to the test by studying one such educational dispositif in French class (for 14- to 15-year-old pupils) in a secondary school located in the Paris region. We filmed a class devoted to the study of poems from the 19th and 20th centuries. Each of the six groups made up of four to five pupils dealt with a different poem, following the same instructions. We recorded and transcribed the teacher’s interventions and the discussions within the groups. We also collected the material handed out to the students and their written productions. Two weeks later, we conducted another interview with the teacher and 18 individual interviews with the pupils during which we confronted them with the various elements we had collected. We analysed the material in order to find out whether the pupils were autonomous and to what extent and how the three contracts that we had defined (the social, educational, and didactic contracts) played out. Our analysis leads us to believe that group work probably ensures a greater commitment to studying than more traditional systems do nowadays. It can also sustain the educational ideal of preparing the citizens of tomorrow in the classroom through respect for others and collaboration. However, the didactic contract doesn’t enable all the students to carry out an academic text commentary exercise independently or to become independent readers capable of turning the reading of literature into an authentic experience of personal development, like the teacher of our study would like it to be. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Judith Hangartner, Héloïse Durler, Regula Fankhauser and Crispin Girinshuti; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Introduction: While stigma toward autistic individuals has been well documented, less is known about how autism is perceived relative to other stigmatized disabilities. As a highly stigmatized condition with similar social cognitive features to autism, schizophrenia may offer a useful comparison for stigma. Previous studies have found that autistic people may be perceived more favorably than those with schizophrenia, but little is known about the underlying volitional thoughts that contribute to differences in how these conditions are perceived. Methods: The present study utilizes a mixed-methods approach, allowing for a detailed understanding of how young adults perceive different diagnostic labels. 533 college undergraduates completed questionnaires reflecting their perceptions of one of eight diagnostic labels: four related to autism (autism, autistic, autism spectrum disorder, or Asperger’s), two related to schizophrenia (schizophrenia or schizophrenic), and two related to an unspecified clinical condition (clinical diagnosis or clinical disorder). Participants also completed an open-ended question regarding their thoughts about, and exposure to, these labels. Responses were compared across broader diagnostic categories (autism, schizophrenia, general clinical condition), with thematic analysis used to assess the broader themes occurring within the open-ended text. Results: While perceptions did not differ significantly for person-first and identity-first language within labels, several differences were apparent across labels. Specifically, quantitative results indicated greater prejudice towards autism and schizophrenia than the generic clinical condition, with schizophrenia associated with more perceived fear and danger, as well as an increased preference for social distance, compared to autism. Patterns in initial codes differed across diagnostic labels, with greater variation in responses about autism than responses about schizophrenia or the general clinical condition. While participants described a range of attitudes toward autism (patronizing, exclusionary, and accepting) and schizophrenia (fear, prejudice, and empathy), they refrained from describing their attitudes toward the general clinical label, highlighting the centrality of a cohesive group identity for the development of stigma. Finally, participants reported a number of misconceptions about autism and schizophrenia, with many believing features such as savant syndrome to be core characteristics of the conditions. Conclusion: These findings offer a more detailed account of how non-autistic individuals view autism and may therefore aid in the development of targeted programs to improve attitudes toward autism.

"Designing new Smart City approaches complemented by modern technologies is always a very difficult and lengthy process. The implementation of these proposed Smart solutions into real operation is often even more difficult. This is due to the need to communicate with the political and municipal authorities concerned and, most importantly, with the citizens themselves. This communication is an important separate task that is often neglected, and it is this task that is the focus of this technical text. Since March 2022, a group of students and experts from the FTS have been working together to implement an area-wide project on the territory of the country called Transport Opportunities for Region 2050+ in the Czech Republic. This involves the creation of a transport vision for all 14 counties for the period 2050 and beyond, where the Faculty of Transportation Sciences is the principal investigator of the part with the working title: Student Workshop. The part carried out by the FTS aims to define the needs of the inhabitants of a given region in 2050 in the context of the sustainability of the development of the region, but especially the employability of young people in the region and their quality of life. Understanding transport in a broader context that is a key step towards building a functional transport system that meets the needs of citizens in line with economic sustainability and, above all, the development of the region. This task therefore corresponds exactly to the requirement for a correct and logical implementation of Smart solutions based on prior communication with the inhabitants of the area. © 2023 Kaunas University of Technology.

"This article analyzes the acceptance and perception of Israeli-Jewish culture in China through Chinese translation of ‘The Realist’. It points that most topics Chinese readers could interpret are those shared as general common sense or used in common terminology in all semiotic modes. However, the Israeli-Jewish tradition, literacy and specific practices remained unrecognised for the most part. It argues that the translator’s mediation of comic texts is grounded in processes of multimodal analysis that facilitates comprehension of whether and how a message is understood in a certain context. The translator has the task of making up the target readers’ contextual deficiency. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Pearl is a Middle English dream-poem in London, British Library, MS Cotton Nero A.x, of about 1400. It is attributed to the same author as the scriptural poems Patience and Cleanness and the romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight also found in this manuscript. The four texts provide abundant information on fourteenth-century social life, including religion, particularly for devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Analysis of Marian imagery in Pearl and its related poems thus tells us much on the attitudes to Christ's mother of a high-ranking provincial layman of about 1390, especially for her as 'Queen of Heaven' and 'Queen of Courtesy', the latter term denoting the values of court society. Such analysis also tends to confirm attribution on other grounds of the four poems to Sir John Stanley (d. 1414), a magnate and courtier who in the last thirty years of his life dominated the politics of the Lancashire-Cheshire region of north-west England. © 2023 Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Navarra.

"Patriarch Anastasius of Antioch was one of the most important religious leaders in the later sixth century. He left behind a substantial oeuvre, which focuses on Christology and Trinitarian theology. He was most comfortable with exegesis of Scripture but had a shaky grasp of philosophical terms and concepts that informed the debate was shaky. This was already seen by Günter Weiss who offered a detailed analysis of the texts. I concur with Weiss' judgement and limit myself to the discussion of aspects of Anastasius' speculation that he had not dealt with.  © 2023 Dirk Krausmuller."
"The physical types of equipment in the distribution network are diverse and the quantity is huge. This is because the distribution network requires a large number of various types of power supply and other auxiliary equipment such as substations to provide power supply services for electricity customers, resulting in a very rich and diverse data resources in the distribution network. Moreover, with the continuous integration of new energy sources, the distribution network has become increasingly complex, not only increasing the dimensions of operational management, but also facing huge challenges in data resource management. This paper proposes a unified management method for power distribution and new energy data resources, which manages a large number of non digital data and unstructured data such as file text in the distribution network in a unified manner, integrates heterogeneous data from different business systems, solves data quality problems caused by management, data processing and other reasons, meets the data management needs of power grid enterprises, and promotes Digital transformation of enterprises. On the basis of achieving unified management of data resources in the distribution network, the deep mechanisms between data resources are explored to reveal the operational laws and characteristics of the distribution network. At the same time, data analysis algorithms are used to mine distribution network data, design and implement distribution network business analysis functional modules, and upgrade distribution network data management from digitalization to intelligence. © 2023 SPIE."
"Background Online treatments are increasing in number and are currently available for a wide range of clinical problems. To date little is known about the role of treatment expectations and other placebo-like mechanisms in online settings compared to traditional face-to-face treatment. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed individual participant data from randomized clinical trials that compared online and face-to-face psychological interventions. Methods MEDLINE (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) were last searched on 2 February 2021. Randomized clinical trials of therapist guided online v. face-to-face psychological interventions for psychiatric or somatic conditions using a randomized controlled design were included. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of studies were independently screened by multiple observers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. Authors of the matching trials were contacted for individual participant data. Ratings from the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire and the primary outcome measure from each trial were used to estimate the association between expectation ratings and treatment outcomes in online v. face-to-face interventions, using a mixed-effects model. Results Of 7045 screened studies, 62 full-text articles were retrieved whereof six studies fulfilled the criteria and provided individual participant data (n = 491). Overall, CEQ ratings predicted clinical outcomes (β = 0.27) at end of treatment with no moderating effect of treatment modality (online v. face-to-face). Conclusions Online treatment appears to be equally susceptible to expectancy effects as face-to-face therapy. This furthers our understanding of the importance of placebo-like factors in online treatment and may aid the improvement of healthcare in online settings.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

"Thanks to their extensive use in Internet-based applications, ontologies have gained significant popularity and recognition within the semantic web domain. They are widely regarded as valuable sources of semantics and interoperability in artificial intelligence systems. With the exponential growth of unstructured data on the web, there is a pressing need for automated acquisition of ontologies from unstructured text. This research area has seen the emergence of various methodologies that leverage techniques from machine learning, text mining, knowledge representation and reasoning, information retrieval, and high level natural language processing. These new techniques represent an opportunity to introduce automation into the process of ontology acquisition from unstructured text. To this end, this contribution offers a semi-automatic framework with a concrete usage of a tooled NLP-based approach to design an application ontology in a real-world industrial context. We discuss the state of the art analysis, the challenges met and the technological choices for the realization of this approach. Specifically, we explore its application in the real-world scenario of RTE’s power grid event management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"In this paper, we examine how and why the European Commission's ideas on fiscal policy have changed over the course of the European Semester. Empirically, we rely on a semi-supervised scaling approach to identify economic ideas as they appear in Semester documents from the aftermath of the financial crisis onwards (2011-2022). Our findings demonstrate a gradual shift in ideas from an ordoliberal to a Keynesian direction, especially during the overlapping Von der Leyen and Covid-19 crisis years. We identify substantial country-specific differences throughout 2011–2022, with some countries receiving exclusively Keynesian recommendations, and others distinctively ordoliberal ones. These patterns can be explained in part by economic conditions in those member states but not by the public's trust in the EU. These results underscore the reactive nature of the Commission's economic ideology; crises, as well as member states’ economic conditions, shape the direction of its fiscal policy recommendations. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Out of 110 early printed Cyrillic liturgical Tetraevangelia, five were issued by the printing house of the Holy Dormition Pochaiv Lavra. All of them appeared in the 2nd half of the 18th century and were intended for the use in the Uniate, i.e. Greek-Catholic, Church. A text-critical study of different texts from various parts of Tetraevangelia has suggested that the Gospel edition issued in Kyiv in 1746 was used by printers in Pochaiv to prepare their first liturgical Tetraevangelion. This publication is devoted to the textual analysis of menologia present in early printed Cyrillic Tetraevangelia, with particular attention given to the saints and feasts, as well as verbatim correspondence of commemorations and liturgical rubrics. Its results allow to conclude that the first Tetraevangelion issued at the Holy Dormition Pochaiv Lavra in 1759, was prepared on the basis of the Gospel edition issued at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra in 1746. Liturgical rubrics in the first Pochaiv Tetraevangelion were adjusted to the liturgical tradition of the Greek-Catholic Church. Four further Pochaiv liturgical Gospel editions copied, with some minor corrections, the menologion of the first one. Copyright © 2023 Jerzy Ostapczuk. Published by Vilnius University Press."

"Madeleine de Scudéry defended in the real life and in your literary work the values of equality between men and women to education, to writing and to choose in matters of marriage and motherhood. The main female characters in her works asserted themselves as heroines of her own deeds and destiny. Towards the second half of the 17th century in France, her extensive novel Clélie, histoire romaine was a publishing success. In this article we will study some passages from this novel in which the main female characters debate the question of the condition of women and perform heroic acts, finally becoming Clélie herself the heroine of the novel. As an analysis strategy, we will apply a critical eye at the constructions on femininity that are present in the text. The conclusions reveal that the transposition between reality-fiction shows the emergence of a construction of femininity in which the role of women in literary life is gaining strength and constituting itself in favor of progress in issues of female empowerment in the women of the Revolution. © 2023 Biblioteca Universidad de Cordoba.

"Objective: This systematic review aims to identify the diagnostic accuracy of posterior circulation stroke (PCS) by paramedics and the causes and duration of delay in its recognition. Methods: A systematic search using CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed was performed. All databases were searched up to May 25, 2022. Studies were included where patients were adults, assessed by paramedics, and PCS was the primary diagnosis. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results have been described by proportions, and both sensitivity calculations and subgroup analysis were performed utilizing MedCalc. Results: A total of 797 titles/abstracts and a subsequent 87 full texts were screened, of which 15 were included. There were 5395 patients who were assessed by paramedics and had a confirmed diagnosis of PCS. Among five studies containing both true positive and false negative data, there were 98 (45.8%) true positives. PCS patients lost an average of 27 min (p < 0.001) compared to anterior stroke patients in the prehospital setting. One study revealed that educational intervention, including implementing the finger-to-nose test, increased the sensitivity for diagnosis from 45.8 to 74.1% (p = 0.039) and decreased the time from door to computed tomography from 62 to 41 min (p = 0.037). Conclusion: There is a substantial lack of evidence regarding the diagnosis of PCS by paramedics. Despite the low quality of evidence available, overall, the sensitivity for paramedic PCS diagnosis appears to be poor. Further investigation is required into paramedics’ diagnosis of PCS and the use of educational interventions.

"In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the leading rule-based information extraction systems in both research and industry, focusing on their main characteristics and their performance. Our evaluation was performed on a dataset of text documents about financial product descriptions from a real-world application scenario. In this study, we demonstrate that, while the considered tools share similarities in terms of expressiveness of their extractors and produce results of comparable quality, the implementation choices of their engines have a substantial impact on their overall execution time. Moreover, we emphasize that some of the considered tools offer seamless support for writing extraction rules, effectively addressing one of the common challenges associated with rule-based approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"A natural language processing method called sentiment analysis automatically detects and measures subjective information in text or audio data. It may be used in many different situations. However, due to the complexity of the Arabic language and the scarcity of labeled audio datasets, sentiment analysis on Arabic audio data poses particular difficulties. This study suggests a fresh method for analyzing Arabic sentiment in audio data utilizing machine learning and transformers. With the Count Vectorizer and n-gram techniques serving as the feature extractors, the objective is to assess the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms, such as AraBERT, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The suggested method seeks to achieve high accuracy in sentiment categorization by overcoming the difficulties of Arabic audio sentiment analysis. The study evaluates the proposed approach on a newly created Arabic audio dataset and compares the results with existing approaches. The obtained results in terms of Accuracy (ACC), Precision (PREC), and Recall (REC) show excellent results, with the proposed approach outperforming existing approaches. The discussion section analyzes the impact of different feature extraction methods and machine learning algorithms on the performance of the sentiment analysis model. The results show that the AraBERT model achieves the highest accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This study examines the importance of integration of pedagogy and technology in secondary science classroom of India in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers in this study focused on four types schools. Twenty-two teachers and eighty students have taken part in this research. Looking to the COVID-19 situation data is generated through telephonic contacts, e-mails and Google meets. Researchers used a mixed method and followed qualitative as well as quantitative data analysis. According to teachers from all four kinds of schools, technology is a necessary instrument for advancing education in the COVID-19 period. According to the study, factors influencing effective pedagogy and technology integration include necessary infrastructure, technical support, teacher training, supportive school management, skilled and motivated teachers etc. Integration of ICT with pedagogy makes learning engaging and entertaining. It encourages inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning, creative and critical thinking among students. It provides opportunity for students to receive materials in multiple formats like videos audio recordings, text materials etc. Though it facilitates individualized student paced learning, satisfying needs of diverse learners, but still not every sort of school uses the same technology. Poor attendance, face to face interaction, poor interconnectivity, health problems for teachers and students, are some of the obstacles encountered during online classes. In the light of 4th generation industrial revolution education system is going to be changed to adapt technological interventions in education. So, the educators and teachers need to be fully prepared to accept, learn and adapt the upcoming technological advancements. © Italian e-Learning Association."
"The use of case studies in some higher education programmes has been well established since the 1950s, particularly in those related to management and the health sciences. In the humanities, however, though the case study is an essential form of scientific inquiry, its introduction in the classroom is not as frequent. Moreover, the standard pedagogical use of the case study usually consists of the presentation of a case, in order to encourage creative thinking and develop solution-seeking strategies to an already concluded description of a real or hypothetical scenario. This paper discusses the potential benefits of asking higher education students to write their own case studies, a practice introduced in 2020 in the course units of French/German/Spanish Culture for Business II, of the MA in Intercultural Studies for Business lectured at ISCAP (Porto Polytechnic). Because of its emphasis on interpretation, case study writing may help students develop their skills in data collection and analysis, powers of observation, and critical thinking. In addition, due to the characteristics of this text type, skills in storytelling and creative writing may also be enhanced. After reviewing the pertinent literature on the subject, the authors illustrate some of the advantages of this teaching method by going through some actual examples of short case studies written by their students and already published. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Practitioners have emphasized the importance of employing sentiment analysis techniques in decision-making. The data utilized in this process is typically gathered from social media, making it somewhat unreliable for decision-making. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Text Quality (TQ) aspect to capture the characteristics of Twitter data streams. Our objective is to develop an automated approach that assists the user in assessing the quality of textual data. This is accomplished through a fuzzified classifier, which automatically identifies ambiguous and unambiguous text at both the syntactic and semantic levels. We present a software tool that captures real-time and batch Twitter data streams. This tool calculates their TQ and presents the outcomes through diverse graphical depictions. It also empowers users to customize the weights allocated to individual quality dimensions and metrics used in computing the overall data quality of a tweet. This flexibility enables customization of weights according to different analysis contexts and user profiles. To demonstrate the usability and value of our contributions, we conducted a case study focusing on the Covid-19 vaccine. A preliminary analysis shows that by removing ambiguous text, the accuracy of the deployed algorithms enhances. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"The rapid progress in deep learning has propelled transformer-based models to the forefront, establishing them as leading solutions for a multiple NLP tasks. These tasks span a wide spectrum, encompassing text classification activities like sentiment analysis, question answering, natural language inference, and news classification. Transformers offer numerous noteworthy benefits compared to alternative language modeling strategies. They possess a remarkable capacity for parallel processing, enabling them to handle multiple segments of a sequence concurrently, thereby significantly expediting both training and inference. Furthermore, transformers excel in capturing extensive contextual relationships within text, thereby enhancing their comprehension of the broader context and resulting in the generation of more logically coherent textual content. Additionally, transformers exhibit heightened adaptability and scalability, simplifying their utilization across various tasks. Hence, this review paper aims to analyze in-depth the most popular transformer techniques specifically applied to text classification tasks: the various BERT models. We also provide an overview of more than 109 research efforts that used various BERT models in text classification, determining the methodology used. In addition, we describe the three variants of the transformer model with an illustration of the most common models for each variant and the appropriate NLP tasks for each variant.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Depression is common in adolescence, and subthreshold symptoms even more so. Untreated, it is disabling. Yet, upscaling traditional clinic-based provision would be prohibitively expensive. We aimed to investigate frontline, non-specialist professionals’ use of and attitudes towards technology to increase the availability of early help. Method: Cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of professionals in the UK (N = 115, including low intensity practitioners, GPs, education staff, school nurses). The survey included rating scales and free text boxes. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and we used reflexive thematic analysis for the qualitative data. Results: Frontline professionals rate their technological competence as good and have favourable attitudes towards using technology to support adolescents with depression symptoms. They rated online resources as most useful with mild-moderate symptoms, compared to severe symptoms (t(110) = 14.54, p <.001, Cohen’s d = 1.49). Technology was viewed as important to bridge the needs-access gap and professionals were interested in learning about online SSIs due to usefulness (r =.32, p <.001). Conclusion: Technology, such as SSIs, are of interest to mental health professionals and may be useful for supporting adolescents with depression. Future research should explore the use of SSIs for treating adolescent depression. © The Author(s) 2023."

"Background: Undertaking voice and communication training is an important part of the gender-affirming journey for many trans, gender-diverse and non-binary individuals. Training supports the alignment of voice with gender identity helping to reduce gender dysphoria as individuals are better able to connect with their voices. However, for training to be effective, regular practice is needed and the demands of training can often be difficult to meet. Aims: To investigate the interest, attitudes and perspectives on the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to support gender-affirming voice and communication training by transgender, gender non-binary and gender-diverse people, and speech–language pathologists providing gender-affirming voice and communication training. Methods & Procedures: A mixed-methods survey (i.e., collecting quantitative data through multiple-choice question and qualitative data through free text questions) was hosted online from 23 August to 21 September 2021. A total of 17 questions asked about technology use, and attitudes and perspectives towards VR. The survey included video examples of three different voice-activated VR applications to prompt participant responses about the technology. Outcomes & Results: A total of 70 survey responses were included in the analysis. All participants had previous experience using smart phones, but only 27.2% had previously used VR. Four key themes were identified relating to potential uptake of VR in gender-affirming voice and communication training: (1) general audience appeal, (2) perceived therapeutic value, (3) exposure to or protection from harm and (4) relatability to real life. Conclusions & Implications: VR games may represent a viable option to support practice of voice exercises. Gamification through VR is likely to motivate some to increase frequency of practice. VR applications that are used in voice training need to be fit-for-purpose, and detailed co-design is necessary to build appropriate applications for future use. This study provides a foundation to inform the design, development and implementation of VR applications to be used in gender-affirming voice training. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject? Speech–language pathologists work closely with transgender and gender-diverse individuals to help them achieve gender congruent voice and communication. Clients need to undertake regular and ongoing practice outside of training sessions to achieve and maintain their ideal voice. Motivation and adherence to regular practice sessions remain an ongoing challenge. What this study adds to the existing knowledge This study explores the use of immersive VR technologies to create safe, motivating and enjoyable environments to encourage regular practice of gender-affirming voice and communication exercises. It engages stakeholders in an early-stage participant-involved design to gauge interest in, and perspectives on, VR and technology-based training support tools. The results suggest that voice-activated VR applications would highly motivate some individuals if they were appropriately designed but would not be ideal for all. What are the actual and clinical implications of this work? Immersion in VR can be a highly motivating tool to enhance adherence to practice schedules for some individuals. However, tools need to be specifically designed with outcomes in mind to be fit-for-purpose, to support individual goals and to minimize the risk of harm. The few existing VR voice-activated applications that are available require further assessment, and redesign through co-design with users to functionally and safely support gender-affirming voice and communication training. © 2023 The Authors.

"Based on the features and knowledge elements of the semantic network, this paper proposes a formal model of the semantic network of English ecological discourse and constructs an abstract description based on classification learners and reduced operation commands. In the formal description, the semantic features are extracted based on the sequence model, the text composition is completed based on the word relationship for the adaptive semantic network, and the hierarchical structure of the semantic network is constructed. By selecting English ecological news discourse data from mainstream news media in the United Kingdom and the United States and combining it with the adaptive semantic network, the subject of the discourse system is determined, and the characteristics of the title tone and modal verbs are analyzed. English ecological discourse has 115,000 modal verbs. Low-modal verbs reached 993,000, and high-modal verbs accounted for the smallest proportion, 516,000. The ecological characteristics of English news are revealed through the ecological discourse analysis of this paper. © 2023 Yuan Yuan, published by Sciendo 2023."
"We investigate the gender gap in issue attention among members of parliament (MPs) by applying automated text analytic techniques to a novel data set on Italian parliamentary speeches over a remarkably long period (1948-2020). We detect a gendered specialization across issues that tends to disappear as women's shares in parliamentary groups increase. We then investigate whether women's access to previously male-owned issues brings with it a different agenda, operationalized as a different vocabulary. We detect a U-shaped pattern: language gender specificity is high when female MPs are tokens in parliamentary groups with a large preponderance of men; it decreases when their shares start increasing and grows again when they constitute a considerable minority. We argue that this pattern is consistent with the theory of tokenism, and it is produced by the interlinkage of commitment to shared norms and the distribution of ""activation thresholds""among female MPs.  © 2023 The Author(s).

"With the rapid development of the field of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), the importance of Data Set(DS)labeling for training high-quality ABSA models has become increasingly prominent. In the past, the ABSA DS labeling task was usually handed over to crowd workers on the MTurk platform or expert classifiers, but with the development of Large Language Models(LLMs) in natural Language generation tasks, it shows great potential in data labeling. In this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis framework that automatically acquires labeled MOOC's DS to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and bias of LLMs in ABSA text analysis tasks compared to manual ones. The results show that ChatGPT is superior to humans in ABSA labeling tasks, the zero-sample accuracy and code-to-code consistency both exceed crowdsourced workers. These findings show that LLMs do have the potential to be used for dataset labeling tasks, and can provide a new feasible idea for future DS labeling research in the ABSA field. © 2023 IEEE."
"Jhumpa Lahiri’s translingual text In Other Words (In altre parole, 2015) functions in the article both as a test case to explore disciplinary boundaries and as a case study to examine the ‘trans’ prefix. Firstly, can the infrastructure of Italian Studies accommodate non-Italianist writers and researchers? What sort of conversations might a Transnational Italian Studies scholar have with a comparatist? Secondly, to what extent does Lahiri’s text merit the prefix ‘trans’, especially if we adopt Jessica Berman’s view of the ‘trans’ prefix as disruptive of the normative? An analysis of In Other Words focusing on four trans-prefixed terms–transnational, transgender, transvestite, and translation–reveals a tension between essentialised concepts of national belonging, gender, and language and more performative instances of the same. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The study demonstrates how the religious worldview of early modern humans influenced the formation of family values and relationships in the clergy families and the church. The paper is based on the analysis of religious texts that were the basis of the contemporary Orthodox idea of the ideal family, comparing them with notes on the daily life of religious figures of the early modern period, with archival sources. The thesis analyses the conflicts in priests’ families in Ukraine in the early modern society which was lenient concerning “dosed” violence by the father in the family. In this time period, the priest decided what the “normal” patterns of behavior were, ignoring or interpreting in his own way the instructions of the bishop and the canonical precepts. More than 7% of the priests were unable to resolve family quarrels on their own, and they moved to the public sphere for conflict resolution. The majority of these conflicts were between the son-in-law and mother-in-law of the priest. The least frequently reported conflicts were between the priest and his wife. The archival sources contained reports of conflicts involving every family member role. The disputes took place over material values and personal animosity, and within the context of “professional” activities, as family members often held all positions in the parish. © 2023, George Fox University Murdock Learning Resource Center.

"The general objective of this article is to propose a pedagogical model for teaching the subject of research methodology based on learning by doing. This particular case is aimed at new students entering higher education, most of whom are young or working people and need to learn at their own pace and needs. Among the authors consulted as theoretical references are: Pinto and Cortes 2017, Criollo et al. 2017, Pomar 2020, Sánchez and Vásquez 2021, Burgasi 2021, Hernández et al. 2022, Lamotte et al. 2009, among others of great relevance. On the other hand, the methodological process was approached through the quantitative approach under the descriptive and field design; the survey was used to collect the data in its respective content analysis that allows triangulating the information. The study sample consisted of university students who had taken the methodology course during the 2022–2023 academic year, with the purpose of measuring the following variables: previous notions in research; how to proceed in research; teaching–learning process in methodology. Among the most outstanding findings are that the students did not have basic notions in methodology; they presented deficiencies in the writing of the text; difficulties in delimiting the variables and the formulation of the objectives; which allows validating the requirement to propose a pedagogical model from the constructivist perspective and dialogic pedagogy for the development of research skills in the co-creation of an academic project. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"In this study, signal processing techniques such as baseband filters and the wavelet transform method are used to analyze specific patterns in EEG signals from patients with epilepsy, collected from the Siena Scalp database. The goal is to identify predictive indicators of epileptic seizures by analyzing three key points in the fast delta wave: 1) Normal brain activity, 2) Sudden increase in amplitude, and 3) A dead stop. The results obtained will be used for the implementation of an alert device based on the power threshold of the EEG signal, and the comparison of the measured values with the pre-established power threshold. If brain activity exceeds the threshold, the device could issue an alert or signal to indicate that a desired state has been reached or to signal an abnormal or worrisome condition. This text discusses the efficacy of visual analysis of preictal phases and electronic devices for detecting and predicting seizures. Although the study shows evidence for these methods, there were limitations, including a small sample size and the use of a single electronic device. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This paper firstly researches English text emotion expression and information communication, classifies English text emotion expression and information communication according to the human emotion-value relationship, and summarizes the characteristics of English emotion expression and information communication. Secondly, using artificial intelligence technology, it is proposed to construct an analysis model for English text emotion and information communication using the BiLSTM neural network. To deal with the characteristics of English text quickly and efficiently, it is necessary to encode the emotional information of English text, and based on encoding, the BiLSTM neural network is applied to extract the emotional features of English text and solve the problem of the loss of emotional features through the loss function. Then, the crawler tool is used to obtain the dataset from the Chinese English module under the MOOC of Chinese universities, and the evaluation indexes are set according to the model's performance, followed by the experimental analysis of the English text emotion expression and information conveyance. The results show that compared with the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM, the BiLSTM-based neural network performs better in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance, with the accuracy rate staying above 0.925, and the effect on the English dataset is a bit better than that on the Chinese dataset. This study aims to enhance English teaching and communication between Chinese and foreign cultures. © 2023 Jingbo Hao et al., published by Sciendo 2023."
"In the interwar period of 1920—1930s Prague was a recognized intellectual center of the Russia Abroad. The article analyzes the place occupied by the images of Prague and its historical heritage in the minds of Russian émigrés, how they constructed this images, how it was reflected in memoirs, letters, diaries, periodicals, scientific literature and fiction. The space of Prague was a special cultural text, formed at the intersection of various ethnic, religious and linguistic boundaries. For Russians, it was not just an urban space, but an active participant and witness to the historical process. In this regard, according to émigrés, few European cities could compare with it. The Prague urban space was perceived by Russians as the center of cultural symbols, among which a special place was given to famous architectural monuments — Charles Bridge, Prague Castle and the Church of St. Vitus, medieval streets of Malá Strana, etc. A special place is given to the analysis of the image of the Charles Bridge, which took on various guises. The bridge became an active figure, a practically protagonist of both artistic and scientific reflections. The article analyzes the influence of Prague images on the work of Russian émigrés such as Marina Tsvetaeva, Gleb Struve, Igor Severyanin, Valentin Bulgakov, Antony Florovsky, Sergey Pushkarev, etc. At the same time, it is concluded that, despite the historical charm of Prague recognized by the majority of Russians, a considerable number of émigrés perceived it as a provincial city, inferior to Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is shown that in the émigré intellectual culture there was a contradictory perception of Prague. At the same time, they wrote about it both about the center of the Slavic world, with deep historical roots, and about the cultural province of Europe. Therefore, the image of Prague was complex and contradictory. There is no doubt that the historical images of the Czech capital left a noticeable mark on the intellectual culture of the Russian emigration. © 2023 Ltd ""Integration: Education and Science"".

"Machine translation (MT) plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP) to automate the translation of different natural languages. Machine translation (MT) comes into existence as computational linguistic subfield of NLP and AI to automate various tasks and generate intelligence in machine like humans. The demand of MT systems growing day by day to make the task easier. By using various approaches of MT one can implement natural language processing concept in various fields like spam filtering, robotics, sentiment analysis automated learning, real-time translation applications like text-to-text or text-to-speech and vice versa, etc. There are various approaches like rule based MT, statistical MT, hybrid or neural MT approaches that are used to achieve MT process like Google Translator currently uses NMT approach to translate many language pairs. But still machine translation is facing numerous challenges to achieve high accuracy states. In this paper, we have discussed some approaches and the current challenges in MT to achieve natural language processing.

"This paper investigates the discursive formation of non-multimodal and multimodal text for promoting skin whitening products from 2006 to 2020. Text types include advertorial articles, product naming, graphic adverts, and commercial films. It is found that the fighting metaphor treating melanin or blackness as a target to expel, suppress, or eliminate is predominant in both written and visual texts. Throughout the analysis, the results suggest that the skin-whitening discourses intersect and promote the unequal power relations of the macro-structures of gender, class, and race. Following the findings, concerns about the application of fighting metaphor and rhetoric of skin whitening products in globalized society are discussed. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"In 2016, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that human error is involved in 94–96% of all motor vehicle crashes. Also in 2016, Bonnefon et al. predicted that autonomous vehicles could eliminate 90% of traffic collisions due to their elimination of human error. However, questions of safety, accessibility, and social equity have arisen after the first pedestrian death by an autonomous vehicle in its testing phase occurred in Tempe, AZ, in 2018. This project analyzes how social equity issues shape the discussion, creation, and implementation of governmental policies and regulations surrounding driverless automobiles in Tempe, using policy and text analysis as well as semi-structured interviews of government officials or residents of Tempe. Informed by the concept of the right to the city and critical legal studies, this research suggests that public policy around autonomous vehicles does create new and expand existing spaces for inequality in Tempe. This is exacerbated by increased awareness of inequality within Arizona’s autonomous vehicle regulation scheme and its entire transportation system after the first pedestrian death by autonomous vehicle. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

"Using formative design experiment, we engaged in iterative rounds of data collection, analysis, and redesign across three rounds to explore and hone 41 preservice-teachers’ (PTs’) preparation for selecting and integrating digital texts/tools in literacy instruction. Each PT submitted about two videos of literacy tutoring sessions (88 total). These were scored for quality using the DigiLit Framework rubric criteria. Multilevel regression modeling was used to explore potential changes in the quality across three rounds. Findings showed that shifts in literacy professor’s pedagogy (sharing model videos of digital texts/tools integration) resulted in improved PT’s practices (modeling literacy practices, modeling and guiding digital tool use, transformativeness). Further, findings underscore the importance of design experiments to uncover more effective teacher educator practices. © 2023 ISTE."
"In the intelligent document analysis and application of military news texts, due to the polysemous and synonymous of military weapons and equipment entities, the computer cannot distinguish the ambiguity, so the weapon and equipment entities cannot be directly associated with the knowledge graph. To address this issue, entity linking is employed with Candidate Generation being a crucial step. To effectively enhance the efficiency of entity linking, this paper proposes a military equipment Candidate Generation method based on multi-feature fusion. Given the few text datasets and a large amount of labeling in the military domain, this paper adopts the method of transfer learning to train the model on the general domain dataset and then transfer it to the military domain dataset. The Candidate Generation task of entity linking is completed by integrating the character, pinyin, and English features of weapon equipment entities. The experimental results show that the Candidate Generation task Recall of the military equipment entity linking system reaches 95.85%. © 2023 IEEE."

"Machine learning-based personality prediction methods have become the mainstream prediction method. But existing Big Five personality prediction methods based on user-generated text rely too much on pre-trained language models to ignore the sentiment information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Big Five personality prediction method based on pre-trained language models and SenticNet6, which is a new sentiment knowledge base. The correlation analysis and ablation experiment shows that SenticNet6 can be used for Big Five personality prediction tasks. The experiment results indicate that our proposed method improves the state-of-art results for each Big Five personality trait by 9.89%, 9.39%, 2.99%, 3.01%, and 4.28% on Essays dataset, respectively. © 2023 SPIE."
"In this paper we analyze the animated filmic hypertext made by Alexandr Petrov, derived from the novel by Ernest Hemingway, based on some proposals made by Gérard Genette on transtextuality, to highlight the main phenomena of transformation that are verified in the film, regarding the literary work, as well as its semantic consequences. Among these trans-formations are the reduction of the literary text, but also the reor-ganization of certain elements, the exclusion of some sociocultural anchor points that were indicated in the written work. These phenomena have important semantic consequences and guide the interpretation of the plot in a different sense from that of the original text. © 2023, Universidad de Malaga.

"With the rapid development of technology in the era of artificial intelligence, the speed and efficiency of machine translation have been greatly improved. However, machine translation cannot completely replace human translation in the specific translation field and under the restrictions of current technical conditions, which makes post editing crucial. Based on the three-dimensional transformations of Eco-Translatology, this Paper analyzes specific problems in Chinese-English machine translation and explains how the theory guides the post-editing. In this theory, translation is summarized as the three-dimensional transformations including the adaptive and selective transformation focused on the linguistic, cultural and communicative dimensions. The analyses of sentence components and discourses, cultural contexts and their embodiment in the machine translation, and the communicative intentions and their transmission are conducted under the guidance of this theory, giving deeper insights to the machine translation post-editing strategies of Jiangxi tourism texts and providing possible directions for the future translation research of Jiangxi tourism texts from the perspective of the three-dimensional transformations. © 2023 IEEE."
"Robots are projected to affect healthcare services in significant, but unpredictable, ways. Many believe robots will add value to future healthcare, but their arrival has triggered controversy. Debates revolve around how robotics will impact healthcare provision, their effects on the future of labor and caregiver–patient relationships, and ethical dilemmas associated with autonomous machines. This study investigates media representations of healthcare robotics in Norway over a twenty-year period, using a mixed-methods design. Media representations affect public opinion in multiple ways. By assembling and presenting information through stories, they not only set the agenda by broadcasting values, experiences, and expectations about new technologies, but also frame and prime specific understandings of issues. First, we employ an inductive text-mining approach known as “topic modeling,” a computational method for eliciting abstract semantic structures from large text corpora. Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, we implement a topic model of manifest content from 752 articles, published in Norwegian print media between 1.1.2000 and 2.10.2020, sampled from a comprehensive database for news media (Atekst, Retriever). We complement this computational lens with a more fine-grained, qualitative analysis of content in exemplary texts sampled from each topic. Here, we identify prominent “frames,” discursive cues for interpreting how various stakeholders talk about healthcare robotics as a contested domain of policy and practice in a comprehensive welfare state. We also highlight some benefits of this approach for analyzing media discourse and stakeholder perspectives on controversial technologies. © The Author(s) 2023."

"The article attempts to analyze the general trajectory of Western media coverage of the religious environment in Ukraine. Recently, the religious situation in Ukraine has become one of the strategic issues of national security, since it is relevant and important in the light of not only the religious, but also the political context of Ukraine. The study examines the journalistic activity of Western publications about the religious transformations of Ukraine from 2019 to 2023. This encompasses the intensity of the rapid confessional changes in Ukraine, the style of the journalistic text under study, the intensity of their media representation, and the peculiarities of Western publishing. As sources of information, data on open Internet resources, as well as publications in the Western press and blogs are used. The key representations of the Ukrainian religious situation in the American and European mass media are analyzed, and a media context is found in which a specific interpretation of religious issues is proposed, taking into account intense transformational components. The influence of the work of several popular Western media, in particular, the Pulitzer Center, ContactUkraine, ukrainetrek.com, U.S. Department of State, United States Institute of Peace, and others, regarding the Ukrainian religious and political environment is considered. Special attention is drawn to the state reaction to the aggressive influences of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), in particular, and is referred to by the modern press under the stamp ""Moscow Patriarchate"" (MP) and is recognized as the pro-Russian and at the same time the largest religious community represented on Ukrainian lands. A political and socio-religious analysis of the processes that took place in Ukraine during the specified period is compiled. The relevance of the research topic is due not only to the widespread public interest and involvement in the waves of confessional shifts, but also to the revealed political instability of church life. This was presented by Western media for the European and American target audiences and was not associated with the UOC-MP and today's religious trends. Therefore, we consider it peculiar that the reflection by journalists of Western publications forced the Ukrainian state apparatus to have influences on a hostile religious institution. Accordingly, consideration of the content of foreign publications is important for the further development of the image of the modern world religious discourse. © 2023, George Fox University Murdock Learning Resource Center.

"Social networks have become the main stage for discussion on various current topics. In particular, electoral processes tend to bring many publications with polarized opinions on political issues addressed by candidates. A comprehensive analysis of social media publications on high-impact controversial topics and the opinions expressed in them could contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamics of political discussion, providing valuable insights for society. In this context, we investigate how to apply a clustering-based topic modeling approach to produce public evaluation information on different current issues, in particular controversial political topics. We propose a framework that enriches text representations, combining state-of-the-art unsupervised (HDBSCAN) and supervised (BERTimbau) techniques to identify controversial political topics in social media publications in Brazilian Portuguese. To this end, weekly collections were carried out on the social network Twitter, making it possible to identify controversial events for each analyzed date. We compare the controversial topics uncovered with real-world news to validate the results and compare our method with a traditional method described in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Anti-Black language ideologies manifest in exclusionary language policies (e.g. Sung & Allen-Handy 2019), educational tracking (e.g. Sung 2018), and scholarly claims of Black 'deficiency' (Smitherman 2000). A liberal educational research tradition has countered with ethnographic accounts of cultural 'mismatch' (Michaels 2006) vis-à-vis Black educational 'failure'. Conducting a textual analysis of an archive of ethnography of communication texts, I locate multiple genealogical linkages holding between 'mismatch' and deprivation discourses, principally ones centered on representations of 'pathological' Black 'matriarchy'. Paralleling Black feminist theorizations of 'fungible Black flesh' (e.g. Hartman 1997), I account for these representations by conceptualizing 'fungible Black sound'. I further argue that 'fungible fugitivity' (e.g. Snorton 2017), that is, how Blackness fluidly responds to white incursion is linguistically realized in acts of 'signifyin(g)' (e.g. Mitchell-Kernan 1999), yielding the analytic category 'fungible(ly) fugitive Black sound'. Lastly, I reread an ethnographic text with this analytic to illustrate its affordance for (re)imagining Black futurity.

"Purpose: With the deep development of the new technological revolution and industrial transformation, the development, application, expansion and integration of digital technology provide opportunities for transforming the manufacturing industry from traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing. However, little research currently focuses on analyzing the influencing factors of intelligent development in this field. There is a lack of research from the perspective of the digital innovation ecosystem to explore the intrinsic mechanism that drives intelligent development. Therefore, this article starts with high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises as the research subject to explore how their digital innovation ecosystem promotes the effectiveness of enterprise intelligent development, providing theoretical support and policy guidance for enterprises to achieve intelligent development at the current stage. Design/methodology/approach: This article constructs a logical framework for the digital innovation ecosystem using a “three-layer core-periphery” structure, collects data using crawling for subsequent indicator measurement and assessment and uses the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fsQCA) to explore how the various components of the digital innovation ecosystem in high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises work together to promote the development of enterprise intelligently. Findings: This article finds that the various components of the digital innovation ecosystem of high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises, through mutual coordination, can help improve the level of enterprise intelligence. Empirical analysis shows four specific configuration implementation paths for the digital innovation ecosystem of high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises to promote intelligent development. The core conditions and their combinations that affect the intelligent development of enterprises differ in each configuration path. Originality/value: Firstly, this article discusses the practical problems of intelligent transformation and development in the manufacturing industry and focuses on the intelligent development effectiveness of various components of the digital innovation ecosystem of high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises in the context of digitalization. Secondly, this article uses crawling, text sentiment analysis and other methods to creatively collect relevant data to overcome the research dilemma of being limited to theoretical analysis due to the difficulty in obtaining data in this field. At the same time, based on the characteristics of high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises, the “three-layer core-periphery” digital innovation ecosystem framework constructed in this article helps to gain a deep understanding of the development characteristics of the industry's enterprises, provides specific indicator analysis for their intelligent development, opening the “black box” of intelligent development in the industry's enterprises and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Finally, this study uses the fsQCA research method of configuration analysis to explore the complexity of the antecedents and investigate the combined effects of multiple factors on intelligent development, providing new perspectives and rich research results for relevant literature on the intelligent development of high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In the detection and maintenance of winder, a large number of text maintenance records containing rich fault characteristics will be saved, but at present, the fault diagnosis of textile winder still mainly relies on manual investigation, failing to realize intelligent diagnosis, and the text maintenance records can not be fully utilized. Therefore, aiming at the problem of textile winder fault text classification, a fault classification method for textile winder named ERNIE-TEXTCNN-LightGBM (ETL) is proposed based on short text and sparse feature data. Through mask language model training of ERNIE model, The contextual semantic data and entity knowledge data are obtained respectively, and the semantic characteristics of the fault article are fully grasped. Then TEXTCNN model is used to extract local features from convolution layer and pooling layer, and learn the semantic association between adjacent words to overcome the loss of local features. Finally, the LightGBM model is integrated to reduce the parameters of the model, to realize the fault classification of the maintenance text, to assist the fault maintenance of the winder, and to improve the production efficiency of the factory. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, ETL is compared with other common text classification models, and the experiments show that the proposed method is effective and superior in realizing the maintenance text fault diagnosis of winder. © 2023 IEEE."
"‘Arts-in-education’ and teacher-artist partnership have been a key focus of recent policy in Irish arts education. However, recent research studies have highlighted how at times these partnerships can be problematic and teachers can become sidelined when such interventions occur. This article offers a new perspective on such research by exploring how the language of policy texts and the broader neoliberal discourse in which they are framed may impact the positioning of teachers and thus their possibilities for practice within partnerships. Using a critical policy lens, this article deconstructs the policy texts that have embedded ‘arts-in-education’ practice in Ireland and highlights some of the hidden narratives which have positioned the teacher as ‘other’ within Irish arts education policy. In doing so, it aims to illuminate the process of ‘othering’ within policy for researchers, policy-makers and teachers, and outline the potential implications of such positioning for the provision of arts education in primary schools. © 2023 Educational Studies Association of Ireland."

"Unsolicited bulk telephone calls — termed ""robocalls"" — nearly outnumber legitimate calls, overwhelming telephone users. While the vast majority of these calls are illegal, they are also ephemeral. Although telephone service providers, regulators, and researchers have ready access to call metadata, they do not have tools to investigate call content at the vast scale required. This paper presents SnorCall, a framework that scalably and efficiently extracts content from robocalls. SnorCall leverages the Snorkel framework that allows a domain expert to write simple labeling functions to classify text with high accuracy. We apply SnorCall to a corpus of transcripts covering 232,723 robocalls collected over a 23-month period. Among many other findings, SnorCall enables us to obtain first estimates on how prevalent different scam and legitimate robocall topics are, determine which organizations are referenced in these calls, estimate the average amounts solicited in scam calls, identify shared infrastructure between campaigns, and monitor the rise and fall of election-related political calls. As a result, we demonstrate how regulators, carriers, anti-robocall product vendors, and researchers can use SnorCall to obtain powerful and accurate analyses of robocall content and trends that can lead to better defenses. © USENIX Security 2023.

"The coupling framework of modern literary works and traditional culture is first discussed in this paper, and the intrinsic connection between them is examined. Secondly, a semantic-associated information extraction network model is constructed using LSTM and attention mechanism, and the target semantic fusion is achieved through semantic space conversion and semantic-associated information extraction. Finally, the dataset and empirical analysis confirm the SAIEDMMA model's effectiveness. The results show that the F1 value of the SAIE-DMMA model on the Total-Text dataset and ICDAR2015 dataset is 85.59% and 87.72%, respectively. The traditional culture of folk culture has the highest degree of integration in modern literature, and the growth of its literature from 2017 to 2021 is 1,273 books. This shows that the semantic correlation information extraction network can analyze the semantics of the integration of modern literary works and traditional culture, and it can also be used to promote the effective inheritance and development of traditional culture so that modern literary works are closer to public life.  © 2023 Hong Su, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Enhancing Sustainable User Experience through Multimedia Integration: A Study on Interactive Design and User Engagement in Web Pages. As multimedia becomes increasingly popular on the Internet, the incorporation of animation, video, and audio alongside traditional text and image media presents new opportunities to promote sustainability. This paper delves into the sustainable integration of multimedia technologies in web pages, aiming to introduce their design and evaluate their impact on user experience, particularly in terms of interactivity. Business professionals seeking sustainable practices are increasingly interested in content that not only engages but also aligns with their environmentally conscious target audience. Hence, this study explores the motivation mechanics of sustainable consumer behaviour while assessing the perceived sustainability of emerging multimedia services. By understanding sustainable consumer participation in multimedia content, the research aims to inspire and improve sustainable interactive design for web pages. Through extensive analysis, the paper reveals valuable insights into the influence of sustainable multimedia design on user engagement and satisfaction. The findings highlight that integrating sustainable multimedia elements into web pages can significantly enhance the overall user experience and improve the effectiveness of online communication. This study advocates for the strategic incorporation of sustainable multimedia in web design to create easily understandable and visually appealing content that resonates with sustainability-conscious users. © 2023 SPIE."
"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the physical health of the Central American population. Fear, anxiety and stress were normal reactions in quarantine, due to the uncertainty of the unknown, which makes it understandable that the population experienced feelings or psychological affections. Social networks were the means of communication for thousands of people in quarantine. The increased use of social networks to share comments, content and opinions makes it possible to have a large amount of information. Twitter has been one of the most widely used social networks due to its ease of access and use. The analysis of tweets requires a systematic process for their collection, transformation and classification, integrating different artificial intelligence tools such as natural language processing, automatic learning or deep learning. Automatic text classification aims at finding an adequate way to categorize the documents according to the attributes made up of words that describe each specific category. For this reason, our study has been carried out with a corpus in Spanish extracted from Twitter for the automatic classification of texts, from which we have categorized, through the automatic learning approach, the tweets about Covid-19 in the Central American region, in order to know if the population has suffered any psychological effects. Based on the results, we can say that the automatic learning models provide competitive results in terms of automatic identification of texts with an accuracy of 89%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This paper proposes an estimating method for the general trend of the number of danmakus in League of Legends eSports, where the danmaku refer to real-time text comments sent by the audiences. Firstly, we collected 72 top-viewed League of Legends eSports videos and all their danmakus, calculated the average trend of in-game score superiority and the number of danmakus over time for all videos, and assumed that the changes in the number of danmakus were caused by the change in score superiority. Then, we innovatively extracted two major factors that affect audiences' psychology from the fitted average superiority funtion: competitive and suspense, and establish a binary linear model for estimating the number of danmakus. Finally, we verified the proposed model, and the results showed that it can correctly estimate the general trend of the danmaku in two kinds of typical games. This model could help game researchers or designers understand how the eSports games make audiences and players feel fun and then improve the game mechanics. © 2023 IEEE."
"Past research has noted that alternative media often facilitate debate between activists and advocates for political policies. However, such research does not typically address the processes for those debates. In recent years, political influencers have increasingly made debates important content in the alternative media they produce through streaming services. In 2021, I observed a debate between three influencers that took place through YouTube and Twitch. In this research project, I engaged in a qualitative content analysis of key texts, using concepts concerning debate from past political communication research. Specifically, I examined the pre-debate, debate and post-debate stages in order to identify different attacks, acclaims or defences utilised by the influencers. The findings, viewed through the lens of mediated construction of reality described by Couldry and Hepp, demonstrate that those linear stages established in past campaign research do not fully apply to the context of alternative media found on streaming services. Instead, this debate was a nonlinear process in which the “pre-debate” stage was actually the debate. © 2023 EURICOM."

"Analyzing online retrospective experience reports of psychedelic use can provide valuable insight into their acute subjective effects. Such reports are unexplored in relation to mystical states, which are thought to be a therapeutic mechanism within psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. We created a set of words that, when encountered in an experience report, indicate the occurrence of mystical elements within the experience. We used the Shroomery.org website to retrieve 7317 publicly available retrospective psychedelic experience reports of psychedelic use, primarily of psilocybin, and have a designated experience intensity level self-assessed by the text authors during submission of the report. We counted the mystical language words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software and additionally performed sentiment analysis of all reports. We found that the occurrence of mystical language grew with increased self-reported experience intensity. We also found that negative sentiment increased, and positive sentiment decreased as self-reported psychedelic experience intensity increased. These two findings raise the question of whether mystical experiences can co-exist with challenging elements within the psychedelic experience, a consideration for future qualitative studies. We present a new mystical language dictionary measure for further use and expansion, with some suggestions on how it can be used in future studies. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"The article discusses the development of a literary narrative about Ekaterinburg — Sverdlovsk, associated with utopian projects for the organization of urban life. The subject of utopia was most often the administrative bodies, and framed each of the ideas, recorded the signs of its implementation and the emotional reaction of the urban community. All new generations of writers, including in their texts the images of Ekaterinburg — Sverdlovsk developed by their predecessors, were carried away by the idea of the city’s “mission”, described its everyday life and growing dissatisfaction with it. An analysis of changes in the city image leads to the conclusion that Ekaterinburg went through three “turns” of descriptions along similar vectors. In the 18th — early 20th the Ekaterinburg founders’ dreams about “a model in the model world of state-owned mining plants” were replaced first by the image of the city as a “living knot”, and then by its image as an ordinary provincial city. Since the mid-1920s, the image of the “city of Sverdlov” has been formed in literature — a “model Soviet city” that rejected the past. Sverdlovsk is perceived as an “arsenal city”, but by the end of the 1940s, the image of the regional center beloved by the inhabitants was localized. In the 1990s, the fate of the “third capital” was predicted for Ekaterinburg, but in parallel, the motives of increasing provincialization and the predestination of the fate of the place were developing in the literature. © 2023 Institute of History and Archeology of the Ural Branch of RAS.

"Advances in textual classification can foster quality in existing clinical systems. Our research explored experimentally text classification methods applied in non-synthetic oncology clinical notes corpora. The experiments were performed in a dataset with 3,308 medical notes. Experiments evaluated the following machine learning and deep learning classification methods: Multilayer Perceptron Neural network, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, K-nearest neighbors classifier, and Long-Short Term Memory. An experiment evaluated the influence of the corpora preprocessing step on the results, allowing us to identify that the classifier’s mean accuracy was leveraged from 26.1% to 86.7% with the per-clinical-event corpus and 93.9% with the per-patient corpus. The best-performing classifier was the Multilayer Perceptron, which achieved 93.90% accuracy, a Macro F1 score of 93.61%, and a Weighted F1 score of 93.99%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This paper proposes a Contrastive Learning-Based Multi-Modal Entity Alignment and Feature Fusion Method (CMEAF) for addressing the challenge of poor entity alignment in Chinese electric power knowledge graph retrieval tasks. Firstly, we combine the ideas of multi-modal contrastive learning from CLIP and momentum contrastive learning from MoCo to design an improved contrastive loss function (MCCL). By introducing a more flexible negative sample selection strategy and incorporating momentum updates, the performance of contrastive learning is enhanced. Secondly, in the multi-modal feature fusion stage, we propose a Cross-Modal Attention Fusion (CMAF) method that leverages cross-modal attention mechanisms to fully exploit the interactive information between image and text features, achieving superior multi-modal feature fusion. Lastly, in the model pre-processing stage, we adopt the Mixup data augmentation idea and propose a Joint Data Augmentation approach based on image-text pairs (TMIXUP) to enhance downstream retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements of our proposed method in multi-modal entity alignment and feature fusion tasks. Compared to the baseline model WUKONG, CMEAF achieves a 2.5% increase in average recall rate on the MUGE dataset and a 4.1% improvement in MR performance on the Flickr30k-CN dataset. On the self-built POWER dataset, CMEAF also achieves excellent retrieval performance with an MR score of 93.7%. Furthermore, this paper conducts visual analysis to further showcase the advantages of multi-modal fusion. The proposed method effectively aligns Chinese cross-modal entities with high accuracy and practicality. © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Conversational agents (CAs), or chatbots, are computer programs that simulate conversations with humans. The use of CAs in health care settings is recent and rapidly increasing, which often translates to poor reporting of the CA development and evaluation processes and unreliable research findings. We developed and published a conceptual framework, designing, developing, evaluating, and implementing a smartphone-delivered, rule-based conversational agent (DISCOVER), consisting of 3 iterative stages of CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 2 cross-cutting themes (user-centered design and data privacy and security). Objective: This study aims to perform in-depth, semistructured interviews with multidisciplinary experts in health care CAs to share their views on the definition and classification of health care CAs and evaluate and validate the DISCOVER conceptual framework. Methods: We conducted one-on-one semistructured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) with 12 multidisciplinary CA experts using an interview guide based on our framework. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed by the research team, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Following participants’ input, we defined CAs as digital interfaces that use natural language to engage in a synchronous dialogue using ≥1 communication modality, such as text, voice, images, or video. CAs were classified by 13 categories: response generation method, input and output modalities, CA purpose, deployment platform, CA development modality, appearance, length of interaction, type of CA-user interaction, dialogue initiation, communication style, CA personality, human support, and type of health care intervention. Experts considered that the conceptual framework could be adapted for artificial intelligence–based CAs. However, despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, including large language models, the technology is not able to ensure safety and reliability in health care settings. Finally, aligned with participants’ feedback, we present an updated iteration of the conceptual framework for health care conversational agents (CHAT) with key considerations for CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 3 cross-cutting themes: ethics, user involvement, and data privacy and security. Conclusions: We present an expanded, validated CHAT and aim at guiding researchers from a variety of backgrounds and with different levels of expertise in the design, development, and evaluation and implementation of rule-based CAs in health care settings. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Fake news is now widely disseminated through social media networking platforms. These stories have factual inaccuracies and crumbed material, and as a result of these inaccuracies, unfavorable events have arisen in society. Various verification methods and algorithms have been used on social media platforms to manage such content. In a prior study, the linguistic structures of text were employed to detect false or authentic contents, and machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to discern temporal patterns. The complex models of neural network architecture have been employed in recent research to aid in the selection of the right parameters from the dataset as well as the calculation of superior outcomes. In order to identify whether certain articles or statements are true or fake, this study employed two separate datasets: one to train the model and the other to generate real-time authenticity scores. The deep neural networks’ LSTM and Bi-LSTM techniques were used to train the suggested model. This research was successfully tested using real-time subreddit blogs, generating authenticity measures with their probability scores and verifying the blogs’ trustworthy sources. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"The article analyzes for the first time the identification and content of Russian military symbols and their use in Russian Orthodoxy. At the linguistic level, it was found that such word formation Z-Orthodoxy was taken from the publications and public speeches of Archimandrite Kyrylo Govorun. Our study focuses on the proposal to use the neologism Z-Orthodoxy to demonstrate some semantic interpretations in the context of the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and the entire democratic world. As a result of the analysis of the military symbols of the Russian Federation, Russian Orthodoxy found that after February 24, 2022, people can be symbolically divided into two parts. Similar to the biblical texts from the book of Revelation, the letter Z has become an identifier for humanity or complete inhumanity. The symbolism of the Russian army resembles the Nazi swastika in appearance and content, although the Germans and Russians put a different meaning into their symbols. For victims of these regimes, the lines in the Z symbol have opposite meanings. Namely, good and evil, truth and lies, honesty and hypocrisy, justice and injustice, restoration and destruction, etc. All these features are separated by a zigzag Z in the history of the modern Christian church. © 2023, George Fox University Murdock Learning Resource Center.

"Text-To-SQL is crucial for enabling users without technical expertise to effectively extract important information from databases. The graph-based encoder has been successfully employed in this field. However, existing methods often adopt a node-centric approach, focusing on single-hop edge relations. This approach gives rise to two main issues: 1) failure to differentiate between single-hop and multi-hop relations among nodes; 2) ignoring the valuable multi-hop reasoning information between nodes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph Attention Diffusion Enhanced Text-To-SQL(GADESQL) model that enables multi-hop reasoning among nodes. With GAD, information can propagate efficiently through multi-hop paths, uniquely integrating single-hop and multi-hop relations during the graph iteration process. Furthermore, we employ Semantic Dependency Parsing for natural language analysis, constructing a semantic analysis tree for questions to enhance the effective connection between question tokens and Schema structures. Experiments on the cross-domain dataset Spider demonstrate that our model possesses strong generalization capabilities, achieving certain performance improvements over existing works. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"This article explores the issue of ‘re-enchantment’ through an ethnographic analysis of ‘spiritual literature’ in post-Yugoslav Serbia. Following the anthropologist Alfred Gell, it argues that Orthodox texts can be understood as ‘enchanted technology’ which, in turn, allows them to work as a ‘technology of enchantment’. Spiritual literature–distributed as physical objects between bags, bookshelves, bookshops, and kiosks, as well as digitally via social media–can propel some people to grow as Orthodox Christians and relate to society in Orthodox terms. After situating the re-emergence of Orthodox publishing in historical perspective, the article shows how people defer to books and how texts circulate. Overall, the article reveals the mechanics of one form of re-enchantment. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Despite its prominence in societal and scholarly discourse, a consistent definition and scope for media diversity remains elusive. This leaves ambiguous its characteristics, concerns, and impacts and complicates efforts to achieve its benefits. This study sought a new approach to identifying its role that leverages lived experiences of the public interacting with their media ecosystem. Public submissions to the Media diversity in Australia inquiry presented a unique opportunity to pursue this goal. The 5068 texts were dominated by citizens perspectives that went beyond reframing and redefining media diversity to explain how they saw it affecting their daily lives, families, and communities. Using multi-stage thematic analysis, this study worked to consolidate these diverse and grounded views into the shared themes that confronted citizens, finding concerns about the diminishing reliability of media functions, with losses in media diversity leading to unsatisfactory media performance, media avoidance, and harms for communities and individuals. © The Author(s) 2023."
"In the 19th — early 20th centuries Russian Empire the main advertising load fell precisely on periodicals, which determines the importance of advertisements in the periodicals as a source on the history of regional entrepreneurship and trade. Researchers have repeatedly emphasized the significant role of a provincial gazette as an advertising medium. The article considers advertisements published by merchants in the Vologda Provincial Gazette from the first issue in 1838 to 1860. The dynamics of the number of advertisements demonstrates, first, a gradual increase in the importance of the Gazette as a regional mass media and the understanding of this trend by merchants; second, a general intensification of the role of advertising in the field of entrepreneurship. The geography of advertisements correctly reflects the system of trade relations in the province. The subject matter of the ads was quite diverse (haberdashery, printed materials, raw materials, foodstuffs, household goods) and covered mainly elite groups of goods, although agricultural raw materials accounted for a significant share of the advertising objects. An analysis of the ads genre specificity indicates the predominance of narrative ones; the incentive function largely begins to manifest itself in the texts of the 1850s. Graphic design of advertisements in the period under review can be already encountered, but it is not widespread. © 2023 Institute of History and Archeology of the Ural Branch of RAS.

"The article is devoted to establishing the new sources of the text of the Life of St. Pancratius of Tauromenia. As a result of the analysis, several sources of its text were identified such as the novel “Leucippe and Clitophon” by Achilles Tatius (2nd century C. E.), autobiographical poems of St. Gregory of Nazianzus (late 4th century), the “Augustan History” (Historia Augusta, late 4th — early 5th century) and, separately, the writings of ancient historians for the legend of Taurus and Menia. In addition, parallels were found with the Syriac version of the “Acts of St. John” (5th century), which, perhaps, in some cases is closer to the Life than the Greek version of Pseudo-Prochorus. A special attention in the article is paid to the literary techniques and methods that are used by the author during his work with the sources of the Life. The sources considered in this article reveal the same methods described earlier in historiography, which the author of the Life uses when working with texts from other sources. The study carried out led to the conclusion that the author of the Life of St. Pancratius was an outstanding representative of the “dark ages” period of Byzantine literature (middle of the 7th — middle of the 9th centuries) and wrote for a “classically” educated audience or customer. © 2023 Ltd ""Integration: Education and Science"".

"This study, under the guidance of Skopos theory, the translation strategies of cultural loaded words in the two translations are compared and analyzed to explore the impact on the target language readers, and in an attempt to summarize what measures should be adopted to minimize or avoid the translation errors of culture-loaded words. This study adopts the quantitative analysis method to compare and analyze the English translations of the Tao Te Ching by Waley and Zhao Yanchun, taking the three principles of Skopos theory as the guide, and selecting the cultural loaded words in the original language culture and the corresponding translations in the target language text as the objects of study. Through the analysis, the paper finds that from the perspective of Skopos theory, the two translators, although translating the same text, have different personal backgrounds, and their translation strategies are very different. Therefore, when translating Chinese cultural classics, translators should be clear about the goal of spreading Chinese culture and choose strategies, techniques, and methods that the reader will accept, which will tell a good Chinese story and spread Chinese culture better. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd.

"[Purpose/Significance] This study aims to explore the justice values, discourse strategies and social impact of open government data policies, which provides reference for regulating the flow and utilization of open data and promoting the realization of its public value. [Design/Methodology] Based on organizational justice theory and critical discourse analysis framework, the national open government data policies documents with significance in different periods of China and the United States were selected and analyzed in terms of keywords, word clusters and justice dimensions in the text level. Then, the discourse strategies and evolution of justice values of the two countries' policies were analyzed from the perspective of discourse practice. Finally, combined with the perspective of social practice, this study discussed the impact of policy discourse on the fair order of open data practices. [Findings/Conclusion] The discourse construction of social justice in the open government data policies of China and the United States has undergone a gradual development from the jurisprudential equality of rights and economic value orientation to the universal fairness in the sociological sense, intertwined with different focus on procedural justice, information justice and distributive justice. The discourse strategies of intertextuality and coherence are employed in these policies to embed the justice values, which in turn contribute to the trend of equalization, value maximization and conflict in the open government data practice. [Originality/Value] Theoretically, this study explores the justice values and discourse construction strategies of open government data policies in China and the United States, and explains the impact of policy discourse on open data practice. Practically, the results of this study clarify the direction of government data governance and provide insights for the improvement of open data policies. © 2023 Editorial Office of Documentation, Information and Knowledge.

"Sentiment analysis (SA) model calculates the opinion of the text after representing text as a learned feature vector. Vector representation generated from the model is crucial for sentiment analysis. Modern transformer models, including generative pre-training (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), dynamically learn text representation. However, the sentiment orientation from a global perspective is ignored. On the other hand, several models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is also utilized to learn text representation. With pre-trained sentiment-aware static word embedding as an input, model captures the global representation of text. But the local dynamic representations are disregarded. So in this paper, the suggested model combines the local dynamic representation with the sentiment oriented global text representation to produce accurate text representation. It acquires global representation by refined pre-trained word embedding with a CNN and dynamic local representations by utilizing a pre-trained BERT transformer. The combined global and local representation from CNN and pre-trained BERT presents the text more precisely from sentiment point of view. The result signifies that the proposed model identified sentiment with greater accuracy than the pre-trained transformer. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"With the situation of cyber security becoming more and more complex, the mining and analysis of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) have become a prominent focus in the field of cyber security. Social media platforms like Twitter, due to their powerful timeliness and extensive coverage, have become valuable data sources for cyber security. However, these data often comprise a substantial amount of invalid and interfering data, posing challenges for existing deep learning models in identifying critical CTI. To address this issue, we propose a novel CTI automatic extraction model, called ATDG, designed for detecting cyber security text and extracting cyber threat entities. Specifically, our model utilizes a Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DPCNN) and BIGRU to extract character-level and word-level features from the text, to better extract of semantic information at different levels, which effectively improved out of vocabulary (OOV) problem in threat intelligence. Additionally, we introduce a self-attention mechanism at the encoding layer to enable the model to focus on key features and enhance its performance, which dynamically adjusts the attention given to different features. Furthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced sample distribution, we have incorporated Focal Loss into ATDG, enhancing our model capability to effectively handle data imbalances. Experimental results demonstrate that ATDG (92.49% F1-score and 93.07% F1-score) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both tasks, and effectiveness of introducing self-attention mechanism and Focal Loss is also demonstrated. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"With the thriving of social networks, sentiment analysis at aspect-level has become a research hotspot in the field of natural language processing, aiming to extract user expressed sentiment from massive text data. To tackle the problem that current sentiment analysis methods cannot simultaneously consider the contextual and syntactic information of aspect terms, this paper proposes a targeted model for aspect-level sentiment analysis by embedding different neighborhood representations. By integrating aspect neighborhood information and node neighborhood information through convolutional neural networks, our proposed model achieves high effectiveness on 5 public datasets as demonstrated by the evaluation coefficients constructed in our study. © 2023 SPIE."
"Static rewriting enables late-state code changes (e.g., to add mitigations, to remove unnecessary code, or to instrument for code coverage) at low overhead in security-critical environments. Most research on static rewriting has so far focused on the x86 architecture. However, the prevalence and proliferation of ARM-based devices along with a large amount of personal data (e.g., health and sensor data) that they process calls for efficient introspection and analysis capabilities on the ARM platform. Addressing the unique challenges on aarch64, we introduce ARMore, the first efficient, robust, and heuristicfree static binary rewriter for arbitrary aarch64 binaries that produces reassembleable assembly. The key improvements introduced by ARMore make the recovery of indirect control flow an option rather than a necessity. Instead of crashing, the cost of an uncovered target only causes the small overhead of an additional branch. ARMore can rewrite binaries from different languages and compilers (even arbitrary hand-written assembly), both on PIC and non-PIC code, with or without symbols, including exception handling for C++ and Go binaries, and also including binaries with mixed data and text. ARMore is sound as it does not rely on any assumptions about the input binary. ARMore is also efficient: it does not employ any expensive dynamic translation techniques, incurring negligible overhead (<1% in our evaluated benchmarks). Our AFL++ coverage instrumentation pass enables fuzzing of closed-source aarch64 binaries at three times the speed compared to the stateof-the-art (AFL-QEMU), and we found 58 unique crashes in closed-source software. ARMore is the only static rewriter whose rewritten binaries correctly pass all SQLite3 and coreutils test cases and autopkgtest of 97.5% Debian packages. © 2023 32nd USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2023.

"Purpose: This study introduces a policy with great strategic significance and far-reaching impact by analyzing the background, measures, and future development trends of teacher evaluation reform in China. Design/Approach/Methods: This study primarily conducts a policy text analysis of the section on teacher evaluation of the Overall Plan for Deepening the Reform of Educational Evaluation in the New Era. Findings: The Overall Plan for Deepening the Reform of Educational Evaluation in the New Era was drafted to enhance the quality of Chinese teachers and address many problems in teacher evaluation. It comprised four sections: teachers’ professional ethics, teaching effectiveness, evaluation models and methods, and honorary titles. The policy has distinctive features such as the high status and authority of the issuing body, a holistic and systematic nature, and an orientation toward practical issues. This article proposes three major policy foresights: promoting implementation through the force of political trends, giving schools autonomy in teacher evaluations, and implementing progressive reforms. Originality/Value: This study conducted a specialist analysis of the policy in combination with the real scenario and institutional environment of Chinese teacher evaluation, which could encourage international peers to better understand Chinese teacher evaluation policies and promote policy learning and dissemination internationally. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Due to the uniqueness of “one country, two systems” and “two customs territories” in Guangdong (GD) and Hong Kong (HK), cross-border road cargo clearance between the two regions requires the creation of several documents. These include the Road Cargo Manifest, Vehicle Declaration, Customs Declaration, HK Seamless, HK Bundle, and HK Customs Declaration, as well as additional documents such as Packing List, Contract, and more. The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can streamline the process of generating these documents and ensure accuracy and efficiency in cross-border road cargo clearance operations. This paper focuses on four aspects: text scanning and recognition, extraction of commodity classification declaration elements, conversion of customs declaration documents, and intelligent commodity classification. These areas of research aim to address the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of document creation and verification. By leveraging AI technologies, such as optical character recognition (OCR), data extraction algorithms, and machine learning (ML), it is possible to automate and optimize the production and review of these documents, thereby reducing time and manpower costs in cross-border road cargo clearance operations between GD and HK. Based on big data analysis of customs declaration documents from both regions, AI technologies such as feature extraction and machine learning can be utilized to achieve automation in the identification of documents like road cargo manifests and customs declarations. This research applied to the China International Trade Single Window (Shenzhen) and significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of customs declaration in GD and HK. © 2023 SPIE."
"Seaweed has many benefits, serving as a source of highly nutritious food, raw material for the cosmetic industry, pharmaceuticals, and animal feed. Seaweed also plays a crucial role in maintaining environmental ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to understand research trends concerning seaweed. BERTopic is a commonly used method in topic modeling for analyzing scientific publication data. This study aims to find the best model using BERTopic for analyzing scientific publications related to seaweed. This research tests and evaluates the performance of methods such as stopword removal, embedding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering based on topic coherence values to obtain the optimal model. The test results indicate that removing stopwords using CountVectorizer, employing SCIBERT as the transformer, utilizing UMAP as the dimensionality reduction algorithm, and applying k-means as the clustering algorithm yield the best coherence values for analyzing scientific publications related to seaweed. © 2023 IEEE."

"Public procurement plays a crucial role in government operations by acquiring goods and services through competitive bidding processes. However, the increasing volume of procurement data has made manual analysis impractical and time-consuming. Therefore, text clustering and topic modeling techniques have been widely used to uncover hidden patterns in unstructured text data. This paper leverages the power of BERT-based models to overcome the challenges associated with analyzing public procurement data. Specifically, we employ BERTopic, a topic modeling technique based on BERT, to generate clusters that capture the underlying topics in procurement data. Additionally, we evaluate several sentence embedding models for representing procurement documents. By combining BERT-based models and advanced sentence embeddings, we aim to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of topic modeling in public procurement analysis. Our results provide valuable insights into the underlying topics within the data, aiding decision-making processes and improving the efficiency of procurement operations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Sentiment analysis using natural language processing and machine learning techniques can determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in large amounts of text. However, due to the presence of Chinese polysemous words, current sentiment analysis lacks effective analysis for various specific domains. As a result, sentiment analysis in Chinese faces challenges. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel domain-specific sentiment analysis system. The system combines the advantages of two major sentiment analysis methods: lexicon-based sentiment analysis and machine learning analysis. First, the Naive Bayesian classification algorithm is used to extract words, accurately discriminate their emotional polarity, and form an enhanced lexicon suitable for a specific domain. Then, three commonly used machine learning classifiers are used to compare the effects of semantic analysis before and after using the enhanced lexicon. Experimental statistics show that the sentiment orientation accuracy of the Chinese financial commentary sentiment analysis system proposed in this paper can be improved by about 5%. © 2023 IEEE."
"Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing. It is the process of analyzing, processing, generalizing, and reasoning about subjective text with emotional overtones. To cope with sentiment analysis tasks, current deep learning approaches typically use large-scale pre-trained language models and attention mechanisms that apply computed attention weights without any restrictions on attention allocation. This mechanism is not an ideal model for dealing with the task of sentiment analysis, because in all kinds of language used in life, a semantically complete sentence is composed of words with different semantics connected to a complex and diverse grammar. Factors influencing the sentiment tendency of a sentence include the meaning of words and the change in semantics by the superposition of grammars with different structures. This paper proposes a sentiment analysis model that incorporates information about dependency syntax structure. Dependent syntactic information treats words as nodes and establishes syntactic grammatical structures between words by establishing node-to-node relationships. The undirected graph composed of the dependent syntactic structure information screens the text embedding derived from the attention mechanism in multiple layers, so that each layer focuses only on the associated text, and the sentiment classifier uses the text information containing the syntactic structure of the grammar in the classification. Experiments on the Online_Shopping_10_Cats dataset show a significant improvement in the final results compared to current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models. © 2023 SPIE."
"Introduction: The use of telemedicine for the prehospital management of emergency conditions, especially stroke, is increasing day by day. Few studies have investigated the applications of telemedicine in Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A comprehensive study of the applications of this technology in stroke patients in ambulances can help to build a better understanding. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to investigate the use of telemedicine in ambulances for stroke patients in 2023. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Web of Science from 2013 through March 1, 2023. The authors selected the articles based on keywords and criteria and reviewed them in terms of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, the articles that were related to the study aim were evaluated. Results: The initial search resulted in the extraction of 2,795 articles. After review of the articles, and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles were selected for the final analysis. Three (42.85%) studies were on the feasibility and intervention types. Also, randomized trials, feasibility, feasibility and prospective-observational, and feasibility and retrospective-interventional studies were each one (14.28%). Six (85.71%) of the studies were conducted in the United States. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and RP-Xpress were the most commonly used tools for neurological evaluations and teleconsultations. Conclusion: Remote prehospital consultations, triage, and sending patient data before they go to the emergency department can be provided through telemedicine in ambulances. Neurological evaluations via telemedicine are reliable and accurate, and they are almost equal to in-person evaluations by a neurologist.  © 2023 The Author(s).

"The widespread applications of emotion recognition (ER) in various fields have recently attracted much attention from researchers. Consequently, an array of advanced techniques has emerged, driven by enhancing the accuracy and robustness of these recognition systems. As emotional dialogue comprises sound and spoken content, the proposed model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using two separate channels and merges them for emotional classification. The two channels used inputs from audio and text modalities. The audio channel is encoded using a deep convolutional neural network with residual connections and further transformed using a self-attention-based multihead attention network called channel-wise global head pooling. Unlike the vanilla multihead attention network, an adaptive global pooling is used after concatenating all the heads. The text channel is encoded using a pre-trained BERT model. The proposed ER method is validated on four benchmark databases: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture in English, the Berlin emotional speech dataset in the German language, Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song in North American English and Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset in English. The classification accuracy on the above emotional corpora is 85.71%, 79.52%, 76.71% and 73.91%, respectively. Furthermore, cross-corpus analysis is presented to understand the variability of speech and text features and the robustness of the proposed architecture. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare health outcomes for patients receiving acute care in their homes through a Hospital at Home (HaH) program to outcomes for inpatients in the traditional hospital setting. Patients and Methods: We compared outcomes for patients in a HaH program at Virtua Health in 2022 (N = 271) to traditional inpatients during the same year (N = 13,776) with the same diagnoses. We defined outcomes as recommendations for subacute rehabilitation (SAR) upon discharge as this recommendation indicates the need for additional therapy based on a physician’s assessment of the patient. Specifically, we searched notes in the electronic medical records for terms related to recommendation for SAR using text mining algorithms and a natural language processing (NLP) model to confirm these recommendations. We then compared the proportion of patients within each group that had a SAR recommendation, and controlled for differences in sample size, age, and diagnosis using bootstrapping analyses. Results: We observed that the proportion of patients in the HaH program that were recommended for SAR (0.148) was significantly different from the proportion of patients who remained in the traditional hospital setting (0.363), with a reduced need for SAR for HaH patients. We obtained qualitatively similar results when we controlled for sample size and diagnosis. Controlling for age yielded an older control population, and the difference in the proportion of patients with SAR recommendations between the groups widened. Conclusion: The reduced need for SAR for HaH patients in this study suggests that HaH programs are a promising alternative care model. Future work may consider how health outcomes vary for patients with different diagnoses, clinical histories and demographics, which may inform how HaH programs operate moving forward. © 2023 Yadav et al."
"Background: A network meta-analysis aims to help clinicians make clinical decisions on the most effective treatment for a certain condition. Neck pain is multifactorial, with various classification systems and treatment options. Classifying patients and grouping interventions in clinically relevant treatment nodes for a NMA is essential, but this process is poorly defined. Objective: Our aim is to obtain consensus among experts on neck pain classifications and the grouping of interventions into nodes for a future network meta-analysis. Design: A Delphi consensus study involving neck pain experts worldwide. Methods: We invited authors of neck pain clinical practice guidelines published from 2014 onwards. The Delphi baseline questionnaire was developed based on the findings of a scoping review, including four items on classifications and 19 nodes. Participants were asked to record their level of agreement on a seven-point Likert scale or using Yes/No/Not sure answer options for the various statements. We used descriptive analysis to summarise the responses on each statement with content analysis of the free-text comments. Results: In total, 18/80 experts (22.5%) agreed to participate in one or more Delphi rounds. We needed three rounds to reach consensus for two classification of neck pain: one based on aetiology and one on duration. In addition, we also reached consensus on the grouping of interventions, including a definition of each node, with the number of nodes reduced to 17. Conclusion: With this consensus we clinically validated two neck pain classifications and grouped conservative treatments into 17 well-defined and clinically relevant nodes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: The aim of this study was to summarize the existing evidence for the treatment of saphenous veins >10 mm in diameter, to determine whether there were vein size limits for treatment modalities, and to determine if there are specific technical considerations for treatment of large veins. Methods: We searched the literature for reports of treatment methods and outcomes for patients with large-diameter saphenous veins treated with various ablation methods between 1993 and 2023. These studies were evaluated for the size of the vein determined as “large diameter,” type of ablation method, study type, outcomes, adverse events, and any technical considerations noted. A systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. The COVIDENCE software was used for full-text screening and data extraction. Three reviewers reviewed the data, and the content expert served as the tiebreaker. Results: Seventy-one records were identified, of which 24 studies were deemed appropriate for extraction. Most of the studies identified reported outcomes of endovenous thermal ablation modalities. There were fewer studies on non-thermal, non-tumescent techniques, and these studies reported an overall lower occlusion rate compared with endovenous thermal ablation techniques. Conclusions: Large head-to-head trials or randomized controlled that compare all the modalities over a long follow-up duration are yet to be performed. In the existing literature, there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of the study size, design, definition of large veins, site of vein measurement, and follow-up periods, making it challenging to make fair comparisons and draw firm conclusions. Currently available evidence supports the use of endothermal ablation techniques for the treatment of veins >10 mm in diameter as they have a more favorable efficacy and safety profile and have a larger body of evidence available compared with non-thermal, non-tumescent techniques or surgery. © 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery"
"Medieval English monastic houses were used to compile collections of various texts important for them for some reason. There are a number of such cartularies and registers, mostly dated to the 13—15th centuries. Their contents were usually concerned with proving of ownership rights of a religious house (writs, property deeds, rentals, etc.). However, there are copies of some legislative monuments. The content analysis of such compilations allows us to determine which legislative texts were of more importance to the monastic authorities and in which context there was need to right them down. The research is based on the materials of Benedictine Canterbury Cathedral priory, as compared with compilations of some English religious houses. Legislative documents are characteristic for the cartularies of later 13th — early 14th centuries. They are usually set in a separate unit, and their repetition could indicate the authority of these texts. The most frequently reproduced legal text is that of the Magna Carta, which is often accompanied by statutes of Edward I. Thus, the preference is given to the acts contemporary to the compilation. In the Canterbury priory’s collection, these cartularies are connected with Prior Henry Eastry. The comparison with other monastic collections demonstrates that the attention to the legislation was perhaps more pronounced in Canterbury priory than in other religious houses. As a whole, monastic interest in legislative documents was quite sporadic, and it is problematic to deduce their selection logic. © 2023 Ltd ""Integration: Education and Science"".

"Research on the difficulty comparison of different Chinese texts involves multiple fields. Some commonly used methods: Vocabulary Complexity Analysis, Grammar and Semantic Complexity Analysis, Theme and Domain Specialization Analysis, etc. The article attempts to explore a new method for comparing text difficulty by calculating the numerical value of mean dependency distance (MDD). Research analysis: The higher the MDD value, the greater the difficulty of the text; The difficulty of the textbook text increases as the order increases, which also means that the difficulty of the text gradually increases; The difficulty level of Chinese texts in different periods is around the average of 3.662, which also indicates that the MDD value of Chinese texts is higher than that of other languages, and there is statistical support for the higher difficulty level of Chinese texts compared to other languages. © 2023 IEEE."
"The article is devoted to the analysis of ideas about charity in early Christianity, Judaism and in the Greco-Roman pagan tradition. The focus is on the formation of the doctrine of “correct” alms in the New Testament texts, “Didache”, in Clement of Rome, Polycarp of Smyrna, in the “Shepherd” of Hermas, in the writings of Justin Martyr, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria. These authors discussed questions about who and how to help, and what kind of reward awaits benefactors. At this time (1st — 2nd centuries), two discussions were going on in parallel in early Christian literature: about martyrdom “according to Christ” and about “correct” alms, and comparison of these discussions gives interesting results. © 2023 Ltd ""Integration: Education and Science"".

"Military conflict is a global concern, and as global conflicts continue to grow in number and complexity, the need to quickly and accurately understand the temporal relationships of conflict events is becoming more pressing. Analyses of the course of conflict events by military analysts, intelligence officers are crucial in war prevention, intervention and conflict resolution. Extracting event timing relationships from a large number of conflict-related texts in open source journalism can help researchers and policy makers better understand the evolution of conflicts and the causal relationships behind them. However, there are fewer current studies on event temporal relationship extraction from Chinese texts, while the accuracy of current temporal relationship studies is low. In this paper, we construct a chapter-level Chinese military conflict event temporal relationship dataset. In order to extract the event relationships in the document, the whole document is coded using Roberta, contextual extraction of multi-featured Chinese military conflict event trigger words is performed with additional classification headers, and contextual repetitions of different event pairs corresponding to the location of event triggers are sent as inputs, and then the model is fine-tuned. classification of event pairs labels using a linear layer. This method is more effective for the task of event temporal relationship extraction. The text constructs a Chinese military event conflict event dataset, and the experimental results show that the recall F1 based on this method reaches 0.63, which is slightly higher than the current mainstream benchmark model. © 2023 IEEE."
"In Yus (2022a, 2022b), a corpus of humorous interactions on the messaging app WhatsApp was analysed, aiming to isolate their recurrent turn-taking variations. The analysis yielded several patterns depending on the quality of the first turn in the messaging conversation: (a) humorous text, (b) humorous text plus emoji, (c) non-humorous text, (d) non-humorous text plus emoji, (e) image, (f) image plus humorous text; (g) image plus non-humorous text; and (h) video. The objective of the present study is to compare these humorous interactions with those carried out in a different cultural environment (China), and a different messaging application (WeChat). The analysis will first focus on the (dis)similarities in the “interface affordances” of these two applications and then will address the ways in which the users from these cultures (Spain, China) carry out their humorous messaging interactions. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Nowadays, a company's reputation is a main determinant of its success; it is beneficial for companies to be aware of what observers are saying about them in the media so that they may respond correctly. The proposed system is a website application that facilitates staying up to date with the latest mentions of companies. The system allows clients to enter keywords that represent what they want to monitor and select the media platforms they want to search. Our website application supports different media platforms, including social media platforms, blogs and articles, radio stations, podcasts, and television. Various tools and APIs implement data gathering from these platforms. The system accesses Twitter through the Twitter API v2, blogs and articles through the Bing Search API, and accesses podcasts through the iTunes Search API, and YouTube, television and radio using the y_dl tool. Audio preprocessing is implemented on the retrieved audio files, after which the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) process is achieved using the Google Web Speech API, followed by the text preprocessing phase. The system detects the keyword mentions and alerts clients with the awaited context. It processes the data received to provide clients with data visualization on a web application after the data processing and analysis phase, which essentially includes sentiment analysis using the Mazajak API operating on a Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model as well as topic modelling using BERTopic and text summarization using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to decide if the underlying sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Subjective information from the text can be extracted using sentiment analysis by recognizing its context and position. Data from a variety of sources, like social network comments, news stories, consumer reviews, and more, can be used for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis uses different algorithms to analyze words, phrases, and context available in text and different procedures to determine the overall sentiment communicated. There are various ways in which sentiment analysis is performed, ranging from rule-based methods that use lists of positive and negative terms as labeled data for training machine learning algorithms to building classifiers. Understanding social sentiment, underlying intents, and responses to various characteristics of humans can be done with the help of sentiment analysis, which helps in decision-making. The primary goal of this work is to provide the audience with the knowledge needed to understand sentiment analysis, highlight potential opportunities and challenges, and investigate recent studies that have been published in reputable resources focusing on the field of sentiment analysis in NLP. © (2023), (Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia).

"The article analyzes the subject of interethnic relations in the interpretation of the Russian citizen of Polish origin Marian Edmundovich Zdziechowski — linguist, theorist of Russian literature, religious thinker, philosopher, publicist, and public figure. Researchers from many Slavic countries turn to the study of the ideological heritage by Zdziechowski, since his sphere of research interests, as he claimed it himself, was centred at “the study of Slavs”. While we acknowledge the extensive work done in this field, we must admit that works by Zdziechowsk published in Russian periodicals of the pre-revolutionary period are still insufficiently introduced by modern scholars into their studies. That is the gap which this article seeks to fill. The article presents and analyzes the Zdziechowski’s opinions on the current system of interethnic relations in Imperial Russia and the cultural policy of that epoch regarding national minorities. is the authors show that, in presenting his views, Zdziechowski relied on the authoritative opinions on this issue of well-known Russian cultural figures of the time: Leo Tolstoy, B. N. Chicherin, G. N. Trubetskoy, A. N. Pypin, and V. D. Spasovich. Although Zdziechowski considered the problems of interethnic relations mainly at the example of the analysis of Russian state policy towards Poles living in the country, his views are regarded as important for understanding the nature of the imperial ethnic policy, in general. The editors of Moskovsky Ezhenedelnik, and Novoe Zveno, where his texts were published, give their appraisals of the activity of Zdziechowski. The evolution of the thinker’s views from the expressions of hope for a beneficial solution of the Polish question to the emergence of a sense of disappointment and pessimism is traced in the article. The coverage of this problem in the historical perspective reveals the ambiguity of its interpretations and solutions in the past and might help to improve the national policy in modern Russia. © St. Petersburg State University, 2023."
"Pre-trained models usually come with a predefined tokenization and little flexibility as to what subword tokens can be used in downstream tasks. This problem concerns especially multilingual NLP and low-resource languages, which are typically processed using cross-lingual transfer. In this paper, we aim to find out if the right granularity of tokenization is helpful for a text classification task, namely dialect classification. Aiming at generalizations beyond the studied cases, we look for the optimal granularity in four dialect datasets, two with relatively consistent writing (one Arabic and one Indo-Aryan set) and two with considerably inconsistent writing (one Arabic and one Swiss German set). To gain more control over subword tokenization and ensure direct comparability in the experimental settings, we train a CNN classifier from scratch comparing two subword tokenization methods (Unigram model and BPE). For reference, we compare the results obtained in our analysis to the state of the art achieved by fine-tuning pre-trained models. We show that models trained from scratch with an optimal tokenization level perform better than fine-tuned classifiers in the case of highly inconsistent writing. In the case of relatively consistent writing, fine-tuned models remain better regardless of the tokenization level. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"In the semantic theory of Gottlob Frege, the content of a linguistic sign is determined by the connection between the meaning and a set of subjective perceptions that form the meaning. Our study aims to reveal the influence of individual perceptions of the meaning on the extension of the semantic structure of a word, using the kinship term ‘mamochka’ as an example. The article focuses on instances where the word ‘mamochka’ is used in fiction and, to some extent, Internet texts. The article examines cases spanning from the 1840s to the 2010s to explore the secondary usage of the term. The corpus, comprising a total of 2,192 cases, was carefully collected and annotated. Out of these cases, 362 examples were identified as instances of secondary usage. Each example was analyzed and categorized based on its type of use, including appellative (address), referential, or interjective use. Furthermore, for the secondary instances, the type of the meaning was also marked for accurate classification and analysis. The study delineated the semantic structure of the word ‘mamochka’ based on its various uses. Common meanings encompassed appellative and referential usages, denoting a wife, a woman fulfilling maternal roles, or a woman with a young child. Additionally, unique meanings emerged for specific contexts, such as a friend, a man, a non-living object, or even the caretaker of an animal. The investigation also uncovered systemic connections among these meanings, along with the dynamic transformations they underwent over time in the diachronic aspect. © Кронгауз М. А., Клокова К.

"This article reports on the search for the author of the textbook titled Voor wie Nederlands wil leren [For those who want to learn Dutch]. The article presents as literary fiction with some elements of scientific data in the field of forensic linguistics. The aim was to create a psycholinguistic profile of the author and to show how fascinating it is to study a linguistic fingerprint. When identifying the author of a written text, the expert looks for characteristic linguistic features, analysing lexical, syntactic and grammatical elements, as well as linguistic errors. At the same time, particular attention is paid to the specific vocabulary used by the author of the text (e.g. neologisms, archaisms, borrowings, dialectisms) as well as to stylistic devices (e.g. metaphors, paradoxes, hyperboles). These elements form the so-called idiolect, i.e. the specific language of the individual. Each person uses their own specific and characteristic language, which reflects their education, life experiences, profession or age. Based on an analysis of the linguistic properties of the text, and taking into account psychological knowledge, attempts can also be made to draw conclusions about the emotions experienced by the author. A detailed study of the text on a linguistic, content and psychological level enables the drawing of a psycholinguistic portrait of the presumed author. © 2023 American Veterinary Medical Association.

The material basis of the analysis consisted of texts from the four oldest Warsaw newspapers: “Merkuriusz Polski” (the beginning of 17th century), “Kurier Polski” and “Gazeta Warszawska” (18th century) and “Kurier Warszawski” (the beginning of 19th century). This genre analysis led to the formulation of a hypothesis that the press genres such as obituary, memorial note, and profile (with its variants) originated in the 17th-century press texts announcing the death of a person. The primary aim, which was to inform about the death, was complemented by other goals, depending on the epoch, the communication needs of the community and other contextual conditions (e.g. the technical abilities of the press), which in time gave rise to new variants/variations of genres, and over time, to separate genre forms. © 2023, Society of Friends of the Polish Language.

"In recent years, there has been a growing scholarly interest in employing quantitative methods to analyze literary texts, as they offer unique insights, theories, and interpretations. In light of this, the current study employs quantitative analysis to examine the fiction written by the renowned British adventure novelist Sir Henry Rider Haggard. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the affective content and prevalence of distinctive linguistic features in six of Haggard’s most distinguished works. We evaluate dominant emotional states at the sentence level as well as investigate the deployment of specific linguistic features such as modifiers and deontic modals, and collocated terms. Through sentence-level emotion analysis, the findings reveal a notable prevalence of joy-related emotions across the novels. Furthermore, the study observes that intensifiers are employed more commonly than the mitigators as modifiers and the collocated terms of modifiers exhibit high similarity across the novels. By integrating quantitative analyses with qualitative assessments, this study presents a novel perspective on the patterns of emotion and specialized grammatical features in some of Haggard’s most celebrated literary works. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This article focuses on the specification of the hypothesis of the relationship between religiosity and fertility in Russia. On the surface, the situation looks like a paradox, i.e., on the one hand, Churches and religions are generally known to support childbearing values; religious people are believed to have more children than nonreligious people; but, on the other hand, in Russia religiosity has been growing in recent years, but the birth rate has been falling. Despite the fact that in contemporary Russia a large part of the population identifies with Orthodoxy and the number of such people is growing, family and marriage norms characteristic of Orthodoxy, in particular those related to the ideal of large families, are not actually being put into practice. This article proposes to consider mechanisms that might explain this circumstance. In order to specify the hypothesis of the potential influence of religion on the fertility, a literature review was prepared, followed by the identification of key potentially important variables. Three approaches (and correspondingly three groups of texts) have been identified; they analysed the relationship between religion and fertility, namely the reduction of religion to individual religiosity; reduction of religion to a set of extra-religious variables; and, finally, the analysis of religion as an environment and community. The use of the resources of the first two approaches does not allow us to formulate a hypothesis in order to explain today’s Russian paradox of religion and fertility. It is possible to formulate an explanatory hypothesis based on the third class of texts. Kevin McQuillan’s study is used to construct a hypothesis and to specify a vocabulary of variables about the Russian paradox. He identifies three aspects of the religious situation (pro-natalist doctrine, strong religious institutions, strong religious identity), which, in his opinion, can only work together to ensure that the principles preached by religion are actually put to practice. Based on the distinction made by C. McQuillan, as well as on the research of the third group of authors mentioned above, we show that the contemporary Russian Orthodoxy cannot fully rely on any of these mechanisms of influence on believers, which, presumably, can explain the lack of an appropriate influence on their decisions in matters of family and marriage. © 2023 St. Tikhon's University.

"How do people internalize visualizations: as images or information? In this study, we investigate the nature of internalization for visualizations (i.e., how the mind encodes visualizations in memory) and how memory encoding affects its retrieval. This exploratory work examines the influence of various design elements on a user&#x0027;s perception of a chart. Specifically, which design elements lead to perceptions of visualization as an image (aims to provide visual references, evoke emotions, express creativity, and inspire philosophic thought) or as information (aims to present complex data, information, or ideas concisely and promote analytical thinking)? Understanding how design elements contribute to viewers perceiving a visualization more as an image or information will help designers decide which elements to include to achieve their communication goals. For this study, we annotated 500 visualizations and analyzed the responses of 250 online participants, who rated the visualizations on a bilinear scale as &#x2018;image&#x2019; or &#x2018;information.&#x2019; We then conducted an in-person study (n = 101) using a free recall task to examine how the image/information ratings and design elements impacted memory. The results revealed several interesting findings: Image-rated visualizations were perceived as more aesthetically &#x2018;appealing,&#x2019; &#x2018;enjoyable,&#x2019; and &#x2018;pleasing.&#x2019; Information-rated visualizations were perceived as less &#x2018;difficult to understand&#x2019; and more aesthetically &#x2018;likable&#x2019; and &#x2018;nice,&#x2019; though participants expressed higher &#x2018;positive&#x2019; sentiment when viewing image-rated visualizations and felt less &#x2018;guided to a conclusion.&#x2019; The presence of axes and text annotations heavily influenced the likelihood of participants rating the visualization as &#x2018;information.&#x2019; We also found different patterns among participants that were older. Importantly, we show that visualizations internalized as &#x2018;images&#x2019; are less effective in conveying trends and messages, though they elicit a more positive emotional judgment, while &#x2018;informative&#x2019; visualizations exhibit annotation focused recall and elicit a more positive design judgment. We discuss the implications of this dissociation between aesthetic pleasure and perceived ease of use in visualization design. IEEE"
"Early modern economic thought is often left out of histories of economic thought, but it was an important inflection point in the development of the modern science of economics. Using network clustering and topic modeling, this research describes the subjects covered in the economic literature of the early modern era and how they change over time using a sample of 2,353 economics texts written from 1550 to 1700s. Topic modeling of the corpus produces sixty-six distinct topics. These topics are clustered using network science methods that reveal five main themes: trade, politics, travel, religion, and husbandry. Longitudinal analysis of the prevalence of topics shows increases in politics and decreases in travel, religion, and husbandry. The results also allow a more precise sense of when those shifts take place than has previously been established, implying that computational methods hold great promise for revealing new information and insights about the evolution and transformation of economic thought over time. © 2023 Scientific Publishers.

"This paper proposes a sentiment-centric pipeline to perform unsupervised plot extraction on non-linear novels like Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, a novel widely considered to be “plotless.” Combining transformer-based sentiment analysis models with statistical testing, we model sentiment’s rate-of-change and correspondingly segment the novel into emotionally self-contained units qualitatively evaluated to be meaningful surrogate pseudo-chapters. We validate our findings by evaluating our pipeline as a fully unsupervised text segmentation model, achieving a F-1 score of 0.643 (regional) and 0.214 (exact) in chapter break prediction on a validation set of linear novels with existing chapter structures. In addition, we observe notable differences between the distributions of predicted chapter lengths in linear and non-linear fictional narratives, with the latter exhibiting significantly greater variability. Our results hold significance for narrative researchers appraising methods for extracting plots from non-linear novels. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts on society, including public health, the economy, daily life, and social interactions. Social distancing measures, travel restrictions, and the influx of pandemic-related information on social media have all led to a significant shift in how individuals perceive and respond to health crises. In this context, there is a growing awareness of the role that social media platforms such as Weibo, among the largest and most influential social media sites in China, play in shaping public sentiment and influencing people’s behavior during public health emergencies. Objective: This study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sociospatial impact of mass epidemic infectious disease by analyzing the spatiotemporal variations and emotional orientations of the public after the COVID-19 pandemic. We use the outbreak of influenza A after the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Through temporal and spatial analyses, we aim to uncover specific variations in the attention and emotional orientations of people living in different provinces in China regarding influenza A. We sought to understand the societal impact of large-scale infectious diseases and the public’s stance after the COVID-19 pandemic to improve public health policies and communication strategies. Methods: We selected Weibo as the data source and collected all influenza A–related Weibo posts from November 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. These data included user names, geographic locations, posting times, content, repost counts, comments, likes, user types, and more. Subsequently, we used latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling to analyze the public’s focus as well as the bidirectional long short-term memory model to conduct emotional analysis. We further classified the focus areas and emotional orientations of different regions. Results: The research findings indicate that, compared with China’s western provinces, the eastern provinces exhibited a higher volume of Weibo posts, demonstrating a greater interest in influenza A. Moreover, inland provinces displayed elevated levels of concern compared with coastal regions. In addition, female users of Weibo exhibited a higher level of engagement than male users, with regular users comprising the majority of user types. The public’s focus was categorized into 23 main themes, with the overall emotional sentiment predominantly leaning toward negativity (making up 7562 out of 9111 [83%] sentiments). Conclusions: The results of this study underscore the profound societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. People tend to be pessimistic toward new large-scale infectious diseases, and disparities exist in the levels of concern and emotional sentiments across different regions. This reflects diverse societal responses to health crises. By gaining an in-depth understanding of the public’s attitudes and focal points regarding these infectious diseases, governments and decision makers can better formulate policies and action plans to cater to the specific needs of different regions and enhance public health awareness. ©Jing Dai, Fang Lyu, Lin Yu, Yunyu He."
"Classification between relevant and irrelevant data is one of the most important tasks in modern machine learning. This paper developes a semi-supervised classification methods that is based on partially defined information for a text source. The method is based on the analysis of the author’s engagement into the subject area and the combination of his assessment by readers with quality of published texts. To achieve this we used a combination of joint author and text analysis that allowed to significantly reduce workload for further data markup. The method uses a learning loop that balances class attribution probabilities for text data at the level of the most effective class separation for a given noise level in the data. It was found that different paths for estimating relevance probability for relevant and irrelevant records had to be used. Both likelihood and plausibility approaches were used to achieve acceptable level of classification. The method was developed in process of analysys of large number of texts from social networks. It showed high effectiveness on a large amount (&gt;70 mln records, &gt;8 mln unique authors) of confusingly similar text data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The paper characterizes military travelogues about the War of 1812 and the foreign campaigns of the Russian army of 1813–1814 in the aspect of the authorship problem. The focus is on three texts that provide a better representation of various ways of describing military events by narrators. These are “Pohodnye zapiski artillerista (Field notes of an artilleryman), 1812–1816” by I. T. Radozhitsky, “Pisma russkogo ofitsera (Letters of a Russian officer)” by F. N. Glinka, and “Pokhodnye zapiski russkogo ofitsera, izdannye I. Lazhechnikovym (Field notes of a Russian officer published by I. I. Lazhechnikov)” by I. I. Lazhechnikov. The analysis evaluates the ratio of the “biographical author” and the subject of the narrative. A new type of narrator, the “Russian officer,” is specified versus the popular type of the “Russian sensitive traveler” characteristic of the “Karamzin canon.” The types of the subjects of the military travelogue narrative of the 10–20ies of the 19th century are identified and characterized. These are: “sentimental Russian officer,” a patriot, “an outside military observer,” and “a private man at war.” A detailed description of these types is provided. On the one hand, they are defined as variants of the type presented in the “Karamzin canon.” On the other hand, they are regarded as fundamental innovations of the authors of travelogues, demonstrating the specificity of the evolution of the genre in the 19th century. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"High-quality early childhood education and care (ECEC)–particularly care defined by highly responsive interactions between educators and children–has the potential to have lasting positive impacts on children’s development. While there is variability in the level of quality among early education and care settings, professional development for early childhood educators has been shown to be an effective means to improve both ECEC quality and child outcomes. As many professional development programs are time and resource intensive, we sought out to test the efficacy of a brief (5 hr) professional development program that included a workshop, individual coaching, video feedback and text messaging. Research Findings: Results of a cluster randomized controlled trial with 93 educators indicated that the program improved educators’ responsivity three-months after intervention (d = 0.60, p =.035), but not classroom-wide levels of emotional support or instructional quality. Trend analysis revealed the greatest improvements occurred after the workshop and first coaching session and leveled off over time. Practice or Policy: Preliminary evidence suggests brief professional development programs may improve interaction quality with effect sizes comparable to those of longer programs. Well-powered studies using multiple arms or sequential randomization will help optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of professional development. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Acquiring a good level of Estonian as a second language is very important for the students at secondary school to successfully continue their studies and to smoothly integrate into the Estonian society. To encourage students’ desire to learn and increase the effectiveness of learning, activity, engagement, and afford-ability are very important during language classes (Kitsnik 2018b). Reading is one of four skills that is developed at second language classes. The aim of the current action research was to develop more effective learning where gamified teaching methods were used. Based on the aim of the research, there were raised research question, whether more interesting and systematic reading classes can be used to make reading books in Estonian more pleasant for students with other mother tongues and to support the development of language skills. In the action research the previous reading classes were developed methodically of one of the study groups in grade 8 (n 15). 15 consciously structured reading classes were compiled based on Andrus Kivirähk’s book ”Tont ja Face-book” (”The Ghost and Facebook” 2019). The plan was made on the basis of gamified teaching methods (Kitsnik 2019a, 2019b; Razin & Kingisepp 2018; Kingisepp & Kärtner 2011 etc.). Gamification offers challenges, creates excite-ment, frees students from the rules and restrictions of everyday life, offers joy, fun and energy (Kitsnik 2019a). The reading classes were conducted from November 2021 to March 2022, usually once a week instead of one ordinary Estonian language lesson. The other three lessons a week took place in the usual way. Reading classes were consciously structured. Before each class, the students read at home a story from the book and completed a reading comprehension task. Four types of tasks were used at the classes: tasks related to understanding the content of the story being read, tasks related to learning vocabulary, tasks related to speaking about a text and tasks related to discussing what was read. At all classes, attention was paid to the engagement, activity, and affordability of the learning activities for the students. The purpose of tasks supporting reading was to teach students reading strategies and help them focus on what was important. The aim of the comprehension tasks was to ensure that all students understood the content of the story and could actively participate in further activities. The purpose of the vocabulary tasks was to repeat, learn and consolidate words and phrases related to the stories read. The aim of the speaking activities was to make the students talk about the topic they were reading and to use the vocabulary of the story. The purpose of the discussion tasks was to make students think more deeply about the content of the story they were reading and to find the connections between the story and real life. The tasks included predicting, illustrating a text, retelling and arranging the story, pantomimes, performances, storytelling, brainstorming etc. During the lessons, teacher filled in the teacher’s research diary. Students’ feedback was collected with questionnaires (rating scales and open-ended questions) and the development of students’ reading skills – with the help of secondary school Estonian exam reading tests. In conclusion, the results showed that the students’ attitude towards reading classes became much more positive during the action research. The students’ attitudes towards reading Estonian texts also became more positive. The development of reading skills in the study group did not differ significantly from the development in the control group. The analysis of the teacher’s diary showed that the tasks based on the gamified teaching methods were engaging for students (created joy and excitement), active (involved a lot of movement, acting, communicating and talking) and affordable (supported understanding and cooperation in Estonian fiction and communication in Estonian). © 2023, Estonian Association Applied Linguists.

"It is understood that architecture is a representation of ideas. Often, they can also represent meanings embedded in other buildings. The Puro Mangkunegaran building is often seen as a representation of the Javanese Palace in Indonesia. This study employs a descriptive qualitative method with an interpretive analysis. It critically sees the Puro Mangkunegaran building from cultural studies paradigm as a text in the form of a constructed representation. The study used Stuart Hall's Representation theory. The study found that the elements used in the Puro Mangkunegaran building are represented as a conceptual construction of textual meaning through agreed upon terms. The links between concepts and language that transforms real objects of spatial layout in the Puro Mangkunegaran building elements such as Bale kencur, Bale peni, Bale warni, Dalem ageng, Gedhong wireng, Karti pura, and Kasatriyan etc., have manifested philosophical or meaningful terms for the Javanese Palace and its supporting community. Representation in the Puro Mangkunegaran building are based on ideas in the minds of Javanese communities expressed through agreed-upon cultural terms embedded in the concepts of Tri Ugering Ngaurip including Wirya (care), Arto (welfare), and Winasis (science). The representation of the concept confirmed two principles: first, to interpret something in the sense of explaining it in the mind using imagination, and second, to place this equation before in the Javanese people’s thoughts or feelings. The words used to describe the elements of the building were designed to establish harmony between the occupants and their surroundings for Mangkunegaran IV. © (2023), (Center for Cities).

"Transformer is a neural network model whose trend is rising because ChatGPT shocked the world with its general answering and questioning system capabilities. The bidirectional encoder representation transformer (BERT) is also one of the other pre-Trained transformer models. However, there are research opportunities to use BERT in sentiment analysis for the Rotten Tomatoes review. Our research aims to use BERT for sentiment analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset and evaluate the results. Our research step is to get the Rotten Tomatoes dataset from the Huggingface dataset. We do pre-processing for the BERT model, tune the BERT model, then train the model using the dataset. We use the lightweight pre-Trained DistilBERT as part of our proposed model. We compare the performance of our BERT model with three state-of-The-Art benchmark methods: support vector machine with term frequency-inverse document frequency (SVM+TF-IDF), naïve Bayes with TF-IDF (NB+TF-IDF), and convolutional neural network (CNN). We use several test metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating curve (ROC). In the training optimization process, we learned that AdamW is more effective than Adam optimizer. Our test results show that BERT's performance is better than the other three models with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Scores of 0.753, 0.754, 0.754, and 0.753, respectively. Finally, BERT is also the best in terms of AUC, with a value of 0.826.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Sentiment Analysis is analyzing text and extracting information like negative or positive opinion. It is also known as opinion mining. Due to the increase in social media usage sentiment analysis has become increasingly important as there is a lot of human generated data for example comments, reviews etc. that can be used to understand the sentiments of a person. Large organizations work on sentiment analysis systems. This system helps them in real world data analytics such as customer reviews on their product, brand engagement, surveys, etc. Moreover, this review paper encompasses a concise summary of relevant research papers, providing a holistic view of the advancements in sentiment analysis. By unraveling the techniques and exploring the challenges, this paper aims to contribute to the deeper understanding of sentiment analysis, paving the way for future improvements in this field. © 2023 IEEE."
"Currently, when the English language has established itself as a lingua franca in academic settings, it is relevant to investigate rhetorical strategies in texts produced by L2 writers who use English in their academic prose. This paper explores lexical patterns of hedging in Englishmedium research article abstracts written by L2 (Russian) writers from two fields representing hard sciences and humanities — engineering and linguistics. The main focus is on quantitative and qualitative variations in the lexical realizations of hedging as a metadiscourse strategy used to present research results and enter into a dialogue with the reader. The corpus comprises 312 engineering and linguistics research article abstracts taken equally from six Russian linguistic and engineering journals. In order to investigate hedging devices and their lexical categories, this study adopted the methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results of the quantitative analysis show that there are many differences in the distribution of lexical patterns of hedging in the two sub-corpora. In the engineering abstracts, hedging was most frequently realized through modal auxiliaries and adverbs of frequency. In the linguistics subcorpus, probability nouns and reporting verbs were among the most frequent lexical patterns of hedging. In the linguistics abstracts, hedging was realized through a greater variety of lexical categories. This suggests that lexical realizations of hedging seem to be influenced by the discipline rather than generic conventions. © St. Petersburg State University, 2023."
"The article examines the phenomenon of (media)presence as a projectional embodiment of objects in theatre. The aim is to describe techniques of using projectional surfaces and devices in performances, using as material Western European productions of the 2000s and 2010s. We attempt to identify and elucidate the modes of presence through the use of projectional images in theatre. The theoretical and methodological framework employed in the article includes a set of ideas at the intersection of theatre, visual, and media studies. Such a framework makes it possible to define performance as a visual event — the act of looking, and to shift the focus from technological artifacts to the processes of mediation of presence by projectional images. We introduce the concept of “(media)presence” as relevant for a productive description of the phenomenon. (Media)presence is the effect of being in the perceptual field of objects of perception, when their physical absence is compensated for by the presence of their screen substitutes. The use of projectional technologies in theatre allows one to achieve the effect of (media)presence through mediation of “life” performances. The ways in which directors utilize projectional surfaces and devices activate several modes of performative embodiment of perceptional objects through projectional images: “absent”, “composite” and “augmented” (media)presence. The text offers a complex analysis of practices of using projectional images in contemporary theatre aimed at achieving the effect of (media)presence. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"It is well known that filtering low-quality data before pretraining language models or selecting suitable data from domains similar to downstream task datasets generally leads to improved downstream performance. However, the extent to which the quality of a corpus, in particular its complexity, affects its downstream performance remains less explored. In this work, we address the problem of creating a suitable pretraining corpus given a fixed corpus budget. Using metrics of text complexity we propose a simple yet effective approach for constructing a corpus with rich lexical variation. Our extensive set of empirical analyses reveal that such a diverse and complex corpus yields significant improvements over baselines consisting of less diverse and less complex corpora when evaluated in the context of general language understanding tasks. © 2023 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

"Background: Identifying hereditary parkinsonism is valuable for diagnosis, genetic counseling, patient prioritization in trials, and studying the disease for personalized therapies. However, most studies were conducted in Europeans, and limited data exist on admixed populations like those from Latin America. Objectives: This study aims to assess the frequency and distribution of genetic parkinsonism in Latin America. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the frequency of parkinsonian syndromes associated with genetic pathogenic variants in Latin America. We defined hereditary parkinsonism as those caused by the genes outlined by the MDS Nomenclature of Genetic Movement Disorders and heterozygous carriers of GBA1 pathogenic variants. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and LILACS in August 2022. Researchers reviewed titles and abstracts, and disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. After this screening, five researchers reanalyzed the selection criteria and extracted information based on the full paper. The frequency for each parkinsonism-related gene was determined by the presence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants among screened patients. Cochran's Q and I2 tests were used to quantify heterogeneity. Meta-regression, publication bias tests, and sensitivity analysis regarding study quality were also used for LRRK2-, PRKN-, and GBA1-related papers. Results: We included 73 studies involving 3014 screened studies from 16 countries. Among 7668 Latin American patients, pathogenic variants were found in 19 different genes. The frequency of the pathogenic variants in LRRK2 was 1.38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–2.57), PRKN was 1.16% (95% CI: 0.08–3.05), and GBA1 was 4.17% (95% CI: 2.57–6.08). For all meta-analysis, heterogeneity was high and publication bias tests were negative, except for PRKN, which was contradictory. Information on the number of pathogenic variants in the other genes is further presented in the text. Conclusions: This study provides insights into hereditary and GBA1-related parkinsonism in Latin America. Lower GBA1 frequencies compared to European/North American cohorts may result from limited access to gene sequencing. Further research is vital for regional prevalence understanding, enabling personalized care and therapies. © 2023 The Authors.

"The number of users and daily tweets on Twitter is among the highest of all social media outlets. New forms of communication like social media greatly contribute to the rapid treatment of panic amid global health crises like pandemics. The purpose of this research is to examine and evaluate the tone of the Tweets that were posted during the MONKEYPOX disease, for that purpose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN, and a hybrid model of CNN-LSTM is used, in this the negative and positive sentiment classes of tweets are found. The findings indicate that there is only a tiny difference between positive and negative tweets, which highlights the necessity for attention to be paid to increase awareness and, as a consequence, decrease negativity. In addition, the LSTM was able to accurately predict the sentiment classes (Negative and Positive), with an accuracy rate of 72.15%. CNN with an accuracy of 82% and hybrid model CNN-LSTM with an accuracy of 91% The great accuracy leads one to the conclusion that Hybrid model CNN-LSTM is capable of adapting to new situations and predicting the emotion of a text. © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: The use of anabolic androgenic steroids among recreational athletes has received growing attention in recent decades. Several countries have implemented bans on doping; however, recreational athletes and other subpopulations continue to use doping substances. Recognizing that the police play a crucial role in preventing the use and dealing of doping substances in Sweden, efforts have been made to intensify police interventions and enhance collaboration with other key actors. This study examined police officers’ perceptions of doping as defined in Swedish law, related problems, and suggestions for effective prevention of doping in the society. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a web survey of police officers (N = 597). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and free-form text responses were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Participant responses to the survey (73.7% response rate) indicated that approximately 62.6% thought that doping is a societal problem, and approximately 26% perceived that the availability of doping substances has increased over the past three years. A total of 95.6% of respondents believed that doping occurred in connection with other crimes such as intimate partner violence (88.2%) and drug-related crimes (88.0%). Further, 96.3% of respondents perceived that it was their duty to prevent doping, but 63.8% indicated that doping-related work was not prioritized within their local police district. Discussion: Police officers perceived doping as a societal problem and expressed motivation to counteract it, highlighting increased knowledge, legislative changes, intensified doping prevention in gyms, and commitment from other societal actors to increase the effectiveness of doping prevention. Suggestions for increasing the efficiency of doping prevention included education and increased knowledge at all levels in the police organization, intensified prevention efforts at gyms, legislative changes to permit simplified doping test procedures, and breach of secrecy for postal items. There was also a suggestion for further engagement from other actors, such as healthcare workers, school officials, and non-governmental organizations. 2023 Kvillemo, Gripenberg, Strandberg and Elgán."
"Introduction: Commonly used isotonic arthroscopic irrigation fluids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's, were initially formulated for intravenous administration so they do not replicate the physiologic properties of healthy synovial fluid. Synovial fluid plays an important role in regulating joint homeostasis so even transient disruptions in joint physiology can be impactful. Previous studies suggest that hyperosmolar solutions may be a promising alternative to traditional isotonic fluids. This manuscript sought to systematically review and synthesize previously published basic science, translational, and clinical studies on the use of hyperosmolar arthroscopic irrigation fluids to delineate the optimal fluid for clinical use. Methods: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search phrases were: (cartilage AND hyperosmolar); (arthroscopy OR arthroscopic AND hyperosmolar). The titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened for studies on hyperosmolar solutions and articular cartilage. Study quality was assessed, and relevant data were collected. A meta-analysis was not performed due to study heterogeneity. A risk of bias assessment was performed on the included translational and clinical trials. Results: There were 10 basic science studies, 2 studies performed in translational animal models, and 2 clinical studies included in this review. Of the basic science studies, 7 utilized a mechanical injury model. The translational studies were carried out in the canine shoulder and equine stifle (knee) joint. Clinical studies were performed in the shoulder and knee. Conclusions: Multiple basic science, translational, and clinical studies highlight the short-term safety, cost-effectiveness, and potential benefits associated with use of hyperosmolar solutions for arthroscopic irrigation. Further work is needed to develop and validate the ideal formulation for a hyperosmolar irrigation solution with long-term benefits for patients undergoing arthroscopic surgeries. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

"Fifteen countries recently signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and formed the world's largest trade bloc between some of the globe's largest and fastest-growing economies. Employing a text-as-data analysis, this article systematically compares the text of the RCEP to the previous agreements of its members to determine the sources of language in the RCEP and investigate why particular treaty text is replicated more frequently relative to others. The results indicate that language derived from the multiparty and multicontinental trade agreements of the United States, a state not involved in the RCEP negotiations, accounted for a disproportionate share of the finalized text. These findings highlight the temporal dimension of power asymmetries as well as the importance of treaty design itself in the diffusion of regulatory norms and suggest that specific trade agreements serve as reference points for subsequent agreements.  © Nicholas Frank, 2023."
"In this article, we applied distant viewing to a corpus of 17,897 comic strips from Charles Schulz’s Peanuts as a primary case study. Distant viewing uses computational techniques to study large-scale visual media, and draws upon interdisciplinary areas including visual media studies, cultural studies, data science, and semiotics. We focus on comic strips, particularly Peanuts, due to their widespread readership, historical and cultural cache, and complexity as a medium built on the interplay between text, image, and meaning. First, we discuss previous work done at the intersections of comics studies and computer vision. Next, we establish the processes for applying computer vision to comic strips. After that, we provide several examples, including: panel detection (variations in panel length over a cartoonist’s career); caption detection (identification and location of captions in panels); and comics paratext (computer vision analyses/exclusions of copyright text, signatures, dates, etc.). Combined studies of panel detection, caption detection, and comics paratext reveals new insights into the success, longevity, and influence of one of the world’s most famous newspaper comic strips. Ultimately, computer vision reveals a subtle stability and symmetry to Schulz’s artistry that played an understudied but significant role in the comic strip’s popularity. © 2023, Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, McGill University.

"Scene-text image synthesis techniques that aim to naturally compose text instances on background scene images are very appealing for training deep neural networks due to their ability to provide accurate and comprehensive annotation information. Prior studies have explored generating synthetic text images on two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces using rules derived from real-world observations. Some of these studies have proposed generating scene-text images through learning; however, owing to the absence of a suitable training dataset, unsupervised frameworks have been explored to learn from existing real-world data, which might not yield reliable performance. To ease this dilemma and facilitate research on learning-based scene text synthesis, we introduce DecompST, a real-world dataset prepared from some public benchmarks, containing three types of annotations: quadrilateral-level BBoxes, stroke-level text masks, and text-erased images. Leveraging the DecompST dataset, we propose a Learning-Based Text Synthesis engine (LBTS) that includes a text location proposal network (TLPNet) and a text appearance adaptation network (TAANet). TLPNet first predicts the suitable regions for text embedding, after which TAANet adaptively adjusts the geometry and color of the text instance to match the background context. After training, those networks can be integrated and utilized to generate the synthetic dataset for scene text analysis tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed LBTS along with existing methods, and the experimental results indicate the proposed LBTS can generate better pretraining data for scene text detectors. Our dataset and code are made available at: https://github.com/iiclab/DecompST.  © 1992-2012 IEEE."
"This research paper conducts a comparative analysis on five distinct machine learning models employed for generating signature images using shared data and multiple evaluation metrics. The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of these models and identify their strengths and weaknesses. The assessment of the generated image quality is performed through various criteria including BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr. The results reveal that each model exhibits varying performance across different metrics, with no single model outperforming the others. However, certain models demonstrate higher scores on specific metrics, indicating their potential suitability for particular applications. The study emphasizes the importance of employing multiple evaluation metrics to accurately assess the quality of generated labels. It underscores the effectiveness of different machine learning models in this task. For instance, the CIDEr metric proves valuable when multiple tags are required for an image, as it considers tag diversity. Conversely, metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are more suitable for applications that prioritize clear and precise text by evaluating the clarity and overlap between generated and reference labels. This research underscores the significance of considering multiple evaluation methods to ensure the accurate assessment of label quality. The findings have practical implications for the development of efficient sign-making systems, providing guidance on the selection of appropriate models and measurements tailored to specific applications. © 2023 IEEE."
"This work presents a new framework for uncertainty quantification developed as a package in the Julia programming language called UncertaintyQuantification.jl. Julia is a modern high-level dynamic programming language ideally suited for tasks like data analysis and scientific computing. UncertaintyQuantification.jl was developed from the ground up to be generalized and flexible while at the same time being easy to use. Leveraging the features of a modern language such as Julia allows to write efficient, fast and easy to read code. Especially noteworthy is Julia’s core feature multiple dispatch which enables us to, for example, develop methods with a large number of varying simulation schemes such as standard Monte Carlo, Sobol sampling, Halton sampling, etc., yet minimal code duplication. Current features of UncertaintyQuantification.jl include simulation based reliability analysis using a large array of sampling schemes, local and global sensititivity analysis, meta modelling techniques such as response surface methodology or polynomial chaos expansion as well as the connection to external solvers by injecting values into plain text files as inputs. Through Julia’s existing distributed computing capabilities all available methods can be easily run on existing clusters with just a few lines of extra code. © 2023 UNCECOMP Proceedings.

"Non-timely reporting, selective reporting, or non-reporting of clinical trial results are prevalent and serious issues. WHO mandates that summary results be available in registries within 12 months of study completion and published in full text within 24 months. However, only a limited number of clinical trials in infectious diseases, including those done during the COVID-19 pandemic, have their results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of 50 trials of eight antiviral drugs tested against COVID-19 with a completion date of at least 2 years ago revealed that only 18% had their results published in the registry, with 40% not publishing any results. Non-timely and non-reporting practices undermine patient participation and are ethically unacceptable. Strategies should include obligatory reporting of summary results within 12 months in clinical trial registries, with progress towards peer-reviewed publication within 24 months indicated. Timely publication of research papers should be encouraged through an automated flagging mechanism in clinical trial registries that draws attention to the status of results reporting, such as a green tick for trials that have reported summary results within 12 months and a red tick in case of failure to do so. We propose the inclusion of mandatory clinical trial reporting standards in the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, which should prohibit sponsor contract clauses that restrict reporting (referred to as gag clauses) and require timely reporting of results as part of the ethics committees' clearance process for clinical trial protocols. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Sentiment analysis, the intricate task of discerning and classifying the myriad of sentiments conveyed within textual data, has captured substantial interest and intrigue, primarily driven by the pervasive utilization and influence of social media platforms. In this study, a novel approach to enhance sentiment analysis of Twitter data by employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism is proposed. The proposed model leverages the sequential nature of tweets and the attention mechanism to capture the inherent dependencies between words and highlight salient information. The RNN-based model on a large-scale dataset of annotated Twitter data, encompassing diverse sentiments is trained. The model effectively learns the contextual information and sentiment patterns, enabling accurate sentiment classification. A comprehensive set of tests were run to evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology, and the outcomes were meticulously compared to those of traditional machine learning algorithms and established deep learning models. The empirical findings demonstrate that proposed attention-based RNN model performs better than competing methods and achieves cutting-edge performance on sentiment analysis of Twitter data. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the attention weights generated by the model, shedding light on the significant words and phrases influencing sentiment classification is conducted. This provides valuable insights into the underlying sentiment dynamics in Twitter data. Proposed research contributes to the field of sentiment analysis by proposing an effective and robust approach for Twitter sentiment classification. The findings highlight the potential of RNNs with attention mechanisms in capturing the nuanced sentiment expressions prevalent in social media text. The proposed model can facilitate various applications, including real-time sentiment monitoring, brand reputation analysis, and public opinion tracking, benefiting industries and researchers alike. © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) individuals have an increased scope of healthcare needs and face many barriers to accessing healthcare. However, LGBTQ+ healthcare education remains scarce, and students’ understanding of LGBTQ+ healthcare remains largely uncharacterised. This study investigated the knowledge of and attitudes toward LGBTQ+ healthcare among medical students in Singapore and the United Kingdom (UK), two culturally different countries. Methods: Medical students in two medical schools, one in Singapore and the other in the UK, completed self-administered cross-sectional surveys using multiple-choice, Likert scale, and free-text questions to explore their ideas, concerns, and expectations about LGBTQ+ healthcare education within their medical curricula. Results: From 330 responses, students’ knowledge levels were moderate overall, with pronounced gaps in certain areas, including terminology, sexual health, and conversion therapy. Deficiencies in knowledge were significantly greater among students in Singapore compared to the UK (p < 0.001), whilst LGBTQ+ students and non-religious students had more positive knowledge and attitudes than students not identifying. At least 78% of students had positive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals, but 84% had not received LGBTQ+-specific medical education. Although junior UK students were more satisfied with the adequacy of teaching by their medical school’s incorporation of LGBTQ+ inclusive teaching in a newer curriculum, qualitative analyses suggested that students in both countries wanted to receive more training. Students further suggested improvements to the medical curriculum to meet their needs. Conclusion: Students in both schools lacked understanding of commonly-used terminology and topics such as sexual healthcare despite affirming attitudes towards LGBTQ+ healthcare. Although sociolegal contexts may affect students’ perspectives, differences were less than thought, and students were equally keen to provide affirmative care to their patients. They emphasised a need for more formal teaching of LGBTQ+ healthcare professions to overcome healthcare disparities in these communities.

"Purpose: This study aims to understand and a lay a foundation of how analytics has been used in depression management, this study conducts a systematic literature review using two techniques – text mining and manual review. The proposed methodology would aid researchers in identifying key concepts and research gaps, which in turn, will help them to establish the theoretical background supporting their empirical research objective. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores a hybrid methodology for literature review (HMLR), using text mining prior to systematic manual review. Findings: The proposed rapid methodology is an effective tool to automate and speed up the process required to identify key and emerging concepts and research gaps in any specific research domain while conducting a systematic literature review. It assists in populating a research knowledge graph that does not reach all semantic depths of the examined domain yet provides some science-specific structure. Originality/value: This study presents a new methodology for conducting a literature review for empirical research articles. This study has explored an “HMLR” that combines text mining and manual systematic literature review. Depending on the purpose of the research, these two techniques can be used in tandem to undertake a comprehensive literature review, by combining pieces of complex textual data together and revealing areas where research might be lacking. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Natural language processing techniques can be valuable for improving and facilitating historical research. This is also true for the analysis of petitions, a source which has been relatively little used in historical research. However, limited data resources pose challenges for mainstream natural language processing approaches based on machine learning. In this paper, we explore methods for automatically segmenting petitions according to their rhetorical structure. We find that the use of rules, word embeddings, and especially keywords can give promising results for this task. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"[Purpose/Significance] The new forms of employment have become an important support for China's economy. Improving laborers' digital literacy in the new forms of employment plays a key role in strengthening the development of China's digital economy.

"Introduction. The ease of searching and copying someone else’s text on almost any topic is one of the most important reasons for the prevalence of plagiarism in academic papers. While plagiarism detectors have become a common tool for universities, such systems are practically not used in secondary schools. It is considered to be a serious problem, that high school graduates are unprepared for the academic papers’ originality requirements. Universities are making efforts to overcome this lack of readiness. The authors study the attitude of teachers and learners of the Russian secondary schools toward the problem of plagiarism. Materials and Methods. An anonymous online survey of teachers (n = 2,286) and learners (m = 4,555) of secondary schools in the Vologda, Kaliningrad and Lipetsk regions of the Russian Federation was conducted. The survey was carried out through the Google Forms service. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the obtained data was carried out. Results. Learners acquire the habit of plagiarism already in secondary school. Secondary school learners are loyal to copying someone else’s text without reference to the source; although they partially admit that by doing so they do wrong. Teachers are less tolerant to this and ready to respond to plagiarism in learners’ papers by lowering marks/grades or by requiring learners to redo the work. Teachers do not always clearly understand which borrowings can be considered legitimate and correct, and which ones are not, they cannot explain this to their learners, cannot instill in them the necessary academic integrity, and cannot establish clear criteria for works evaluation.The use of plagiarism detection systems in schools is unsystematic and it is often the result of the initiative of individual teachers. There is also no methodology for using plagiarism detection systems in secondary schools. Discussion and Conclusion. The conducted studies for the first time provided actual confirmation of the hypotheses. It means that it is necessary to include plagiarism detection systems in the toolkit used in secondary school. We have obtained evidence, that it is necessary to implement such tools in the secondary education system step by step, as well as to create conditions, so that school teachers can acquire relevant skills. The materials of the article will be useful to scientists who study the problems of secondary and high education, managers of the secondary education system at all levels, teachers, lecturers and learners of pedagogical universities. © 2023 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

"The theme of organizational ethics has seen growing interest from scholars and practitioners in recent years. Ethics plays an important role in business because they influence decisions, behaviors, and outcomes at multiple levels of analysis (Majluf and Navarrete in J Bus Ethics 100:567–579, 2011). The vast majority of papers on ethical business have been done in western countries. However, little research has analyzed organizational ethics from an Islamic perspective. Our paper fits into this framework. Our objective is to study how Islamic values influence organizational ethics. In order to answer our problematic, we established a Systematic Literature Review. First, data were collected from three academic databases. The data collected contained 441 documents. In order to select and assess articles, we used a protocol-based review technique called Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). These guidelines present the process of identification, selection (inclusion/exclusion), and assessment of relevant studies. For this, we used Zotero software. Therefore, 54 full-text articles were available for final review. Two types of analyzes were carried out through NVivo software: quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis was performed in order to have a general vision concerning the publications on Islam and Ethical Organization included in this study and their contents. Thus, we have realized a descriptive analysis of the data and a word cloud analysis. However, the qualitative analysis of the database was conducted through thematic analysis, with the aim to identify the main themes related to Islamic values and organizational ethics. After three cycles of coding, we extracted four themes: (1) Islamic Business Ethics; (2) Islamic Ethical Climate. (3) Islam-based-CSR; and (4) Islamic Financial Institution (IFI). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"The classical aspect-based sentiment classification combined with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and attention mechanism is weak and cannot fully capture long-distance dependencies. These methods only focus on the relative position and ignore sentence order features during sentiment classification. This paper proposed a Gated Convolutional Neural Network denoted as GTRU gating model PosATT-GTRU with improved position attention to achieve aspect-based sentiment classification. First, combine the Laplacian kernel function to define the location information matrix to obtain location features and word order features. Then, filters of different sizes are then used to semantically encode the text position and content. Finally, PosATT-GTRU is used to control the information flow of semantic features, location features, and aspect words while capturing the long-distance dependence of the text. The experimental results on the SemEval2014 data set show that model accuracy has been significantly improved compared with previous models. © 2023 IEEE."

"The study aimed to examine the rhetorical and linguistic devices employed in one of Hanan Ashrawi’s speeches to support the Palestinian cause and promote her perspective. Based on the Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) framework, this paper identified and analysed the thematic patterns in her speech qualitatively within the semiotic dimensions of text analysis, including contextual, semantic, and lexico-grammar features. The findings demonstrate the significance of rhetorical and linguistic devices in advocacy language, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The use of metaphors, repetition, parallelism, and nominalization is found to be particularly effective in enhancing the persuasiveness of advocacy language. Additionally, the findings reveal a clear connection between the thematic patterns identified in the speech and the dominant types of processes used, such as the Material process in discussing U.S. policy towards Israel and Palestine and the Mental process in discussing hope and resilience amidst the oppression and injustice practiced against the Palestinians. © 2023 The Author(s).

"In order to clarify the extent to which private express delivery enterprises fulfill their social responsibilities, help the government supervise their social responsibilities and promote the high-quality development of Chinese express delivery enterprises, this paper obtains annual reports and corporate social responsibility reports issued by Chinese private express delivery enterprises over the years from relevant channels such as Juchao Information Network, Orient Fortune Network, and the company's official website, and applies the grounded theory analysis method. QSR Nvivo 12.0 software is used to carry out open coding, spindle coding and selective coding of the original data, and summarizes and extracts six core categories of social responsibility of private express enterprises, namely, employee responsibility, management responsibility, economic responsibility, customer responsibility, environmental responsibility and charity responsibility. And further construct the structure dimension and core content system of private express corporate social responsibility. This study theoretically clarifies the structural dimension of the social responsibility of private express delivery enterprises, which not only provides a reference for private express delivery enterprises to fulfill their social responsibilities, but also makes a contribution to the government's supervision of enterprises to fulfill their social responsibilities. © 2023 IEEE."
"International prevalence rates for gaming disorder range with approximately 3.05% of individuals meeting criteria. Despite the high potential for diagnosis, most clinicians in health care facilities who treat known comorbidities (e.g., anxiety or depression) do not assess clients at intake for gaming disorder. The present study aims to evaluate the Brief Internet Gaming Screen–8 (BIGS-8) as a self-assessment screening tool within a health care setting treating clients with comorbid disorders. The measure was administered to individuals in a U.S. treatment facility that specializes in treating gaming disorder and technology overuse (n = 128). The participant’s ages were 13–35. The majority (87.9%) of individual’s primary presenting behavior for which they sought treatment was due to impairment in psychosocial functioning associated with video gaming. To discover the factor structure of the BIGS-8, a parallel analysis scree plot and an exploratory factor analysis were conducted using half of the sample chosen at random (n = 64). A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the other randomly chosen half of participants (n = 64). Results indicated a one-factor solution. To explore convergent validity, the sum score of the BIGS-8 was significantly positively correlated with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale–21 (DASS-21) Depression subscale and DASS-21 Anxiety subscale sum scores. Within a components-based addiction framework aligned with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition–Text Revision criteria, the BIGS-8 yielded an acceptable model fit. The BIGS-8 poses clinical utility of identifying behavioral addiction elements that align with common comorbidities within a clinical sample and may be useful as a preliminary screening tool prior to completing a more comprehensive clinical assessment. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"The popularity of creating artificial intelligence models has been incredibly rising. These tools can be used in many different areas, including text analysis. Most modern models offer great accuracy in many different text-based tasks but are limited by a huge number of data required to not only pre-train but also fine-tune these models. This problem only deepens in models trained on data from low and mid-resource languages, such as Slovak. In this paper, we examined the fine-tuning process of such models and tried to enhance it by connecting to Epinet to create Epistemic neural network, a relatively new concept that helps the model to detect its own uncertainty to make better decisions in the long run. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Motivated by a public suggestion by the famous novelist Kurt Vonnegut, we clustered functional data that represented sentiment curves for famous fictional stories. We analyzed text data from novels written between 1612 and 1925, and transformed them into curves measuring sentiment as a function of the percentage of elapsed contents of the novel. We employed sentence-level sentiment evaluation and nonparametric curve smoothing. Our clustering methods involved finding the optimal number of clusters, aligning curves using different chronological warping functions to account for phase and amplitude variation, and implementing functional K-means algorithms under the square root velocity framework. Our results revealed insights about patterns in fictional narratives that Vonnegut and others have suggested but not analyzed in a functional way. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"The article discusses the plot, designated in the catalog of fairy tale types as “Borma Yaryzhka” (AaTh 485A): the hero is sent to the overseas kingdom, which is overrun by serpents, to obtain the royal regalia (~ to the city of Babylon for the crown); he fulfills his mission and returns; having three adventures on the way back (blinding the one-eyed ogre; escaping the sexual captivity of the ‘forest woman’; helping the lion in his fight with the enemy and then showing him the ‘power of hops’). It focuses on the literary sources of the plot frame (such as The Tale of the Babylonian Kingdom, The Parable of the City of Babylon, the Legend of Leo the Philosopher by Archbishop Anthony) and their origin; analyses the description of the hero’s adventures on his way back home and their genesis; discusses how this source material was assembled into a stable composition of an adventure tale. The conducted research leads us to the conclusion that The Tale of the Babylonian Kingdom is a Russian reworking of a Byzantine oral legend which over time absorbed a number of ‘wandering’ literary subplots. Their montage (unlikely to happen in the oral tradition) was probably modeled on the compositional patterns typical for books about the misadventures of returning heroes. Stories circulating in the tradition, which corresponded to a similar theme, provided the necessary materials. Thus, a long adventure story was created and later adapted by oral tradition. Analysis of its folkloric versions points to the previous existence of manuscript texts now lost, but their content can be partially restored from the available oral archives. Moreover, certain correspondences between the Russian adventure tale and the ones that come from geographically, historically and culturally distant parts (Latin, Arabic, Chinese), show that in the past there were some ‘intermediate links’ which connected them. Consequently, it is possible to hypothesize the existence of rich currents of manuscript texts, remotely connecting the whole ‘reader space’ of Eurasia and North Africa. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Extraneous neuroscience information improves ratings of scientific explanations, and affects mock juror decisions in many studies, but others have yielded little to no effect. To establish the magnitude of this effect, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis using 60 experiments from 28 publications. We found a mild but highly significant effect, with substantial heterogeneity. Planned subgroup analyses revealed that within-subjects studies, where people can compare the same material with and without neuroscience, and those using text, have stronger effects than between-subjects designs, and studies using brain image stimuli. We serendipitously found that effect sizes were stronger on outcomes of evaluating satisfaction or metacomprehension, compared with jury verdicts or assessments of convincingness. In conclusion, there is more than one type of neuroscience explanations effect. Irrelevant neuroscience does have a seductive allure, especially on self-appraised satisfaction and understanding, and when presented as text. © The Author(s) 2023."

"The article presents the results of the analysis of errors occurring in the transcription of the Russian language into the Polish alphabet in the Polish Internet posts. Spelling mistakes were identified in the group of words transcribed from Russian texts extracted from archived websites. The authors distinguish types of errors, such as replaced characters, omitted characters and inserted characters. They discuss the reasons for the errors’ occurrence and compare the obtained results with the previous research. The analysis proves that a significant number of spelling mistakes are caused by the attempt to approximate the sounds of the Russian language, while some errors result from the interference of the Polish language and the lack of knowledge of Russian. © 2023, Society of Friends of the Polish Language.

"A well-known and frequently used machine learning method, the Naive Bayes algorithm has attracted a lot of interest in a number of fields. The Naive Bayes algorithm, along with its benefits, drawbacks, and practical applications, will be covering in this survey study. The Naive Bayes algorithm's fundamentals are first studied in the survey, with special attention paid to how heavily it relies on probability theory and the notion of feature independence. The Naive Bayes method is further examined, as well as its applicability to both continuous and discrete data. The study then looks into the benefits of the Naive Bayes method, emphasizing its tolerance to irrelevant characteristics, great computing efficiency, and capacity for handling high- dimensional data. The algorithm's interpretability and ability to work with different application domains are also highlighted. The survey article looks at various restrictions, such as the feature independence assumption and algorithm's sensitivity to missing data and its incapacity to recognize intricate correlations between variables. The survey article offers a variety of real-world situations where the Naive Bayes algorithm has been effectively used in order to give a thorough viewpoint. Text categorization, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, recommender systems, medical diagnosis, and financial fraud detection are some of these uses. This survey article provides academics, practitioners, and enthusiasts with an invaluable resource for comprehending the Naive Bayes algorithm's capabilities and concerns by compiling the algorithm's benefits, drawbacks, and applications. It serves as a starting point for further investigation and the creation of enhanced versions and modifications of the Naive Bayes algorithm. © 2023 IEEE."
"Takis Würger's novel Stella, published in 2019, has received mostly unenthusiastic reviews from literary critics because, in their opinion, it does not do justice to Stella Goldschlag's historical persona. Rather, the text merely turns a tragic conflict into Holocaust kitsch. In order to examine this judgement, the article analyses the poetics of the novel. This analysis reveals two things: the text does not in fact strive for a historically accurate portrayal of Stella Goldschlag, but reflects on the different ways of accessing the historical phenomenon. In this sense, Stella may be seen as an passable attempt to write modern literature about the Holocaust for today's generation. It does not, however, do so consistently because it oscillates between the genre of the historical novel and allegory. The fictitious narrator, Friedrich, also proves inconsistent. His mixture of naivety and pathos indeed tends towards kitsch. © 2023 POZNAŃSKIE STUDIA SLAWISTYCZNE. All rights reserved."
"This article is devoted to the role of royal counselors and nobles in Hincmar of Reims’s political concept. The study is based on political instructions of the prelate of Reims, such as “De regis persona et regio ministerio” and “De ordine palatii”, as well as the letters of the archbishop and his compilation of the Annals of St Bertin. Analysis of Hincmar’s texts shows that royal power was based on harmony between the king, the nobility, and the clergy. Drawing attention to contemporary events, the prelate of Reims criticizes both representatives of the nobility in the Kingdom of the West Franks, and the kings who indulge them. In Hincmar’s opinion, the only way for a king to rule virtuously and rightfully is to rely on the advice of just and wise counselors. The virtues of the royal inner circle are the same as the virtues of the king: justice, mercy, wisdom, piety, humility. The Reims prelate envisions a bishop as the ideal royal advisor. Moreover, since the priest is responsible to the Lord for the king’s deeds, he must strictly observe the fulfilment of king’s duties. In this regard, Hincmar constructs the office of an apocrisiarius-archcapellan, an envoy from the Frankish episcopate, who would supervise all church affairs at court and guide the king’s ethics as well. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Using Charlotte, North Carolina as a case study, we compare the housing and neighborhood choices of out-of-town movers compared to locals. Out-of-town movers, defined as those relocating from more than 200 miles, prompt our analysis of whether external population pressures were distributed evenly throughout the city. We leverage a unique combination of data sources, including neighborhood ”quality of life” indicators from a web-based dashboard and property advertisement text from the Multiple Listing Service. Our findings highlight distinct characteristics of homes and neighborhoods with a higher proportion of out-of-town movers: excellent public schools, single-family homes with upscale kitchens, and fitness amenities. Neighborhoods have a population of highly educated, White residents. In contrast, neighborhoods that are more pedestrian-friendly, bicycle-accessible, or close to public transit and require property renovations tend to attract fewer out-of-town movers.

"The article is devoted to the description of the operation of the hybrid intelligent information system for analysis of judicial practice of arbitration courts. The structure of a generalized abstract of a judicial act is considered. The essential factor is that lawyers perceive a verbatim quote much better, whether it be a sentence or a whole paragraph, than a generated text; in the latter case, they have no confidence that the essence is reflected correctly. Existing solutions to the problem of abstract generation of a judicial act are briefly reviewed. The proposed solution is based on the hybrid intelligent information system for analysis of judicial practice of arbitration courts. The main elements of the system are the subsystem of subconsciousness (SbS) and the subsystem of consciousness (SbC). The role of the environment is performed by the texts of judicial acts that can be submitted to the system. Depending on the number of input documents, a judicial act (one document) and judicial practice (several documents) can be distinguished. The subsystem of subconsciousness includes the following modules: the preprocessing module, the feature extraction module, the module of clustering and grouping of judicial acts, the paragraph classification module. The subsystem of consciousness includes the following modules: the module for compiling a summary of a judicial act, the judicial practice analysis module, the report generation module. The results of the experiments are described in the corresponding section. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This paper analyses citations of doctrine in handbooks of administrative law published in the nineteenth century in the Civil Law World–that is, Europe and Latin America. I scanned through 81 books, finding c 25,000 citations to c 5000 different texts. I built a graph with all citations to find relations of proximity and distance between different books and national groups of books. I found that French lawyers were the most cited, but they lost ground in the late nineteenth century. ‘Germans’ and, to a less extent, ‘Italians’ gained ground. Germans and Austrians constituted a mostly separated citation circuit. Spanish and Hispano Americans tended to cite Spanish and French authors but were less integrated. Italians mixed a large number of Italian references with French ones. Brazilians and Portuguese heavily cited the French. Latin Americans did not constitute a unified group. Mediterranean countries shared more characteristics and references with Latin Americans than with Germans and the Dutch. These findings challenge essentialist ideas of ‘continental law’ and ‘Latin America’. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Background: Pharmacists are increasingly incorporated into general practice teams globally and have been shown to positively impact patient outcomes. However, little research to date has focused on determining general practitioners’ (GPs’) perceptions of practice-based pharmacist roles in countries yet to establish such roles. Objectives: To explore GPs’ perceptions towards integrating pharmacists into practices and determine if any significant associations were present between GPs’ perceptions and their demographic characteristics. Methods: In June 2022, a survey was disseminated to GPs in Ireland via post (n = 500 in Munster region), Twitter, WhatsApp, and an online GP support and education network. Quantitative data were captured through multiple option and Likert-scale questions and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were captured via free-text boxes, with the open comments analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: A total of 152 valid responses were received (24.6% response to postal survey). Overall, GPs welcomed the role of practice-based pharmacists and perceived that they would increase patient safety. Most agreed with practice pharmacists providing medicine information (98%) vs. 23% agreeing with practice pharmacists prescribing independently. Most agreed they would partake in a practice pharmacist pilot (78.6%). The free-text comments described current pressures in general practice, existing relationships with pharmacists, funding and governance strategies, potential roles for pharmacists in general practice, and anticipated outcomes of such roles. Conclusion: This study provides a deeper understanding of GPs’ perceptions of integrating pharmacists into practices and the demographic characteristics associated with different perceptions, which may help better inform future initiatives to integrate pharmacists into practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

"With the increasing popularity of South Korea as a tourist destination owing to Hallyu (Korean wave), the hotels have experienced a surge in the number of foreign guests. Although COVID-19 halted the tourism industry for a while, the recent lifting of travel bans and restrictions has opened the doors for the tourism industry to flourish again. However, the study regarding the accommodation experiences of Foreign Guests in South Korea is limited. To bridge this gap, this study explores the accommodation attributes important to English Speaking Tourists. It also makes various suggestions in the line of targeted marketing including hotel-country groups and the distribution of topics (service attributes) across the countries. A total of 50,175 online English reviews from hotels based in Seoul listed on TripAdvisor were analyzed for customers' sentiments regarding the accommodation experiences through Text Mining techniques. Findings revealed that the hotels in 'Myeongdong' and 'Gangnam' had more positive reviews than others. Managers should focus on overcoming language barriers and providing friendly services. The study also highlighted that providing transportation service to the Airport is one of the important dimensions to improve guest satisfaction. Further, all reviews were modeled using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to investigate the important aspects that need improvement followed by detailed analysis. This analysis is valuable for hotel managers to improve the satisfaction of the guests by studying the common extracted topics and unique dimensions and thus better understanding the customer's accommodation needs which in turn will help in improving their competitiveness in the industry by developing better marketing strategies. © 2023 IEEE."
"Over the continued course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant volume of expert-written diagnosis reports has been accumulated that capture a multitude of symptoms and observations on diagnosed COVID-19 cases, along with expert-validated chest X-ray scans. The utility of rich, latent information embedded in such unstructured expert-written diagnosis reports and its importance as a source of valuable disease-specific information has been explored to a very limited extent. In this work, a convolutional attention-based dense (CAD) neural model for COVID-19 prediction is proposed. The model is trained on the rich disease-specific parameters extracted from chest X-ray images and expert-written diagnostic text reports to support an evidence-based diagnosis. Scalability is ensured by incorporating content based learning models for automatically generating diagnosis reports of identified COVID-19 cases, reducing radiologists' cognitive burden. Experimental evaluation showed that multimodal patient data plays a vital role in diagnosing early-stage cases, thus helping hasten the diagnosis process. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"Intent of the paper is to investigate a comparison of different multi-classification models using machine learning and deep learning methodologies to categorize the sentiment of sentences from the rotten tomato’s movie review dataset. In order to achieve best performance three machine learning and three deep learning algorithms were estimated: logistic regression, linear support vector classifier, and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)/LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and CNN + Gated Recurrent unit network (GRU). In this work, it is observed that linear support vector classifier shows significant improvement among all other machine learning algorithms. Moreover, when deep leaning algorithms were included in the model, one of the deep leaning algorithms, CNN provides highest accuracy of 80% among all the algorithms. After optimizing the fitted model, new text data are considered for testing of correct predictive model and prediction of new text data. Optimized predicted model, i.e., CNN seems to give correct predictions for new test data. Hence, CNN model supposed to be used as one of the most suitable models for sentiment analysis of Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews since there is improvement of multi-class classification accuracy. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2023."
"The abstract focuses on the prevalence of cyber bullying among young individuals on social media platforms. As the popularity of these platforms continues to grow, the prevalence of cyber bullying incidents is also increasing. The aim is to leverage Deep learning methods and create a DL model capable of automatically identifying social media bullying through the analysis of word similarities within tweets. To find word similarities in the tweets that were transcribed by bullies, use deep learning, to create a deep learning model that can mechanically detect bullying acts on social media. The purpose of the work is to demonstrate the creation of software which can recognize harassed tweets, posts, and other forms of online communication. It has been recommended for practice a model constructed on deep learning to find bullying on Twitter. CNN is preferred to understand the significance of text and to group it appropriately, whilst NLP is developed for the purpose of processing the records. Moreover, the Twitter API is utilized in order to get tweets, and then those tweets are fed into a model which concludes whether or not they establish bullying. © 2023 IEEE."

"[Purpose/Significance] Urban library is the basic unit of public cultural space governance, and its role orientation guides the action direction of the new library construction, renovation (expansion) of space and the socialized expression of its space value [Design/ Methodology] Using the methods of qualitative text analysis, deduction and induction, literature and network survey, this paper examines the role orientation of urban libraries in the public cultural space from the three dimensions of policy arrangement, practical needs and public expectation. [Findings/Conclusion] The national cultural governance policy points to the shift of urban libraries from ""participants"" to ""leaders"", from ""user center"" to ""social intervention"", and from ""people center"" to ""high-quality development"". The industry practice requires urban libraries to become the constructors of the city's public ""justice space"", the cultivators of ""resilience space"" and the providers of ""development space"". The public expects the urban libraries to provide emotional healing, ubiquitous interconnection and inclusive public cultural space. In order to fully participate in the construction of public cultural space, urban libraries should refine the spatial value integration system through brand building, improve the spatial collaborative governance framework through mechanism innovation, and reshape the spatial cultural scene through integration of digital and real scene.

"In recent years, there has been considerable growth in the volume of legal proceedings in Brazil. In this context, there is a lot of potential in using recent advances in Natural Language Processing to automate tasks and analysis in the legal domain. In this article, we investigate text decoding methods for automating the writing of keyphrases, a sequence of key terms present in documents used in courts throughout Brazil. For this purpose, a text-to-text framework based on generative Transformers is used to generate keyphrases and evaluate three decoding techniques: greedy, top-K, and top-p. Since the keyphrases are designed to improve retrieval tasks, we evaluated keyphrases generated by the decoding methods in legal document retrieval. Traditional retrieval methods (TF-IDF and BM25) were used to evaluate the quality of the generated keyphrases. The results obtained (in terms of IR metrics) were statistically significant, and they indicate that greedy decoding generates high-quality keyphrases for the dockets used in this work, providing keyphrases close to the ones generated by human specialists. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The paper attempted to analyze the character of Boochani in his memoir No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison, in the light of Abraham Maslow’s Theory of Hierarchical Needs. Boochani wrote his novel while he was still locked in the Manus Island detention center. It narrates the story of a man who followed his dream to reach his dreamland. The study was carried out using a descriptive qualitative research methodology through textual analysis design. Since the study was text-based, a meticulous reading process of the text was done. We used the text as the primary source for data collection. Therefore, a portion of the sentences, paragraphs, and phrases related to the study’s objective were taken as examples and excerpts and analyzed using Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. The results revealed that Boochani, like all humans, was driven by physiological and psychological needs, ranging from the most fundamental to the most extreme. His journey aimed to get self-actualization but never could get it and hardly fulfilled other basic needs completely. Boochani’s voyage is depicted as a series of rising and falling waves. He occasionally satisfies some needs, but he never succeeds in meeting the need for self-actualization and self-esteem. And hardly does he fulfill the other three levels of the hierarchy of needs. His entire story serves as a metaphor for everyone who strives for self-actualization yet encounters obstacles. © 2023, Syiah Kuala University. All rights reserved."
"Purpose: This research aims to study the essence and peculiarities of STEM education and identify the critical elements of embedding this mechanism in the learning process in the world and Azerbaijan. Research Methods: Study of literature and other sources of information; text analysis; formulation of conclusions. Results: The STEM education movement is clearly impacting the international scene. However, serious doubts persist about its foundations, nature, and implementation, which should make us reflect on the danger that it may become an innovation that can be diluted. Here we have: (1) characterized those models of STEM education proposed by educational research; (2) provided a valid STEM education model based on a valid model of STEM education that is supported by the research. Contribution to literature: The study contributes to the current research literature by systematizing the existing evidence and grouping the reasons for the importance of STEM education according to specific indicators and criteria. The study also presents a set of practical recommendations to all interested educational institutions on how to organize the process of STEM education for its effectiveness, taking into account all previous mistakes made by the world experience. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd.

"(Figure presented.) Copyright © 2023 Tsironis, Karagkouni, Dimitriou and Tsagarakis.; Sustainability has been a topic of growing interest over the past years with many governments, organizations, and companies trying to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The major challenge of implementing more sustainable practices within the corporate environments is still in the foreground, probably even in higher demand, due to the intense environmental degradation and the strict deadlines related to the decarbonization and shift towards greener production systems. Indicatively, the European Commission suggests that transport currently accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s (EU) greenhouse gas emissions and this figure continues to rise as demand grows. In this work, we investigate the transportation sector, distribution systems, and supply chain through the prism of sustainability by mining and analyzing open-access data on the LinkedIn social media platform, which is widely used for professional networking, especially, in the European market. Thus, we extract valuable insights into the current trends around sustainability within the transportation sector. More precisely, 1,638 LinkedIn profiles registered as “companies” related to transportation have been data mined providing valuable outputs regarding their sustainability-oriented activities. Our dataset contains companies with a staff range of over 200 employees, aiming to gain insights from medium SMEs and large organizations. Key findings of our analysis include the differentiation of application areas regarding sustainable concepts and the rise of the percentage of sustainability-related companies with the company staff size combined with a rather strong connection between the United Kingdom’s and United States’s transportation sectors.

"[Purpose/Significance] The breakthrough of Generative Artificial Intelligence（Generative AI）has led to the explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content （AIGC）, which inevitably cause people to be negatively affected by information overload, information noise, information security, and other related issues, making social information governance face new challenges. This paper aims to analyze and discuss the characteristic attributes of AIGC incidents, so as to provide a reference for Generative AI governance in China. [Design/Methodology] Based on AI Incident Database（AIID）and taking AIGC-related incident reports as samples for content analysis, the types, causes, damage objects and countermeasures of existing AIGC incidents were discussed. [Findings/Conclusion] The diversity of the objects affected by AIGC incidents, the wide distribution of the scope, and the complex unknown of the potential harm, result in the resources and capabilities of any single actor not being able to effectively deal with the crisis. It is necessary for actors of government, enterprises and society to form a governance participation model of ""diversity + coordination + checks and balances"", and to carry out information governance under the action framework of ""context-consciousness-action"". [Originality/Value] This paper introduces AIID as a case source database, provides an intuitive demonstration of the relevant details of existing AIGC incidents and forms a three-level category framework for AIGC incident analysis through content analysis.The action frame of Generative AI governance formed in this study is helpful to promote the exploration and practice of Generative AI governance from a macro perspective. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"This study evaluates 22 lexical complexity measures that represent the three constructs of density, diversity and sophistication. The selection of these measures stems from an extensive review of the SLA linguistics literature. All measures were subjected to qualitative screening for indicators/predictors of lexical proficiency/development and criterion validity based on the body of scholarship. This study’s measure-testing process begins by dividing the selected measures into two groups, similarly calculated and dissimilarly calculated, based on their quantification methods and the results of correlation tests. Using a specialized corpus of postgraduate academic texts, a Structural Factor Analysis (SFA) comprising a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is then conducted. The purpose of SFA is to 1) verify and examine the lexical classifications proposed in the literature, 2) evaluate the relationship between various lexical constructs and their representative measures, 3) identify the indices that best represent each construct and 4) detect possible new structures/dimensions. Based on the analysis of the corpus, the study discusses the construct-distinctiveness of lexical complexity constructs, as well as strong indicators of each conceptual/mathematical group among the measures. Finally, a unique and smaller set of measures representative of each construct is suggested for future studies that require measure selection. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Correlative analysisfor identification of body organ malfunction is a complex multidomain task, that involves collection and processing of correlative parameters for different organs. To perform this task, design of an efficient deep learning model for analyzing the effect of variations in Electrocardiograms (ECG) and Electroencephalograms (EEG) disturbances on kidney, lungs, and liver functions is discussed in this text. The proposed model integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Autoencoders and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for feature extraction and pattern recognition operations. The efficacy of the model is further enhanced by incorporating Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for accurate prediction of the impact of ECG and EEG disturbances on functioning of different organs. The proposed deep learning model provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of ECG and EEG disturbances on vital organ functions. The integration of GANs with Autoencoders and LSTM-based RNNs enables efficient feature extraction and pattern recognition, leading to improved accuracy in predicting the effect of disturbances on organ functions. The VARMA GRU further enhances the accuracy of the model by capturing the complex interdependencies between the vital organs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The article analyzes the visual representations on the armed conflict that privileged the newspapers El Tiempo and El Espectador during the period 2008-2016, as well as the relationships of these with the configuration of certain regimes of the gaze in the deployment of memories of the recent past in Colombia. For this purpose, a visual analysis methodology was employed that addressed the pre-iconographic, preiconographic and iconological levels of the selected corpus of photographs, in their relations with the alphabetical texts that accompany them. In the end, once the extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances were identified as predominant topics of the period, three types of representations were evidenced: the ambivalence between the shock and the routinization of horror; the adaptation of the gaze towards suffering as an anamnestic strategy of the establishment; and an iconographic turn towards the indexical and metonymic that contributes to the distribution of the sensitive, which contrasts with positions of apparent neutrality on the part of the examined newspapers. © 2023 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

"The integrity and security of medical data have become a big challenge for healthcare services applications. Images of hidden text represent steganography forms in which the image is exploited as an object to cover information and data. So, the data masking ability and image quality of the cover object are significant elements in image masking. In this study, the patient’s personal information and message generated by the doctor’s comment are stored in the images. Image pixels and message bits are exchanged sequentially. The best cluster is randomly selected using the genetic algorithm (GA) and standard deviation (STD) methods. The method, depending on optimizing and taking benefits of the similarities between pixels, has been proposed. High image quality can be achieved by using stego-image and increasing the data amount to be hidden. Analysis metrics of visual quality such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and bit error rate (BER) are adopted to assess the performance of the method proposed. The suggested and proposed model has proven its capability to mask the secrete data of patients into a cover image transmitted with high ability, imperceptibility, and minimal future degradation. © This is an open access article under the CC BY-SA license."
"The paper discusses a segment of modern social and political German communication which can be defined as vaccine discourse. The study considers discourse to be a complex linguistic unit of an overtext level, which includes texts, utterances, and various communication forms that are encompassed by a knowledge system and correspond to a certain social context. In creating the context of a speech act, all its participants are involved. Special role is also devoted not only to the interaction of utterances but also to the social context they are used in. Combined, these factors create a multidimensional discourse space. Discourse, being the result of chains of utterances united by the topic, constitutes the surrounding reality. We studied the formation of the reality with the means of discourse on the materials of the vaccine discourse, with its development being based on different opinions. We analyzed linguistic features of the German vaccine discourse using discussions and debates in the Bundestag, which took place in spring 2022. We detected major features of the vaccine discourse: polarization, diversity, and incompleteness. The examples prove argumentation to be central in forming the discourse, as it is used by the individuals when seeking the truth. We defined the most important argument strategies and characterized linguistic means responsible for the emotionally polarizing part of the discourse. We detected the relationship of different discourse levels having analyzed discourse contextualization. Moreover, we demonstrated how the microlevel of discourse, which is associated with vaccination, creates impulses for its development to the macrolevel reflecting German democratic challenges. © 2023 Vestnik Sankt-Peterburgskogo Universiteta, Yazyk i Literatura.

"Introduction: Contemporary efforts to predict surgical outcomes focus on the associations between traditional discrete surgical risk factors. We aimed to determine whether natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured operative notes improves the prediction of residual disease in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) following cytoreductive surgery. Methods: Electronic Health Records were queried to identify women with advanced EOC including their operative notes. The Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) score was used to quantify the discrimination capacity of sequences of words (n-grams) regarding the existence of residual disease. We employed the state-of-the-art RoBERTa-based classifier to process unstructured surgical notes. Discrimination was measured using standard performance metrics. An XGBoost model was then trained on the same dataset using both discrete and engineered clinical features along with the probabilities outputted by the RoBERTa classifier. Results: The cohort consisted of 555 cases of EOC cytoreduction performed by eight surgeons between January 2014 and December 2019. Discrete word clouds weighted by n-gram TF-IDF score difference between R0 and non-R0 resection were identified. The words ‘adherent’ and ‘miliary disease’ best discriminated between the two groups. The RoBERTa model reached high evaluation metrics (AUROC.86; AUPRC.87, precision, recall, and F1 score of.77 and accuracy of.81). Equally, it outperformed models that used discrete clinical and engineered features and outplayed the performance of other state-of-the-art NLP tools. When the probabilities from the RoBERTa classifier were combined with commonly used predictors in the XGBoost model, a marginal improvement in the overall model’s performance was observed (AUROC and AUPRC of.91, with all other metrics the same). Conclusion/Implications: We applied a sui generis approach to extract information from the abundant textual surgical data and demonstrated how it can be effectively used for classification prediction, outperforming models relying on conventional structured data. State-of-art NLP applications in biomedical texts can improve modern EOC care. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The paper reveals the results of studying the genealogy and the chain of spiritual succession of Sufi sheikhs who lived in the 18th–19th centuries in the mountainous Lezgi village of Khlyut, South Dagestan. A Sufi monastery, known as “Tekke”, was located there. The founder of the monastery was Sheikh Muhammad-‘Ali, who is believed to be of Yemen origin. We present the text and annotated translation of an early list of a valuable historical source in Arabic for the first time. The list has been found to be compiled approximately in the middle of the 18th century, which makes it the earliest surviving document of this kind in Dagestan. It includes both the spiritual genealogy (silsila) and the lineage (nasab) of the Khlyut sheikhs. The author managed to almost completely restore the content of the main text of the document, which became possible due to the presence of two handwritten lists. We conclude that the main text of the late list, with the exception of a small interpolated insert, was carried over from the early list. Both lists end with small late additions with information about two branches of the sheikhs’ descendants. An analysis of the genealogy of Khlyut spiritual figures shows that they were descendants of Sufi sheikhs who lived in northern Shirvan. Silsila contains the names of the most famous medieval Sufis of the Muslim world and goes back to the Yemeni Tabi‘in Uwais alQarani, and through him to ‘Ali b. Abi Talib. The mention in the silsila of famous Shirvan sheikhs of the 15th century of the Khalwatiyya order, as well as their successors, who lived in the mountains of southern Dagestan, leaves no doubt that the Khlyut sheikhs also belonged to this Sufi brotherhood. It has been established that the vigorous activity of Khalwatiyya in South Dagestan was not limited only to the Late Middle Ages, but continued later. The Arabic-language inscriptions of the Tekke complex, on the territory of which the burial places of Sufis, the remains of residential buildings and premises for Sufi practices are located, have also been studied. © Z.Sh.

"Industrial plant operators have so far relied mainly on the wisdom and experience of experts to make effective use of huge amounts of text information such as accident cases and near-miss reports. However, the aging and retirement of experienced skilled workers has made continued effective use into a common issue for industrial plant operators. The present study created prototypes of two analysis methods, analysis based on words (text mining＋Bayesian network) and analysis based on technical data (ontology) as possible solutions to this problem. In the future, we plan to systematize the created prototype for use in the cloud, and to build a “safety information platform” equipped with a “safety information database” and “analysis software.” In addition, we will also continue to improve the operation/management method after the system is launched for connection to a system that allows continuous operation. © 2023 Japan Petroleum Institute.

"Objectives: To evaluate whether the restorative material in direct contact with the dentin influences pulp vitality in primary and permanent teeth with deep carious lesions restored after selective caries removal (SCR). Material and methods: Systematic searches of databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Science were performed for primary and permanent teeth. Inclusion criteria were applied for title and abstract reading of databases search results. After full texts review of included studies, those that did not meet exclusion criteria were excluded from meta-analysis. Results: For meta-analysis, 2 studies were included for permanent teeth and 6 for primary teeth. The failure events reported were meta-analyzed using two statistical methods: standard pairwise meta-analysis (SPMA) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The SPMA identified similar failure occurrence of restorations performed with calcium hydroxide (CH) and other liner materials (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41, 1.74; p = 0.64), no significant difference between the use of alternative liners or CH regardless deciduous or permanent teeth (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.36, 1.71; p = 0.55) and similar risk of failing at different follow-ups for all liner materials tested (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.35, 1.70; p = 0.52). Probabilistic analysis indicated GIC as liner material with the highest probability of clinical success (SUCRA = 72.76%), and CH ranked as the worst liner material (SUCRA = 21.81%).

"In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to measure document similarity using bidirectional encoder representations (BERTs) from transformers and its implementation as an application programming interface (API). BERT has recently shown significant improvements in natural language processing and is widely used in various applications such as question answering and text classification. We trained and refined a BERT model on a large corpus of documents to measure document similarity. The proposed API receives two text arguments and returns the degree of similarity between them. On several benchmark datasets, we demonstrated that our approach outperforms conventional state-of-the-art similarity measures. Our experimental results show that the proposed method of measuring document similarity using BERT and API is effective and efficient, and that API implementations can be used in a variety of real-world scenarios is visible. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Artificial simulations such as agent-based models provide an environment in which to explore the dynamics of human behavior, and can contribute to the work of genocide researchers seeking to understand and prevent this atrocity. Validation is essential to the development of such models, as it verifies that the simulation can reproduce expected results. This work explores methods for quantifying emotion in historic presidential and elite speech data for later use in model validation. Here, data were collected for cases in which genocide was expected and either did or did not occur. After digitization of a subset of the speech archive, early emotion analysis using a modern lexicon on translated text shows variations in emotions that correspond as expected to events along the case timeline, thus providing preliminary measures for historic case comparison in general social science research and appropriate artificial simulations. Future improvements in analytical technique and digitization processes will allow for continued work and contributions to the domain of genocide studies. A repository of digitized files, along with the full set of original texts, are also made available. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"The objective of this bibliographic review of Architectural Graphic Expression (EGA) in the six-year period 2017-2022 is to offer an informative account of its referential theoretical framework, current lines of research and the knowledge transfer from this area of the Spanish university to society. The scientific production by EGA professors in Spain is disseminated through articles in scientific journals and other means of sharing knowledge such as books, congresses, exhibitions and other dissemination activities. Of these references, the books for this bibliographic review have been selected. The monographs and collective publications are the last phase in the communication of the results of a research project. They have a broad and summarised content but accessing it to that knowledge is complex since because many books do not have open digital editions and, therefore, are not indexed by title or keywords like other scientific publications. This text offers the keys to create an updated library where the thematic diversity of EGA is represented, which, since its constitution in 1984, includes history and theory of Shape Analysis, Descriptive Geometry, Architectural Drawing, and the application of its graphic procedures to multidisciplinary heritage research. © 2023 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia.

"We introduce and describe an unsupervised text-analytic method which we hypothesize could help an analyst seeking to make sense of the information landscape to be able to pinpoint, from a high level, the sources of fringe narratives and beliefs. The method is premised on the idea set forth in [1] that cults can often be recognized ‘in the wild’ through their distinctive vocabulary. Building on concepts from unsupervised learning, we generalize this idea to posit that even if we did not know a priori which particular ‘distinctive vocabulary’ identified an as-yet unknown ‘fringe belief’, the texts which are representative of ‘fringe’ beliefs should, in general, stand out from the ‘mainstream’ of text when anomaly detection techniques are applied. We test our hypothesis first by constructing an artificial dataset in which we hand-select 27 snippets of text representative of a set of ‘fringe’ beliefs about Russia and approximately the length of Twitter posts, add approximately 20,000 Twitter posts gathered using ‘neutral’ words relevant to the topic of the 27 texts, and then applying our technique while withholding from it which source each text came from. We find that the technique can indeed direct the attention of the analyst to the 27 texts, the ‘needle in the haystack’. We then test the hypothesis again by applying the technique to 2,838 articles from Russian-language media sources in 2022, including three based in Moscow, and one which relocated to Latvia in 2014 to escape Kremlin control and censorship. We hypothesize that in the Russian news media landscape, the independent media organization should appear as ‘fringe’. Again, our hypothesis is confirmed. There were also some surprises in the results, which we discuss—along with how related techniques can also pinpoint what about the ‘fringe’ in each case differentiates it from the mainstream. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Visual anthropological materials, in particular, documentary films, played a significant role in forming the perception of in the 20th century. In the 1920s in the USSR, the North was one of the main locations of the shooting of ethnogeographic films. Created in the region, theyliterally became the discovery of this territory for the capitals and the central regions population. Based on the analysis of archival materials, periodicals and newsreel data, the article introduces into scientific circulation information about the film “Our Great North” by L. K Verigo-Dorovsky. The method of analysis of the film was its research interpretation -presentation in the form of a film text. The author demonstrates potential of a film document as a tool for recording and broadcasting the ethno-cultural and economic potential of the region as a multi-layered historical source. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The analysis of the writing style of multi-authored texts aims at identifying those places where authorship changes in a document. This task is an important step in reliably identifying the authors of a given text. This year, we ask participants to solve an intrinsic style change detection task: For a given text, find all places where the writing style changes at the paragraph-level. To control for topic information as a style change signal, we provide participants with data sets with three levels of difficulty and thus different thematic variants. This paper presents the multiple author writing style analysis task, the underlying data set, the approaches used by participants, and the results obtained. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"The theoretical field of biopol‑ itics — currently being actively devel‑ oped — is used in this study as a basis for understanding the actions of govern‑ ments and communities represented by state and non‑state media during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Media narratives about the pandemic are analyzed in the context of the biopolitical theories pro‑ posed by Michel Foucault, Georges Ag‑ amben, and Carsten Schubert. It is as‑ sumed that in the neo‑liberal regimes of the European Union, the mass me‑ dia will broadcast ideas that correspond to state biopolitical projects. The study aimed at assessing the capacity of the mass media to become an actor of “dem‑ ocratic biopolitics”. The authors conduct a comparative analysis of Russian, Ger‑ man, and French media materials about the pandemic published during four its waves (January 2020 — March 2022). Total number of analysed texts amounted to 21658 in three Russian media, 59149 in German and 58432 in French media. The study is based on the propaganda model of Herman and Chomsky, and at the instrumental level, the authors use the method of searching for “contextu‑ al ideologemes”. The contextual ideol‑ ogeme “vaccination” plays a key role in the analysis of media discourse. The re‑ sults of the study show that the media are actors of biopolitics and a commu‑ nication channel connecting the state, business, and society. Mass media dis‑ course can be considered as an edito‑ rial policy tool behind which stands the owner who is not directly involved in the pharmaceutical business, but for various reasons supports the biopolitical practic‑ es of the government. Interaction with the media in the field of biopolitical pro‑ grams on the part of the state and busi‑ ness requires further research. © 2023 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM.

"The article is devoted to the analysis of folk literature monuments, namely parable texts, presented in popular engravings. Parables used to serve as both entertaining and edifying readings; they could also be used as material for church sermons. Popular engravings may involve classical prose parables and ones composed in syllabic verse, which correlate with the “school” baroque poetic tradition. Part of the parables featured on engraved sheets originate from the gospel texts. Other parables can be associated with both translated and original works of Old Russian literature. Besides, one distinguishes parable texts sourced from Western European engravings. Most of the parables, which became part of popular engravings, come from the collection of stories Velikoe Zertsalo (‘Great Mirror’) translated from Polish into Church Slavonic. Other texts of non-evangelical origin made their way to engravings through the collections Prolog (‘Prologue’) and Zlatoust (‘Chrysostom’). It is important to conclude that the Slavia Orthodoxa and the Slavia Romana traditions share common moralising storylines. © 2023, Jan Stanislav Institute of Slavistics, Slovak Committee of Slavists.

"For text clustering, there is often a dilemma: one can either first embed each examples independently and then compute pair-wise similarities based on the embeddings, or use a crossattention model that takes a pair of examples as input and produces a similarity. The former is more scalable but the similarities often have lower quality, whereas the latter does not scale well but produces higher quality similarities. We address this dilemma by developing a clustering algorithm that leverages the best of both worlds: the scalability of former and the quality of the latter. We formulate the problem of text clustering with embeddingbased and cross-attention models as a novel version of the Budgeted Correlation Clustering problem (BCC) where along with a limited number of queries to an expensive oracle (a cross-attention model in our case), we have unlimited access to a cheaper but less accurate second oracle (embedding similarities in our case). We develop a theoretically motivated algorithm that leverages the cheap oracle to judiciously query the strong oracle while maintaining high clustering quality. We empirically demonstrate gains in query minimization and clustering metrics on a variety of datasets with diverse strong and cheap oracles. © 2023 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

"This paper describes the approach developed by the Fraunhofer SIT team in the CLEF-2023 CheckThat! lab challenge for check-worthiness detection in multimodal and unimodal content. Check-worthiness detection aims to facilitate manual fact-checking efforts by prioritizing the statements that fact-checkers should consider first. It can also be seen as the first step of a fact-checking system. Our approach was ranked first in Task 1A and second in Task 1B. The goal of Task 1A is to determine whether a claim in a tweet that contains both a snippet of text and an image is worth fact-checking. For this task, we propose a novel way to detect check-worthiness. It takes advantage of two classifiers, each trained on a single modality. For image data, extracting the embedded text with an OCR analysis has shown to perform best. By combining the two classifiers, the proposed solution was able to place first in Task 1A with an F1 score of 0.7297 achieved on the private test set. The aim of Task 1B is to determine whether a text snippet from a political debate it should be assessed for check-worthiness. Our best-performing method takes advantage of an ensemble classification scheme centered on Model Souping. When applied to the English data set, our submitted model achieved an overall F1 score of 0.878 and was ranked as the second-best model in the competition. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"This article presents an approach for predicting Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedure sheets, which are commonly used in the manufacturing industry to prevent premature equipment restart during maintenance. The prediction problem of energetic devices to lock from machine names is regarded as a multi-task classification problem. The dataset was obtained by processing LOTO sheets in Portable Document Format (PDF). The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms were compared for this problem. The best prediction performance was achieved with the DNN method, with top-1 accuracies exceeding 63% and top-2 accuracies exceeding 90% for all devices. The sensitivity analysis conducted on the results indicates that the approach is robust and reliable, regardless of the industrial sector considered. In other words, the approach is not significantly affected by variations in the industry or its specific characteristics. These results suggest that the proposed approach can be used to assist workers in drafting LOTO sheets, and offers strong potential for concrete applications in safety management in the era of smart manufacturing. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"It is commonly accepted that educators who prepare to teach materials to meet student needs should cover all skills in English, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing with additional grammar and vocabulary according to the level of students. Because technology has developed rapidly, educators can design technologically friendly teaching materials or textbooks for mobile phones. One recommendation is using quick response (QR) codes where students can scan and learn to listen to the audio while reading the text provided in the textbook. This activity, listening and reading simultaneously or consecutively, is called the meaning-focused input learning approach. This study used 2D out of 4D (four-D) development model by Thiagarajan (1974), namely, define and design to inform (1) the steps for embedding QR codes in the textbook and (2) to run QR code scanning systems in English textbooks. In the definition stage, the authors performed the following diagnoses: learning activities analysis, learner analysis, task analysis, and concept analysis. Meanwhile, for the design stage, the authors presented QR codes as teaching materials in textbooks compiled through the steps of free, quick, and easy applications, namely 1) converting texts to audio files using the apps Text to Speech (TTS) Free; 2) merging the audio files using Clideo; 3) uploading the audio files into Google Drive; 4) creating QR code through QR code Generator to embed into textbooks. The results of this study contribute to materials development in many ways and assist stakeholders in education, such as EFL teachers, curriculum designers, and policymakers. © 2023 Asociacion Mexicana de Maestros de Ingles MEXTESOL A.C.

"Introduction: This study aims to analyze the influence of syphilis among people with sexual and gender diversity, different from the binary dimension. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted as a method to address the objective of the study, based on the Dialectical Structural Model of Care (DSM), to obtain the phenomenon from the perspective of cultural history. Results: In this review the analysis of 129 documents, of which 22 texts were used. The construction of sex and gender in Western civilization is based on the Judeo-Christian tradition, which permitted many people throughout history to be persecuted and mistreated for living a lifestyle different from that dictated by religious and traditional canons. Therefore, throughout history, gender-diverse people, sexual minorities, and prostitutes have suffered segregation, mockery, aggression, and health problems, including syphilis. Conclusions: Despite having a treatment and cure, syphilis has stood the test of time and has remained a secret pathology that is obscure and difficult to detect disease, which is still very much present in people of all social classes. It is necessary to review history to understand the reasons why syphilis is still prevalent in different societies today.

"The main topic of this work is to develop a framework to extract Real-World Evidence through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks. An initial literature analysis has been performed, from which it clearly emerges that adverse events concerning Health Information Technology (HIT) are gradually growing over time. The goal of the proposed framework is to automatically identify adverse event reports related to HIT, aiming to support Health Technology Assessment and Post Market Surveillance as outlined in European Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices. The designed model uses a pre-trained version of ClinicalBERT, additionally fine-tuned on 3, 705 adverse events reports extracted from the FDA MAUDE database, which had been previously manually labelled by experts. Results show better metrics than other existing HIT adverse events reports text classifiers based on non-BERT models, performing with an accuracy of 0.9906, precision of 0.9840, recall of 0.9973, and F1 score of 0.9906. © 2023 Convegno Nazionale di Bioingegneria.

"Introduction. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is an effective minimally invasive manipulation that has been widely applied in obstetric and gynecological practice. The expediency of using this method of surgical treatment in patients with reproductive plans is still controversial. The main clinicians' concerns are the risk of developing local endometrial ischemia able to lead to habitual miscarriage, premature birth and pathological placentation as well as decreased ovarian reserve due to impaired adequate ovarian blood supply. Aim: to analyze the literature data regarding UAE effect on reproductive function. Materials and Methods. The search for literature was carried out in databases Web of Science, eLibrary, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE. We selected articles for the years 1995–2023 devoted to assessing UAE influence on reproductive function. The articles were searched by the keywords ""embolization"", ""uterine arteries"", ""reproductive function"", ""prognosis"", ""assessment"". No methodological filter was used to exclude the omission of suitable articles. The study included full-text sources and literary reviews on the subject under study. Articles that are not directly related to the subject UAE were excluded from the review. In order to avoid the inclusion of duplicate publications if two same author studies were found, the study period of each author was assessed, and if publication dates coincided, the most recent publication was selected. Results. Based on the review of domestic and foreign literature sources over recent years, it can be concluded that there are restrictions on the frequency and outcomes of pregnancy in such cohort of patients who underwent UAE. Many patients included in existing studies and case reports have variable factors complicating direct analysis or comparison such as age of patients, previous spontaneous abortions, previous uterine surgery, different techniques and professional training of X-ray endovascular surgeons, uncertainty of a woman regarding further reproductive plans and other forms of infertility, which can also distort research results. In addition, the most well-controlled studies often have small patients sample sizes not allowing to obtain meaningful clinical information from thereof. Conclusion. Pregnancy is possible in women after UAE, and many of these pregnancies proceed without complications and lead to successful childbirth. The actual fertility rate after UAE remains uncertain, but is approaching 38.3 % based on the available published results. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Existing textual keyword extraction mainly uses unsupervised methods that are more generalised and less costly and only require the selection of a method for evaluating keywords, such as the frequency and location of this word, by which possible keywords are extracted; however, this statistical-based method does not make use of the meaning of keywords in context. Due to the popularity of pre-trained language models (PLM), embedded-based methods have gained more application in unsupervised keyword extraction (UKE) tasks. We designed a new UKE approach to jointly model the feature information of candidate keyphrase at both sentence and phrase levels by PLM. First extract key sentences as a summary of the source document, obtain the candidate keyphrase from the summary sentences by syntactic analysis and lexical annotation and calculate the node centrality of the candidate keyword graph by fusing the candidate node position information to obtain the correlation information between the candidate word nodes; We also introduce an attention mechanism to enhance the capture of local feature information by computing for each candidate keyword its attention value in the above text. We evaluate our approach on three public commonly used keyword extraction datasets. Through the experimental analysis can be known that our model outperforms most models compared to the existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The article offers a close textual analysis of Cindy Pon’s speculative young adult (YA) novels, Want and Ruse, focused on the role of technology as both a facilitator of oppression and a tool for resisting it. This article explores the potential of speculative science fiction novels to help readers explore the complex social and material entanglements of digital technologies. The article also discusses the dual pedagogical layers of speculative YA texts as direct contributors to readers’ understandings of the world and as educational tools within language arts classrooms. The author argues that, as technology continues to shape and transform society, it is crucial for scholars to examine the way digital tools and literacies are portrayed in speculative texts, particularly those aimed at younger readers, and to encourage students to critically engage with them. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Wouldn't it be great if we could query large, diverse data lakes of tables, text, and databases as easily as using Siri or Alexa? The problem is hard from two perspectives: integrating data lakes requires data normalization/transformation, schema matching, and entity resolution and is notoriously hard, with high human cost. Even if successful, such integration efforts typically do not support arbitrary SQL queries over the integrated data set. In this paper, we propose Symphony, a novel system that enables users to easily query complex, multi-modal data lakes without performing upfront integration. For ease of use, Symphony adopts a natural language (NL) interface. To avoid integration, it employs a unified representation for multi-modal datasets, called cross-modality representation learning. When a user poses an NL query, Symphony discovers which tables or textual data should be retrieved based on the learned cross-modal representations, decomposes a complicated NL query into NL sub-queries on-demand, evaluates each sub-query on one data source and combines the results from these sub-queries. A preliminary evaluation shows that the resulting system is able to effectively answer questions over tables and text extracted from Wikipedia. © 2023 13th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2023.

"The objective of author profiling (AP) is to study the characteristics of authors through the analysis of how language is exchanged among people. Studying these attributes sometimes is challenging due to the lack of annotated data. This indicates the significance of studying AP from a low-resource perspective. This year at AP@PAN 2023 the major interest raised in profiling cryptocurrency influencers with a few-shot learning technique to analyze the effectiveness of advanced approaches in dealing with new tasks from a low-resource perspective. The AP-2023 task consists of 3 subtasks including cryptocurrency influencer analysis, interest identification, and intent identification. In this work, we studied the integration of Bi-Encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs), to enhance the semantic representation of authors by enabling the models to transfer knowledge across domains and adapt to new tasks with a small number of data. We incorporated multi-losses to enforce LLMs to learn the representations of different categories and authors to facilitate similarity-based comparisons among authors and categories. Finally, our approach achieved impressive F1 Macro scores of 52.31 for crypto influencer profiling, 61.21 for crypto influencer interest identification, and 65.83 for crypto influencer intent identification using limited supervised learning data. Overall, the obtained and experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of the integration of multiple-loss learners with LLMs in profiling cryptocurrency influencers using limited resources. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"This article deals with the peculiarities of the hashtagging process and the functioning of hashtags in print advertising. The importance of the research is explained by the linguists’ interest to the problem of the composition of a creolized advertising text, verbal and non-verbal means of expressing explicit and implicit meanings as well as units of linguistic compression. Important for the representativeness of the topic is the lack of knowledge of the specifics of the hashtagging process, types and functions of specific hashtags in creolized advertising texts. The sources of the study included Russian editions of international magazines published in 2019-2022: Tatler, Elle Decoration, Cosmopolitan, Men’s Health, Elle, Esquire, GQ, etc. To interpret the factual material, communicative-pragmatic and descriptive methods as well as the method of quantitative analysis were applied. The results of the study show that hashtags function predominantly in additive and image-centric types of creolized texts where the iconic component plays a leading role. They occupy a strong position in the composition of such texts and often functionally get closer to slogans. It is noted that the hashtags of advertising discourse of glossy publications are not distinguished by thematic diversity and represent three groups: “Clothing, footwear, accessories of premium class”, “Perfume and cosmetic products of global brands”, “Jewelry and watches of famous brands”. It was found that the hashtagging process in the analyzed texts has a number of specific features. Such features include the use of one-, two- and three-component hashtags, optional underlining, the dominance of hashtags in Latin rather than Cyrillic in the graphics, the rarity of language mixing, the activity of hashtags-phrases and hashtags-sentences. The author concludes that hashtags in the advertising communication of international magazines are distinguished by functional differentiation and multifunctionality. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This paper proposes supervised contrastive learning with a p-tuning method to solve the Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis task. The motivation is to capture more detail of the variation between the two paragraphs and exploit the potential performance of the pre-trained models. Therefore, we combine two methods, the Rdrop method and the supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) method, with p-tuning technology. Then trained and evaluated the three challenging Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis datasets (easy, medium, hard), which the PAN gave, and we achieved a score of 98.280, 83.035, 82.081 on each of the three difficulty tests set on the f1 metric. In addition, we conducted ablation experiments, which proved that supervised contrastive learning was beneficial in capturing more detailed changes in text and stimulating the potential of pre-trained models performance. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"In Indonesia, the Merdeka Curriculum's learning process mandates using books as essential teaching tools. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia regulates book quality standards to ensure book quality. To meet the book quality standards outlined in this regulation, it is necessary to have a tool that can analyze the text readability in the book. Assessing text readability can be accomplished by employing a readability formula and constructing a machine-learning model. In this study, we focus on analyzing the readability of Indonesian texts. We build readability models by applying readability formula and machine learning approach as a two-step process. The first step is classifying the text into two categories: complex and simple, and the next step is identifying the text difficulty level according to readability formula. The readability formula measures the grade level and reader age. The experimental results show that the machine learning model successfully classified the text with 83.1% accuracy. On the other hand, the result of the readability formula is that the readability age is higher than the reader's age. The result of the readability formula is the predicted readability age is higher than the intended reader age. We analyzed the readability result and found that Indonesian textbook has more complex linguistic feature than English textbook, therefore the predicted reader age is higher.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Tourism industry has been instrumental in the growth of hotels globally, and the rise of online booking systems has led to a surge in online hotel reviews. Currently, travelers are keen to share their experiences, making online hotel reviews a valuable source of information. However, reading and understanding these reviews can be time-consuming and challenging, as human language is complex, and sentiment analysis requires high accuracy. This paper focuses on the development and evaluation of a sentiment analysis model for hotel reviews using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective of the model is to assist hotel staff in gaining insights from online reviews. Traditional sentiment analysis algorithms have limitations and have reached a plateau in their performance. The experiment was conducted on six hotel reviews in Langkawi using Word2vec in Python generates word embeddings, and vector representations of words that enable effective natural language processing. The parameters used in the CNN algorithm, such as batch size, filter size, dropout, and data split between training and testing, were varied that need to be experimented with to find the high accuracy of CNN model. The results of the experiments showed that the CNN model achieved high accuracy of more than 90%, making it an effective text classification method. Moreover, the models with a dropout rate of 0.1 consistently outperformed the models with a higher dropout rate of 0.5 in terms of accuracy. The study used the CNN model to create a prototype for predicting the sentiment of hotel reviews. Results showed that the CNN algorithm is a reliable tool for sentiment analysis in the hotel industry, as it provides high accuracy and valuable insights from online reviews.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Rumor prevention is a widespread problem in the world today. Most approaches on rumor detection are passive after rumor occurrence, while few are active rumor prevention methods. The passive rumor control usually consumes more manpower, time and resources, which increases the cost of social management. This study employs big data methods and provides an active rumor prevention method based on knowledge graph called KGRP Algorithm. This approach firstly collects a large amount of online rumor data, and constructs the rumor knowledge graph based on text analysis. Secondly the knowledge correlations among rumors are set up according to the knowledge graph, and the rumor warning index is generated based on the correlations. Experimental simulation results illustrate that this method has high accuracy for rumor warning. This method can provide convenience for rumor control.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Social media post such as tweet in Twitter is one of main source of text analysis. However, the large amount of data collected often contain noise, such as irrelevance post that affect system inaccuracy. One that may affect system inaccuracy is the abundance of headlines text. Headlines text is a part of the text that describes the text below it. Therefore, this study designed an effective method to collect text headlines and non-headline texts, as well as building a model to detect text headlines. The data collection method developed had low error rates, making it a good reference for obtaining text headlines and non-headline text. The model built to detect text headlines had good performance with the highest accuracy is achieved by the IndoBERTweet model at 0.9921. The CNN and fastText models built had lower accuracy of 0.9081 and 0.8793 respectively, but were 200-2000x faster than IndoBERTweet. Moreover, our findings revealed that more than half of the total data in the four COVID-19 related topics comprised text headlines. Furthermore, the observed errors in the studied models can be attributed to the complex intrinsic properties of a headline text, fastText limitations in representing non-standardized words, and the training data used to build the fastText model.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The study is devoted to the characterization of the genres of labor rituals of the Altaians from the point of view of their historicism: hunting wishes and incantations, cattle-breeding, and agricultural incantations. The various speech genres and rituals surrounding work serve to regulate human behavior, develop labor skills, and provide guidelines for interacting with the environment in everyday life. The study materials included published and unpublished texts on the labor rituals of the Altaians. Combining the historical-typological method with the contextual analysis of ritual texts allowed the specifics of the folklore genres under consideration to be identified. A conclusion is drawn that some genres of labor activity continue to exist in the natural environment and are considered unique phenomena in the modern lifestyle of the Altaians. A feature of hunting and agricultural wishes is their relationship with the animistic cult of nature worship. An important pragmatic component of hunting wishes is expressing a wish in order to obtain what is desired. The essential magical practices of the Southern Altai people include the compulsion to accept a newborn calf in case the uterus refuses to feed it. The Southern Altaians sing incantations to domestic animals, with certain extra-linguistic words-symbols fixed for each animal. The agricultural rituals of the Altaians in the past were associated with grain cultivation since cereals were of paramount importance in their diet. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Is a metaphor a bad thing, especially in those areas of communication where we expect accuracy, precision and unambiguity? Is it possible to make such exact statements in relation to the phenomena that constitute the object of cognition, which, thanks to language, are rather the object of the human conception of them? They thus fall within the realm of epistemology, not ontology. This is what I deal with in this article, which is based on the text of the lecture I gave at my habilitation colloquium at Technische Universität Berlin on 13 June 2022. The text is, in a sense, an abbreviated excerpt from my considerations, which I have spread out over more than a thousand pages in my habilitation thesis, which will be published next year. The study I have conducted is innovative and represents a change to the previous paradigm of terminology research due to the method of analysis of the object of study. The innovation of my study is that I move away from analysing the semantic transformations of individual lexical units and capture the principles of the constitution of entire terminological systems. © 2023 Centro Universitario Sao Camilo.

"cases of violations of the Law on Electronic Information and Transaction (UU ITE) which are dominated by cases related to hacking and fake documents. An interesting fact is that a number of cases were found with evidence that points to the falsification of texts and someone's authorship. Proofing authorship dispute cases in Indonesia has not reached an analysis of authorship, because of the difficulty of identifying personal identity in electronic texts, especially in short texts with limited characters and words. This study examines Indonesian text set to investigate and describe linguistic profiles based on N-gram analysis and style characteristics. The data source in this study is Corpora of electronic text sets from 50 unique authors, including 8 authors and evidence from criminal cases, which are limited to 2000 characters or 500 words. All texts are personal texts that are collected from volunteers and case documents that are permitted to be accessed. Data analysis was carried out by determining and calculating the n-grams, both on the character-level and word-level, and performing stylometric features that the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library extracts. The results of the data analysis show that lexically, the character-level n-gram analysis, as the smallest n-unit, shows an important element of authorship attribution, such as the use of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, capitalization, and punctuation. Diction is a significant factor to identify the author's profile and distinguish between one author and another. The results of using the small text set are able to demonstrate authorship attribution to identify authors, with the various stylistic features, resulting in a classification accuracy of between 92% and 98.5%.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Based on the instructional design model ADDIE and the principle of goal-oriented course design, this study uses tools such as Python and GooSeeKer to analyze the high-frequency words, quantity changes and proportions, semantic relationships, and emotional changes in the bullet screen text of the online open course 'Grade 9 Mathematics' on Bilibili, using a combined quantitative and qualitative analysis method. It was found that learners can engage in creative thinking regarding course content, exhibit high levels of semantic association during interactions, and provide positive feedback on the course overall. However, there are also issues such as a lack of effective supervision leading to deviation from preset goals and fluctuating levels of learning engagement. Based on the analysis results, a model for online course design is proposed, with recommendations for online course development from four dimensions: course goals, course design principles, technical means, and learning feedback. This study attempts to answer questions such as 'how to design effective and learner-satisfactory online courses.'  © 2023 IEEE."

"The paper examines the functions of “tradition” in the Catholic critical discourse basing on the works of one of the most provocative catholic authors of the second half of the 20th century. The meaning of “tradition” in Catholic theology seems to be rather vague; however, in the works of the 20th century theologians it is possible to trace two general aspects of this concept, i.e. tradition as a transcendent truth, given by God, and tradition as an order, custom or teaching, created by people, historical in its character. The transcendent core of tradition has a strong positive connotation, while its historical aspect can be subject to critique. These two aspects are used both by the adherents of a conservative policy, and by the supporters of church reforms, which testifies to a certain flexibility of the term. Eugen Drewermann, one of the most notable modern critics of the Catholic Church, uses the concept in question in a negative sense, which increases the critical potential of his argument. This critical effect does not result singularly from the definition of “tradition” that Drewermann gives in his texts. In order to describe the specificity of the use of this concept and to reconstruct its critical potential, the article analyses the concept of “tradition” basing on Drewermann’s three-volume thesis, Structures of Evil, where he combined biblical exegesis with current psychoanalytic knowledge, and Depth Psychology and Exegesis, where he continues to develop his innovative exegetical method. This approach makes it possible to trace how the concept acquires negative connotations: by excluding the transcendent aspect from the field of its denoting sense, by discussing religion in terms of psychoanalysis, as well as by linking tradition to such negatively connoted terms as “fear”, “neuroticism”, “the external” and contrasting it to “the objective”, “the internal”, “the natural” and “true”. Eugen Drewermann’s critical interpretation of tradition based on the psychological understanding of religion deprives Christianity of its transcendent origin and delegitimises the modern institutional form of Catholicism, which allows him to radicalise the question of the extent to which the Church is liable to change. © 2023 St. Tikhon's University.

"The article examines the image of fire in the Ladder of John Climacus on the basis of the manuscripts of the first Slavic translation of monument. The main verbalizer of the concept “fire” is the lexeme πΰρ огнь, which occurs 71 times in the book: 17 times in the designation of fire as a physical phenomenon and 54 times in a symbolic sense (18 times as punishing fire and 36 times as blessed fire). Fire lives in heart of a monk, and it can be both the fire of love and the fire of passions. The main function of lexeme fire in the Ladder is to designate fire as a servant of God, who can both punish and pardon. The punishing fire can be God himself, Gehenna and passions in the human soul. The merciful fire can be God himself and good deeds (prayer, faith, crying, etc.). Statistical analysis led to the conclusion that the main function of image of fire in the Ladder is the designation of love for the Lord. The article names the Byzantine codices of the Ladder, close to the text of the lost original of the first Slavic translation, indicates the errors of scribe of the oldest manuscript of the translation, and also names 4 lexemes that are not recorded in the historical dictionaries of the Russian and Old Slavonic languages. © 2023, Tatiana G.

"In the complex field of urban phenomenon analysis and representation, this text addresses the evolution of works specifically dedicated to investigating the relationships established between individuals and the city. It focuses its attention on one of the less studied aspects: the cartographic representation of subjective, emotional, and perceptual aspects related to the experience of navigating and inhabiting an urban space. The city cannot be considered as a neutral or objective space; on the contrary, there will always be an imaginary construct that shapes and accompanies it. This imaginary construct, which determines our way of perceiving, being, and moving within the city, is fundamental for a comprehensive understanding of urban processes and dynamics. Approaching this dialectical relationship between the physical and subjective dimensions of the city, which is intangible in itself, through analysis and graphic representation is now possible thanks to theoretical and, above all, technological advancements. The objective of this text is to contextualize this process by presenting two frames of reference: one conceptual, linked to the evolution of the term “landscape,” and another methodological, focused on presenting the technical advancements that have been decisive in the evolution of this type of representation. We take a journey through cartographic experiences initiated in the 1960s and arrive at some of the most innovative research lines in this field, such as Biomapping, real-time cartographies, or intelligent cartographies. The aim of the article is to reinforce and emphasize the utility of graphic expression as a tool for urban and territorial decision-making, highlighting its capacity to represent even the most sensitive and complex data. Through a panoramic view of the advancements achieved in recent decades regarding these types of cartographies, it illustrates the interesting convergence that can be delineated today between the traditionally connected areas of graphic expression in Architecture and Urbanism and the new scenarios of data management and analysis. © 2023 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia.

"“Anti-Protestant” or, rather, “anti-Luther” and “anti-Calvin” verses by Mikhail Rogov and Ivan Nasedka-Shevelev, written in the period from the 1620s to the 1640s largely responded to the time trends. The intolerant attitude towards the heretical creeds of various foreigners in Muscovy, the religious and philosophical literary controversy, the political realities of those years — all this was reflected in verses poetry, which continues the tradition of anti-Protestant treatises known in Old Russia since the 16th century. Analysis of the ideological and artistic originality of the “anti-Protestant” verses that took shape in the first half of the 17th century, thanks to the efforts of the figures of the Moscow Printing House, allows us to talk about some general aspects of the poetics of works of a religious and dogmatic nature. However, despite the similarity of the artistic attitudes of the two authors, Nasedka’s Exposition on Luthors and the “anti-Protestant” verses in the Rogov’s Preface to Cyril’s Book from the point of view of poetics do not at all represent a single literary text that is identical in style, as they say different approaches to addressing and naming Protestant ideologists and movements. In the verses on the one hand, one feels the knowledge of the basic foundations of Protestantism, on the other hand, there is no understanding of the theological differences between Lutheranism and Calvinism. The poetry of Nasedka-Shevelev and Rogov testifies authors’ desire to fill these gaps in their own style, colorfully talking about the features of the Lutheran doctrine in a negative way, necessary to create a sharply polemical work. © 2023, Marianna V.

"Through a case study of the holograph letters of Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots (1489–1541), this article examines the centuries-old editorial debate of whether to modernise or preserve the old-spelling of early modern texts. I examine how historical biographers and editors have approached and presented the language of Margaret Tudor’s letters and consider the implications their editorial approaches have on how readers perceive the figure and epistolary voice of Margaret Tudor. I then draw upon two recent studies in the field of linguistics to show how the detailed analysis of diplomatic transcriptions of Margaret Tudor’s holograph letters can provide important new insights and a fuller understanding of Margaret’s sociolinguistic history, her dual identity as English princess and Queen of Scots, and the processes and agents involved in the production of her holograph correspondence. This article argues for the necessity of diplomatic editions and for an editorial approach that carefully attends to and contextualises the language of early modern women’s letters. The article contends that such an approach is central to developing more advanced and nuanced understandings of early modern women and their letters. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Authorship Analysis (AA) is a research area that aims to investigate and identify characteristics in the writing style in text documents to extract relevant information about the author. One of the most common tasks in recent years within this area is Authorship Verification (AV). AV aims to determine if two given text documents were written or not by the same author by measuring different characteristics. The PAN@CLEF 2023 AV challenge [1][2] requires solving the task on a cross-discourse type and open-set collection of essays, emails, interviews, and speech transcriptions. We model a text graph representation and build a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract relevant features from the text documents. Specifically, we use a heterogeneous text graph representing the entire corpus, then use it as input for a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to obtain learning vectors (embeddings), and finally use these vectors to train a classification model (fully connected network). © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Videos contain visual and auditory information. Visual information in a video can include images of people, objects, and the landscape, whereas auditory information includes voices, sound effects, background music, and the soundscape. The audio content can provide detailed information on the story by conducting a voice and atmosphere analysis of the sound effects and soundscape. Metadata tags represent the results of a media analysis as text. The tags can classify video content on social networking services, like YouTube. This paper presents the methodologies of speech, audio, and music processing. Also, we propose integrating these audio tagging methods and applying them in an audio metadata generation system for video storytelling. The proposed system automatically creates metadata tags based on speech, sound effects, and background music information from the audio input. The proposed system comprises five subsystems: (1) automatic speech recognition, which generates text from the linguistic sounds in the audio, (2) audio event classification for the type of sound effect, (3) audio scene classification for the type of place from the soundscape, (4) music detection for the background music, and (5) keyword extraction from the automatic speech recognition results. First, the audio signal is converted into a suitable form, which is subsequently combined from each subsystem to create metadata for the audio content. We evaluated the proposed system using video logs (vlogs) on YouTube. The proposed system exhibits a similar accuracy to handcrafted metadata for the audio content, and for a total of 104 YouTube vlogs, achieves an accuracy of 65.83%.  © 2023 River Publishers."
"Background: In the context of the ongoing crisis in early reading literacy in South Africa, this article gives insight into teacher practices which reduce learners’ opportunities to read continuous text for meaning. Aim: This ethnographic study investigated the microcosm of teacher practices in well-resourced environments. Setting: A purposive sample was drawn of three Grade One teachers in former Model C primary schools for intensive investigation of their literacy teaching practices. A pilot study established that a literacy teaching event resembling Group Guided Reading was attended every day by every learner in these classrooms and therefore provided the focal event in the research. Method: Micro-ethnographic classroom observations, with accompanying video recordings and transcriptions were the primary data sources. Interviews provided narrative and descriptive data. Data were analysed by means of qualitative content analysis and discourse analysis. Results: Findings suggested that the introduction of flashcards and texts designed for phonics practice into a methodology designed to promote reading for meaning has a cumulative impact on the time teachers spend on discussion, modelling comprehension strategies and silent reading. Potentially this limits learners to only one of the four roles of a reader, that is, a reader as code breaker. Conclusion: Findings caution against teachers making changes to the requirements of explicit teaching methodologies. The aims of Group Guided Reading are not achievable when phonics instruction reduces engagement with continuous text. Contribution: This article, by critiquing a practice, encourages teachers and teacher educators to consider the balance between whole-language and phonics-based approaches. © 2023. The Author."
"To clarify the challenges of young carer support among professionals engaged in community-based integrated care in the eastern area of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, as a basis for determining the role of community-based integrated support centers in such support. We conducted an open-ended web questionnaire survey, involving 87 professionals who had participated in a young carer support training seminar planned by a community-based integrated support center, and performed quantitative text analysis to identify the challenges of young carer support. Fifty-one professionals responded (response rate: 58.6%). The 5 most frequent words were led by “necessary” (32), followed by “collaboration” (27), “think” (26), “educational institution” (22), and “support” (17). Through co-occurrence network analysis, 4 network groups, <challenges in grasping young carers>, <challenges of the community>, <challenges related to support systems>, and <challenges related to collaboration>, were formed. The results indicated the necessity of organizing support systems that enable the identification of young carers through the establishment of laws and systems, and promoting collaboration between the community and health, medical, welfare, and education fields to support young carers in communities. Community-based integrated support centers are expected to play a pivotal role as a base for facilitating such collaboration. © 2023 Asian Journal of Human Services, All rights reserved."
"Purpose: This paper aims to use text mining methods to explore the similarities and differences between countries’ national digital transformation (DT) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) policies. The study examines the applicability of text mining as an alternative for comprehensive clustering of national I4.0 and DT strategies, encouraging policy researchers toward data science that can offer rapid policy analysis and benchmarking. Design/methodology/approach: With an exploratory research approach, topic modeling, principal component analysis and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means and hierarchical clustering) are used for clustering national I4.0 and DT strategies. This paper uses a corpus of policy documents and related scientific publications from several countries and integrate their science and technology performance. The paper also presents the positioning of Türkiye’s I4.0 and DT national policy as a case from a developing country context. Findings: Text mining provides meaningful clustering results on similarities and differences between countries regarding their national I4.0 and DT policies, aligned with their geographic, economic and political circumstances. Findings also shed light on the DT strategic landscape and the key themes spanning various policy dimensions. Drawing from the Turkish case, political options are discussed in the context of developing (follower) countries’ I4.0 and DT. Practical implications: The paper reveals meaningful clustering results on similarities and differences between countries regarding their national I4.0 and DT policies, reflecting political proximities aligned with their geographic, economic and political circumstances. This can help policymakers to comparatively understand national DT and I4.0 policies and use this knowledge to reflect collaborative and competitive measures to their policies. Originality/value: This paper provides a unique combined methodology for text mining-based policy analysis in the DT context, which has not been adopted. In an era where computational social science and machine learning have gained importance and adaptability to political and social science fields, and in the technology and innovation management discipline, clustering applications showed similar and different policy patterns in a timely and unbiased manner. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Background: Acinetobacter baumannii produce biofilm and efflux pumps. This systematic review study aimed to provide new strategies to inhibit the efflux pumps and biofilm in A. baumannii using nanoparticles. Methods: In this research, analyses from 2000 to February 24, 2022, were performed by the Statement of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). Keywords include Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) AND (biofilm) AND (anti-biofilm activity) AND (nanoparticles) AND (solid lipid NPS) AND (lipid nanocarriers), and in other searches include Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumanni) AND (efflux pumps) AND (nanoparticles) AND (solid lipid NPS) AND (lipid nanocarriers). Searches were conducted in English databases, including Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Cochrane. Results: At first, 136 studies were extracted, but after removing duplicates, 116 cases remained for further analysis. After evaluating the title and abstract of each study, 95 unrelated studies were excluded. The remaining 25 studies were reviewed based on full texts. Considering the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 19 studies were selected. In this study, metal nanoparticles were the most used nanoparticles for anti-biofilm and efflux pump purposes, and among these nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) contributed the most. Conclusions: The present study shows that nanoparticles have potential and significant effects in inhibiting biofilm and efflux pumps in A. baumannii isolates, which researchers can consider in light of the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. © 2023 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH.

"Background/aim: Surface electromyography (surface EMG) is a primary technique to detect the electrical activities of muscles through surface electrodes. In recent years, surface EMG applications have grown from conventional fields into new fields. However, there is a gap between the progress in the research of surface EMG and its clinical acceptance, characterized by the translational knowledge and skills in the widespread use of surface EMG among the clinician community. To reduce this gap, it is necessary to translate the updated surface EMG applications and technological advances into clinical research. Therefore, we aimed to present a perspective on recent developments in the application of surface EMG and signal processing methods. Materials and methods: We conducted this scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) method. We conducted a general search of PubMed and Web of Science to identify key search terms. Following the search, we uploaded selected articles into Rayyan and removed duplicates. After prescreening 133 titles and abstracts, we assessed 91 full texts according to the inclusion criteria. Results: We concluded that surface EMG has made innovative technological progress and has research potential for routine clinical applications and a wide range of applications, such as neurophysiology, sports and art performances, biofeedback, physical therapy and rehabilitation, assessment of physical exercises, muscle strength, fatigue, posture and postural control, movement analysis, muscle co-ordination, motor synergies, modelling, and more. Novel methods have been applied for surface EMG signals in terms of time domain, frequency domain, time–frequency domain, statistical methods, and nonlinear methods. Conclusion: Translating innovations in surface EMG and signal analysis methods into routine clinical applications can be a helpful tool with a growing and valuable role in muscle activation measurement in clinical practices. Thus, researchers must build many more interfaces that give opportunities for continuing education and research with more contemporary techniques and devices. © TÜBİTAK."
"This study aimed to investigate the public perception of equestrian clothing during the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a big data analysis platform (Sometrend), text mining analysis was used as the study methodology. The phrase subject to analysis was ""equestrian clothing,"" and the analysis period spanned the years 2020 and 2021. Frequency, equestrian clothing, and emotion words were analyzed. The results of the study showed that except for the summer, which includes the Olympic period, there was a considerable rise in equestrian clothing from fall to winter. The referenced word most closely related to equestrian clothing was ""pants."" Positive words about equestrian clothing appeared more than negative words, such as ""suitable,"" ""good,"" and ""pretty."" In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the public's interest in equestrian clothing peaked in the fall and winter, and interest in pants was high. The people also had favorable opinions of the riding clothing fashion. The public will need equestrian clothing with a variety of designs in the future, as well as riding pants appropriate for the fall and winter. This study can provide data for the development of equestrian clothing in the future. © 2023 Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This paper presents a state-of-the-art solution to the LongEval CLEF 2023 Lab Task 2: LongEval-Classification [1]. The goal of this task is to improve and preserve the performance of sentiment analysis models across shorter and longer time periods. Our framework feeds date-prefixed textual inputs to a pre-trained language model, where the timestamp is included in the text. We show date-prefixed samples better conditions model outputs on the temporal context of the respective texts. Moreover, we further boost performance by performing self-labeling on unlabeled data to train a student model. We augment the self-labeling process using a novel augmentation strategy leveraging the date-prefixed formatting of our samples. We demonstrate concrete performance gains on the LongEval-Classification [1] evaluation set over non-augmented self-labeling. Our framework achieves a 2nd place ranking with an overall score of 0.6923 and reports the best Relative Performance Drop (RPD) [2] of -0.0656 over the short evaluation set (see Alkhalifa et al. [3]). © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Recent advances in NLP techniques, the use of large language models and Transformers are showing promising results for processing clinical content. The development of tools for automatic recognition of medical concepts, variables, and clinical expressions is key for the semantic analysis of clinical records, semantic search engines and the generation of structured data representations. Despite the importance of medical procedures for management, diagnosis prevention and prognosis, there are few comprehensive resources for medical procedure extraction and normalization. In order to foster the development of procedure mention detection and entity linking systems, we have released the MedProcNER (Medical Procedures Name Entity Recognition) corpus, a high quality, manually annotated collection of 1000 clinical case reports written in Spanish. The corpus has been exhaustively labeled by physicians following detailed annotation guidelines and quality control measurements. Additionally, a multilingual Silver Standard corpus has also been generated for English, Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Dutch, Swedish and Czech, to provide a clinical NLP resource for research in these languages. A total of 9 teams from 8 different countries have participated in the MedProcNER track of BioASQ 2023 (part of CLEF 2023), using mostly Transformers architectures and models like RoBERTA, BioMBERT, ALBERT, Longformers or SapBERT. MedProcNER was structured into three sub-tracks: a) Clinical Procedure Entity Recognition task, b) Clinical Procedure Normalization task to SNOMED CT and c) Clinical Procedure-based Document Indexing task.

"Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) are essential engineering documents used to design and operate industrial processes. They consist of graphical symbols and text annotations that describe the equipment, piping, and control systems within a process. Text recognition and detection in P&IDs is an important task as it enables automatic information extraction and analysis, which can help improve the efficiency of industrial processes. In this paper, we present a novel approach of text detection and recognition in P&IDs using deep learning techniques. Our proposed method consists of two stages: text detection using the deep learning-based algorithm EAST and text recognition using EasyOCR. We evaluate our approach on a P&IDs dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting and recognizing text from P&IDs. © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death globally. Clinical practice guidelines aimed at improving disease management and positively impacting major cardiac adverse events recommend genetic testing for inherited cardiovascular conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), hereditary amyloidosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); however, little is known about how consistently practitioners order genetic testing for these conditions in routine clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the adoption of guideline-directed genetic testing for patients diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH. Methods: This retrospective cohort study captured real-world evidence of genetic testing from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, procedure codes, and structured text fields of de-identified patient records in the Veradigm Health Insights Ambulatory EHR Research Database linked with insurance claims data. Data analysis was conducted using an automated electronic health record analysis engine. Patient records in the Veradigm database were sourced from more than 250,000 clinicians serving over 170 million patients in outpatient primary care and specialty practice settings in the United States and linked insurance claims data from public and private insurance providers. The primary outcome measure was evidence of genetic testing within six months of condition diagnosis. Results: Between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, 224,641 patients were newly diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH and included in this study. Substantial genetic testing care gaps were identified. Only a small percentage of patients newly diagnosed with DCM (827/101,919; 0.8%), HCM (253/15,507; 1.6%), LQTS (650/56,539; 1.2%), hereditary amyloidosis (62/1,026; 6.0%), or FH (718/49,650; 1.5%) received genetic testing. Conclusions: Genetic testing is underutilized across multiple inherited cardiovascular conditions. This real-world data analysis provides insights into the delivery of genomic healthcare in the United States and suggests genetic testing guidelines are rarely followed in practice. 2023 Longoni, Bhasin, Ward, Lee, Nisson, Bhatt, Rodriguez and Dash."

"Higher education is developing towards the trend of informatization, and the way college students learn financial analysis courses has also undergone essential changes. The traditional classroom teaching mode is too single, the content is boring, it cannot attract students, and the teaching effect is not satisfactory. At the same time, there are many contents covered in the financial analysis course, among which financial texts can help enterprises avoid investment risks and prevent financial fraud. Therefore, colleges and universities adopt a blended teaching model, which combines traditional classroom teaching mode on the basis of constructivist education theory, and uses online teaching platforms to improve teaching quality. In the blended teaching of financial analysis classroom, an improved algorithm is introduced to retain the characteristic word frequency factor of financial texts and reassign the weight of characteristic words. The use of this method can improve the performance of financial text classification, so that teachers can complete the blended teaching of financial analysis courses in a targeted manner. © 2023 IEEE."
"The success of deep learning (DL) techniques has led to their adoption in many fields, including attack investigation, which aims to recover the whole attack story from logged system provenance by analyzing the causality of system objects and subjects. Existing DL-based techniques, e.g., state-of-the-art one ATLAS, follow the design of traditional forensics analysis pipelines. They train a DL model with labeled causal graphs during offline training to learn benign and malicious patterns. During attack investigation, they first convert the log data to causal graphs and leverage the trained DL model to determine if an entity is part of the whole attack chain or not. This design does not fully release the power of DL. Existing works like BERT have demonstrated the superiority of leveraging unsupervised pre-trained models, achieving state-of-the-art results without costly and error-prone data labeling. Prior DL-based attacks investigation has overlooked this opportunity. Moreover, generating and operating the graphs are time-consuming and not necessary. Based on our study, these operations take around 96% of the total analysis time, resulting in low efficiency. In addition, abstracting individual log entries to graph nodes and edges makes the analysis more coarse-grained, leading to inaccurate and unstable results. We argue that log texts provide the same information as causal graphs but are fine-grained and easier to analyze. This paper presents AIRTAG, a novel attack investigation system. It is powered by unsupervised learning with log texts. Instead of training on labeled graphs, AIRTAG leverages unsupervised learning to train a DL model on the log texts. Thus, we do not require the heavyweight and error-prone process of manually labeling logs. During the investigation, the DL model directly takes log files as inputs and predicts entities related to the attack. We evaluated AIRTAG on 19 scenarios, including single-host and multi-host attacks. Our results show the superior efficiency and effectiveness of AIRTAG compared to existing solutions. By removing graph generation and operations, AIRTAG is 2.5x faster than the state-of-the-art method, ATLAS, with 9.0% fewer false positives and 16.5% more true positives on average. © USENIX Security 2023.

"With the popularity of smart devices and online social media platforms, people are expressing their views in various modalities like text, images, and audio. Thus, recent research in sentiment analysis is no more limited to one modality of information only, rather it compiles all the available modalities to predict more correct sentiment. Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is the process of extracting sentiment from various modalities such as text, images, and audio. Existing research works predict the sentiment of individual modalities independently and these predictions leverage the final sentiment. This paper presents an MSA approach for obtaining the final sentiment of an image-text tweet using multimodal decision-level fusion by incorporating features of individual modalities and inter-modal semantic relations. A dataset is prepared from an existing benchmark MSA dataset by annotating the final sentiment to tweets as a whole after assessing all the modalities. The proposed approach is experimented on this dataset and compared with state-of-the-art MSA methods. The in-depth analysis of the comparison results shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, and F1-score. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
The DoSSIER team from the University of Milano Bicocca participated in the Simple Text lab from Clef 2023. We focus on analysing the distribution of topics (or themes) for the content selection task and its potential effects in retrieval. We introduce Domain-knowledge through an ontology with different classification algorithms for annotating documents. This allows us to study the diversity in retrieval results and show how constraining them positively impacts the information-gathering task. We constrain results to concentrate them to specific sets of themes built using pseudo-relevance feedback. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of the educational status of special education schools for the physically disabled by analyzing text data on school goals and school evaluations in special schools for the physically disabled nationwide in South Korea. As a result of analysis, regarding the school goals and school evaluations of 21 special education schools for the physically disabled nationwide, the noun word that appeared most often in the school goals was “Student” and the adjective word was “Healthy.” The verb word was “Develop.” The noun word that appeared most frequently in the school evaluation of curriculum organization and operation was “Student” and the adjective word was “Educational.” The verb word was “Be.” The noun word that appeared most frequently in the school evaluation of the classes was “Student,” and the adjective word was “Various.” The verb word was “Be.” In conclusion, the school goals for physical disabilities were focused on improving the health of students with physical disabilities, and school evaluations appeared to focus on the individual curriculum for students with physical disabilities. In the future, it will be necessary to investigate the current status of special education for students with physical disabilities according to the degree of disability. © 2023 Asian Journal of Human Services,."
"Background: Dietary monitoring is critical to maintaining human health. Social media platforms are widely used for daily recording and communication for individuals’ diets and activities. The textual content shared on social media offers valuable resources for dietary monitoring. Objective: This study aims to describe the development of iFood, an applet providing personal dietary monitoring based on social media content, and validate its usability, which will enable efficient personal dietary monitoring. Methods: The process of the development and validation of iFood is divided into four steps: Diet datasets construction, diet record and analysis, diet monitoring applet design, and diet monitoring applet usability assessment. The diet datasets were constructed with the data collected from Weibo, Meishijie, and diet guidelines, which will be used as the basic knowledge for further model training in the phase of diet record and analysis. Then, the friendly user interface was designed to link users with backend functions. Finally, the applet was deployed as a WeChat applet and 10 users from the Beijing Union Medical College have been recruited to validate the usability of iFood. Results: Three dietary datasets, including User Visual-Textual Dataset, Dietary Information Expansion Dataset, and Diet Recipe Dataset have been constructed. The performance of 4 models for recognizing diet and fusing unimodality data was 40.43%(dictionary-based model), 18.45%(rule-based model), 59.95%(Inception-ResNet-v2), and 51.38% (K-nearest neighbor), respectively. Furthermore, we have designed a user-friendly interface for the iFood applet and conducted a usability assessment, which resulted in an above-average usability score. Conclusions: iFood is effective for managing individual dietary behaviors through its seamless integration with social media data. This study suggests that future products could utilize social media data to promote healthy lifestyles. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Writing style change detection aims to identify the text position where the author switches in multi-author documents for further author identification. This paper introduces our experiment on the shared task of PAN 23. We apply the method of comparative learning in the analysis of writing style and optimize the sentence segment embedding output by the encoder of the pretraining model so that the encoder can obtain more similar vectors in space when processing sentences with similar styles, and expand the distance between the embedding representation of paragraphs with different styles. We use the optimized encoder to generate sentence embeddings by analyzing the tag data combined with paragraph sample pairs and classifying them through a full connection layer. Through experiments, we obtained F1-scores of 0.9145, 0.8203, and 0.6755 on Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 of the official test set, respectively. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"This study aims to adopt existing methodologies to build a Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)-based multimodal analytical framework capable of analysing swearing and its subtitling in their full multimodal context. The proposed framework offers tools to investigate how the communicative meanings of swearing are constructed through the interaction between different elements in different modes, and the effects of the retention and modification of the intermodal relations on subtitled films. This study finds that swearing is constructed multimodally through three metafunctional levels. Although the original swearwords are mostly omitted or changed to be less offensive in the Chinese subtitles, most communicative meanings of swearing can be inferred from the complementary relation between subtitles and the elements in the spoken and mise-en-scène modes. The study concludes that the focus of subtitle translation analysis should not be on what is lost in the target texts but on the contributions of different elements in different modes and their intermodal relations as well as how individual translation techniques work in a multimodal environment. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The construction of a sentiment dictionary is essential for the text sentiment analysis. In this paper, news articles of CGTN were collected as the object of experimental data and pre-processed by removing stopping words and non-emotional words. TF-IDF was used to form a list of likely-to-be sentiment seed words. After determining the word sentiment polarity by human coding which were used as criteria to determine the polarity of other candidate emotion words of the whole texts, researchers used SO-PMI algorithm and finally constructed a customized sentiment dictionary containing 366 words in a specific domain. Experimental results show that the sentiment dictionary was feasible and the method employed in this paper may contribute to the future research on sentiment analysis.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of different entities, and it is a fine-grained sentiment classification task. The advent of pre-trained language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural languages processing tasks, and BERT-based pre-trained language models have been successfully applied to tasks that require a deep understanding of language, such as sentiment classification. However, the previous approaches rely on the semantic relevance of a word with a large range of its context. This may lead to an undesirable result. One aspect will go to focus on another aspect's context and confuse the judgment of the model. Although the best ABSA models have achieved significant performance, they still have problems with robustness. Considering this, we choose DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention), which uses disentangled attention in the calculation of attention score, and pays more attention to the relationship between text content and position. Besides, we propose aspect proximity weights (APW), which are designed for the relative distance between aspects and their context. The aspect proximity weight is a kind of weight designed for the relative distance between aspects and their context. The experimental results on the SemEval2014 dataset and the ARTS dataset show that the DeBERTa combining aspect proximity weights has better performance and robustness compared with other baseline models. © 2023 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation."
"Rapid development in the internet era has made posting and obtaining information easier, leading to a sharp increase in rumour numbers. The images are more deceptive than traditional text rumours, making sources and authenticity hard to verify. Therefore, online rumours combining texts and images are more harmful. Detection of multi-modal rumours has become a new challenge. However, most existing methods are difficult to solve this problem and only adopt the standard concatenation for achieving feature fusion among different modes. Accordingly, the fused rumour features can barely effectively capture complementarity and difference among multi-modal data. This study aimed to propose an end-to-end model, named multi-modal rumour detection using bilinear pooling (BL) and domain adversarial neural networks (BPDANN), which adopts BL for multi-modal feature fusion to complement with the other. Further, the event classification module was designed to remove event-specific features and maintain shared features between events based on domain adversarial neural networks. Two text feature extraction methods and two BL methods were combined in pairs for multi-modal feature fusion to verify the effectiveness of BPDANN. Finally, the evaluation was conducted on two public multi-modal rumour datasets, Weibo and Twitter. The results exhibited that BPDANN outperformed current state-of-the-art methods.

"The article examines approaches to the analysis of adaptation strategies of the population in the Republic of Tuva. The author specifies the problematic area of the research and provides characteristics of the used key concepts and their definitions (adaptation practices, innovative potential, social adaptation, sociocultural sphere). The analysis of published academic texts on the specific features of adaptation processes in the regions is supplemented by a generalization of expert opinions, which included managers and specialists of enterprises and executive authorities of Tuva, researchers and faculty members, journalists and public figures. Interviews with 25 experts were recorded by the author in April-May 2023. The purpose of the article is to identify and classify the opinions of the expert community about the features of adaptation strategies of the people of the Republic of Tuva, as well as to determine the foundations of the study of the development of adaptation processes in the region through the prism of social progress. Adaptive models of behavior are classified as survival models and models of social progress. The frequency of mentions of survival strategies is slightly higher than that of social progress strategies. This is due to the objective circumstances of the socioeconomic conditions in the Republic and correlates with the context of the situation in Tuva. Also, expert assessments of passive adaptation strategies — forced inaction and hope for help from the state and relatives, the build-up of debts — are significantly higher than those of active strategies. The results of the expert survey have shown the prevalence of negative assessments of departure from the Republic over positive ones. In particular, it has been found out that the residents’ practice of leaving Tuva has a number of significant drawbacks consisting in a long period of adaptation to highly urbanized living and working conditions, a severe restructuring of the human body due to prolonged acclimatization, a decrease in social status, loss of some professional skills, narrowing of social contacts, living of the transplanted people through a stressful situation and cultural shock, fall (although temporary) in the level of disposable income, deterioration of social well-being. The following positive consequences of leaving the Republic are highlighted: expansion of opportunities for self-improvement, professional growth, improvement of working conditions, recreation and leisure facilities. The experts have also pointed out that although the departure of residents from the region reduces the burden on the labor market and the social sphere, the leaving of qualified professionals is not desirable from the point of view of the progress of the Republic. © 2023 New Reaearch of Tuva.

"In this paper, our solutions for tasks from the ImageCLEF 2023 Challenge Medical Visual Question Answering for GI Task - MEDVQA-GI [1] are presented. The aim of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task was to generate answers based on the given colonoscopy image and corresponding questions. For this problem, a multilabel classification approach was proposed. The solution included neural network training with the utilization of pretrained encoders used to generate embeddings of image and text. The Visual Question Generation (VQG) task was to generate text questions from a given colonoscopy image and answer. To solve this task, we also applied a multilabel classifier consisting of two pretrained encoders used to create embeddings of images and text. The Visual Location Question Answering (VLQA) task was focused on generating segmentation masks covering the area of abnormality based on a given colonoscopy image and specific question. For this purpose, two separate pretrained semantic segmentation models were fine-tuned. For the VQA task, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 on the test dataset. For the VLQA task an accuracy of 0.95, a Jaccard index of 0.67, and a Dice coefficient of 0.68 were achieved on the test dataset. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"We show that the laws of autocorrelations decay in texts are closely related to applicability limits of language models. Using distributional semantics we empirically demonstrate that autocorrelations of words in texts decay according to a power law. We show that distributional semantics provides coherent autocorrelations decay exponents for texts translated to multiple languages. The autocorrelations decay in generated texts is quantitatively and often qualitatively different from the literary texts. We conclude that language models exhibiting Markovian behavior, including large autoregressive language models, may have limitations when applied to long texts, whether analysis or generation. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"Introduction. The article examines the genre of tea well-wishes in contemporary Kalmyk lyric poetry through the prism of folklore tradition. The fact that the theme has been somewhat understudied from the latter perspective makes the work relevant enough. Goals. The article aims to investigate the folklore aspect in Kalmyk poets’ narratives addressing Kalmyk tea. Materials and methods. The paper analyzes related Kalmyk- and Russian-language poems by contemporary Kalmyk poets representing different generations. The study shall examine a number of folklore genres, such as tea well-wishes, proverbs, sayings, and three-part (ternary) poems. The main methods employed are historical-literary, historical-functional, comparative analysis ones, and that of descriptive poetics. Results. In modern Kalmyk lyric poetry, the mentioned genre is represented by a number of poems dealing with ethnic foods. These are texts in Kalmyk and Russian created by poets of different generations — elderly and young ones. In terms of genre, literary tea well-wishes — like the latter’s folklore analogues — largely tend to synthesize different patterns: these often resemble yöräls (well-wishes) and magtals (praises), sometimes — tea well-wishes proper (Kalm. цәәд тәвх йөрәл) and farewell well-wishes (Kalm. хаалhин йөрәл). Conclusions. Tea well-wishes authored by Kalmyk poets describe offerings to ancestors, deities, as well as treats to guests, which reveals the primacy and undeniable significance of tea in rituals, rites, and hospitality. In the folklore tradition, representative texts addressing Kalmyk tea have been created mainly by elderly and middle-aged poets fluent in mother tongue, familiar with oral folklore, customs, rituals, and beliefs of ancestors. © Khaninova R.

"The complexity of scientific texts often creates a barrier to understanding for non-specialist readers. This barrier inhibits the democratization of knowledge and prevents the wider public from engaging with scientific discourse. We argue that applying artificial intelligence to the tasks of identifying and explaining difficult concepts (Complexity Spotting), and simplifying scientific text, has the potential to democratize access to scientific knowledge. We investigate a range of cutting-edge deep learning models for their efficacy in these tasks. The models are trained and evaluated on a dataset of scientific articles, annotated for complex concepts and their simpler explanations. We present a comparative analysis of the performance of these models, illuminating the strengths and weaknesses of each. Our findings reveal promising avenues for future research and development in the field of automated text simplification, contributing to the broader goal of making scientific knowledge accessible to all. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"This paper presents the results of a textometric analysis carried out on the contents of the volume “Conversations with TeMA 1.2023” which collects, in the form of interviews, the reflections of 17 experts on the topic of spatial planning, through their responses to seven open-ended questions. Textometric analysis enables the systematic extraction of quantitative information from a textual corpus through the identification of words, text segments and conceptual connections that are significant due to their frequency and textual relationships. The analysis provides quantitative and statistical insights into some topics that the TeMA Journal Editorial Board considers essential for the definition of a shared and adequately updated strategy for the advancement of the discipline. The purpose of this analysis, which prescinds from any form of judgements or interpretation on the content of the single answers, is to provide an overview of the opinions collected, highlighting commonalities and focuses that may provide fruitful points for reflection for the evolution of spatial planning. © 2023, FeDOA - Federico II University Press.

"Task 2 of eRisk 2023 shared-tasks challenge at Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) was to focus on the early detection of pathological gambling via sequential text processing over social media conversations. The challenge organizers have released different datasets, consisting of social media posts and questionnaires, for all three tasks. The BioNLP research group at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal (IISERB) participated in task 2 of the challenge and submitted five runs that for five different text mining frameworks. The performance of different text classification frameworks and their effectiveness in detecting signs of pathological gambling are demonstrated in this paper. Several classifiers and feature engineering schemes are combined to build individual frameworks. The features from free text are generated following the bag of words model and transformer based embeddings methods. Subsequently, adaptive boosting, logistic regression, support vector machine, and transformer based classifiers were used to identify the signs of pathological gambling from the social media posts. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the support vector machine and adaptive boosting classifier respectively using the entropy and TF-IDF weighting scheme of the bag of words outperforms the other methods on the training set. Furthermore, the adaptive boosting classifier following TF-IDF-based weighting scheme achieves the best precision score among all other submissions of task 2 of erisk 2023. However, the rest of the frameworks could not achieve reasonable performance which needs to be introspected in future. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Introduction. The article deals with two samples of Tibetan-language jātaka texts traced back to the story of the tigress — from the Jātakamālā or Garland of Birth Stories” (Tib. skyes pa'i rabs kyi rgyud, 4th c. AD) and Sutra of the Wise and the Fool (Tib. ’Dzangs blun zhes bya ba theg pa chen po’i mdo, 5th–7th cc. AD). In the narratives under consideration, the Bodhisattva sacrificed himself to a tigress that suffered from starvation and was unable to feed two cubs of hers. Despite the setup and resolution parts associated with the image of a starving tigress and the Bodhisattva’s deed of ‘giving one’s own body’ (Tib. lus sbyin pa) are identical enough, the narrative constructs at large, main and secondary characters do differ significantly in the two stories. The article analyzes some distinctive aspects of compositional components inherent to the canonical Tibetan original texts, describes the plots proper, and identifies common and differing features. Goals. The paper aims to consider contents of the two stories — Jātaka of the Tigress and [Story] of How Prince Mahasattva Sacrificed His Body to a Tigress (Chapter 2), respectively — arising from the plot archetype of giving one’s own body to a tigress, yield genre affiliations, provide comparative data about characters of the stories. The work employs methods of textual and literary analysis Results. Our analysis of the texts shows the latter differ significantly, and the differences touch upon some aspects, such as belonging to the canonical corpus (which accordingly influences structural patterns), numbers of storylines and images of the main character, composition of characters, etc. The work also examines semantics of the concept ‘generosity’ (Tib. sbyin pa) articulated in the title of the Sutra’s chapter. Conclusions. The plot contents of the analyzed jātaka texts vary essentially but the plot archetype of sacrificing one’s body to a tigress remains unchanged. © Oriental Studies.All rights reserved"
"The abundance of strategic planning documents and the dynamic nature of strategic planning necessitate the evolution of analysis tools. This study aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for analyzing strategic planning documents using electronic data processing tools. The core of the proposed methodology is content analysis with the identification and synthesis of semantic structures. It relies on tools such as a content analyzer, a semantic and syntactic parser for in-depth text analysis, and a semantic mapping tool for condensing information gathered in the preceding stages. Initially, we identified three key structures to uncover value orientations, combinations of measures, and anticipated outcomes embedded in the documents of several regions of the Russian North and South. Subsequently, the tools mentioned were utilized for language pattern identification, definition, and classification. In the following stage, using a word cloud toolkit (semantic map), which factors in word frequency and collocation strength, visual representations were derived from the pre-processed data provided by the strategic planning documents. The analysis and comparison of the regional strategies under study revealed that Northern regions’ strategies are more balanced and comprehensive in terms of their underlying values. However, the language patterns describing measures taken and their outcomes mainly concentrate on employment. In addition, it should be noted that semantic structures concerning the lives of indigenous peoples of the North were not identified in the course of the analysis. These conclusions can be useful for both improving the content of long-term regional development planning documents and stimulating scholarly discussions regarding the essence of the strategic planning process across different government levels. © 2023 Authors.

"Capturing readers’ engagement in fiction is a challenging but important aspect of narrative understanding. In this study, we collected 23 readers’ reactions to 2 short stories through eye tracking, sentence-level annotations, and an overall engagement scale survey. We analyzed the significance of various qualities of the text in predicting how engaging a reader is likely to find it. As enjoyment of fiction is highly contextual, we also investigated individual differences in our data. Furthering our understanding of what captivates readers in fiction will help better inform models used in creative narrative generation and collaborative writing tools.

"The paper is devoted to the consideration of the material world of the story “Detstvo” (“Childhood”) by L. N. Tolstoy. The narration on behalf of the child involves a huge number of objects, filling and organizing the artistic space and time of the work and creating a unique world of the child. The things appear in an unusual form, seen by a child from an unusual angle. The analysis focuses on the things in the story, including clothes, shoes, and objects created by the characters. The “making” of things is found to be their most important feature. Attention is paid to the ambiguity of the evaluation and meaning of things. They are described in such a way as to generate different ways of reading and understanding them. It is in this way that a profound understanding of the child’s world in the story of growing up becomes possible. The multiple meanings of objects, the possibility of using one thing named in the text to introduce the characteristics of different characters, and the connection and opposition of things in the text lead to these objects becoming the starting point for memories and reflections on childhood. They serve as the driving force of the story of growing up, helping to create the leading images and introduce the most important themes and motifs, such as the opposition between the lowly and the sublime, “adult” and “child,” as well as one of the main themes of the story “Detstvo,” i.e., the theme of the death of the mother. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Authorship Verification constitutes an important and essential part in the more general area of authorship analysis. In the age of digital communication, where information traverses the globe at the speed of light, determining the true authorship of a text has become a paramount challenge. From verifying the authenticity of legal documents to investigating plagiarism cases and combating online fraud, the field of authorship verification has emerged as a crucial domain in the realm of textual forensics. The PAN 2023 Authorship Verification [1] challenge focuses on determining whether two different types of texts are written by the same author, specifically when the corresponding model is consuming unseen Authors (open set setup). This paper proposes a Contrastive Learning approach with Siamese architecture, that consists of BERT [2][1] and Bi-LSTM on top of BERT. Additionally, this work proposes the creation of 2 dataset from the original one. One for written language texts and one for oral texts. In this way it would be more helpful for a model to compare-contrasts texts to extract stylistic features. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study is to determine whether mapping the lymphatic drainage and diagnostic excision of lymph nodes from lateral neck compartment is able to detect ultrasound unknown metastases in this compartment early and thus favorably affect the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). BACKGROUND: Lymph node involvement in the lateral neck compartment is seen in 30–60 % of patients with PTC at the time of diagnosis and affects the prognosis of patients in terms of disease recurrence. METHODS: From June 2012 to December 2016, 154 patients with no evidence of lateral nodal involvement on imaging studies were treated with total thyroidectomy and central comparment neck dissection. A volume of 0.2 ml of Patent Blue dye was applied in the upper half of the thyroid gland with subsequent exposure of lymphatic drainage in the lateral compartment and 2–3 sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were removed for frozen section (Group 1). In case of metastatic involvement, a lateral comparment neck dissection was performed. The reference groups were composed of a set of patients without detected lymphatic drainage (Group 2) and a set of patients who underwent lateral compartment neck dissection for preoperatively detected metastases in the lymph nodes (Group 3). The biochemical, structural and overall persistence of the disease at the time of administration of adjuvant radioiodine ablation was evaluated. RESULTS: T he SLN identification rate was 95.45 %. In Group 1, a total of 32 patients had a positive SLN. Out of these, 24 patients had positive SLNs based on the analysis of frozen section, while in 8 patients, the positive diagnosis was confirmed through definitive histology. The comparison of data from the entire followup period in all three groups of patients revealed statistically significant differences in persistence of disease, namely in favor of Group 1. The percentage of reoperations for persistence and recurrence of disease was significantly lowest in Group 1 (2.04 %) compared to Groups 2 and 3 (6.94 % and 45.45 % respectively). CONCLUSION: The method is safe and sensitive for detecting unknown lymph node metastases in the lateral neck compartment, and may facilitate a decision to perform accurate surgical treatment of patients with PTC (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 38).

"Statement of problem: Golden proportion, golden percentage, and recurring esthetic dental (RED) proportion are parameters used in esthetic dentistry. However, a meta-analysis of studies evaluating these parameters in individuals from different countries is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine and compare the golden ratio, golden percentage, and RED ratio values as seen in the maxillary anterior teeth of individuals from different countries. Material and methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to identify English and non-English language articles reporting the golden proportion, golden percentage, and RED proportion. The titles, full text, and abstracts were scanned by 2 investigators independently to identify articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Using a meta-analysis software program, data extracted from each selected study were statistically combined using the random-effects model. Weighted mean differences, 95% confidence intervals, and heterogeneity were calculated for each measurement. Results: The search protocol resulted in a total of 752 articles, but only 26 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. While the sample size varied between 46 and 384 in the 26 analyzed studies, a total of 3786 individuals from 12 countries were evaluated. No similarity was found using the esthetic parameters determined in the populations to which the meta-analysis was applied. Conclusions: Mathematical formulas did not provide consistent results that would allow for their use as a standardized guide for creating natural looking smiles. Rather, dental esthetic ratios should be set based on the racial and ethnic character of a population. © 2023 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry"
"The emergence of ChatGPT has sensitized the general public, including the legal profession, to large language models' (LLMs) potential uses (e.g., document drafting, question answering, and summarization). Although recent studies have shown how well the technology performs in diverse semantic annotation tasks focused on legal texts, an influx of newer, more capable (GPT-4) or cost-effective (GPT-3.5-turbo) models requires another analysis. This paper addresses recent developments in the ability of LLMs to semantically annotate legal texts in zero-shot learning settings. Given the transition to mature generative AI systems, we examine the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo(-16k), comparing it to the previous generation of GPT models, on three legal text annotation tasks involving diverse documents such as adjudicatory opinions, contractual clauses, or statutory provisions. We also compare the models' performance and cost to better understand the trade-offs. We found that the GPT-4 model clearly outperforms the GPT-3.5 models on two of the three tasks. The cost-effective GPT-3.5-turbo matches the performance of the 20× more expensive text-davinci-003 model. While one can annotate multiple data points within a single prompt, the performance degrades as the size of the batch increases. This work provides valuable information relevant for many practical applications (e.g., in contract review) and research projects (e.g., in empirical legal studies). Legal scholars and practicing lawyers alike can leverage these findings to guide their decisions in integrating LLMs in a wide range of workflows involving semantic annotation of legal texts.

"Introduction. It is urgent enough to reveal original features of epic traditions in certain ethnic environments to draw a general epic picture of Central Asian peoples. As is evident, shamanism has given rise to diverse epic and poetic genres. Shamanic and epic texts of Mongols are characterized by identical mythological patterns of world order, unified heavenly pantheons, coherent and synonymous ideas and concepts. Goals. The article aims to identify the functions of a shaman/shamaness in plots of Buryat epic narratives, determine the former’s position and status in the system of images. So, the paper shall analyze epic texts clustering with different local traditions of Cis-Baikal Buryats, delineate images of shamans and shamanesses to consider them in a comparative perspective with the involvement of ethnographic material. Materials and methods. The study employs comparative-historical and contrastive methods as key tools of analysis. It examines Buryat epic texts — both published ones and those contained in archives of the Center of Oriental Manuscripts and Xylographs (IMBTS SB RAS). Results. The paper suggests that in the Buryat epic tradition shamans and shamanesses can be viewed as traditional characters traced back to most archaic beliefs, though their functions in uligers are essentially limited and monotypic. There is a gender division at different levels of the universe: celestial deities of upper realms are represented by male shamans, while only shamanesses exhibit activity in the Middle World (i.e., on the Earth). The functions of male shaman deities are nominal and not that significant for the plot. The status of a shamaness in variants and versions of the Unga Geseriad is quite high: she serves as mediator between Heaven and Earth, defender, assistant and adviser to the main characters, clairvoyant and soothsayer — and performs the classical role of shamans in society. Narratives recorded from shaman taletellers or individuals with extensive expertise in shamanic traditions tend to entrust shamanesses with larger plot development impacts rather than those delivered by mere narrators. However, in other uligers (not included in Geseriad) the shamaness — though endowed with the same functions of a clairvoyant, soothsayer and adviser — is opposed to the main character and supports his enemies. So, such uligers often contain the motif of her physical elimination. As can be seen from the above, in Buryat uligers male shamans are rather passive and nominal characters, while shamanesses do play most active roles. In general, the status of shamanesses in the epic tradition does not quite correlate with the traditionally high status of shamans and shamanesses among Cis-Baikal Buryats. © Oriental Studies.All rights reserved"

"RATIONALE: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a serious acute abdominal disease. AP is often referred to as an unpredictable illness, which can take a mild to severe (fatal) course. AIMS OF THE STUDY: 1) To identify clinical parameters that are significantly related to the clinical course of acute pancreatitis. 2) To compile a scoring system enabling the severity of AP to be predicted when the patient is first admitted to hospital. METHODS: Analysis of available publications and clinical guidance, and retrospective analysis of data on patients hospitalised with AP at our clinic enable us to identify clinical details and laboratory results recorded at the time of patients’ admission to hospital that are related to the subsequent severity of the disease. For the purposes of statistical analysis, the sample of patients was divided into two groups: group A (mild AP, without local or organ complications), group B (moderately severe and severe AP with local and/or organ complications). PATIENT GROUPS AND RESULTS: In total, between 01.01.2013 and 30.06.2022, 312 patients with acute pancreatitis were allocated to the retrospective-prospective study sample. 74 % (231/312) of these patients were allocated to group A and 26 % (81/312) were allocated to group B. Univariate analysis of the data collected on the patient sample identified 5 parameters that are statistically significantly associated with the severity of the clinical course of the disease. Presence of SIRS on admission (A vs B, Odds ratio 10.787, 95% CI 5.09-22.85, p < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus type 2 in case history (A vs B, Odds ratio 7.703, 95% CI 3.04-19.51, p < 0.0001), hypocalcaemia on admission (A vs B, Odds ratio 8.288, 95% CI 3.84-17.88, p < 0.0001), urea concentration?> 8 mmol/l (A vs B, Odds ratio 4.227, 95% CI 1.79-10.00, p = 0.0010) and venous lactate concentration?> 2 mmol/l (A vs B, Odds ratio 3.293, 95% CI 1.59-6.82, p = 0.0013). In order to develop a scoring system, each of these parameters was allocated a points value based on its Odds ratio (OR): presence of SIRS 3 points, hypocalcaemia 3 points, diabetes mellitus type 2 in case history 2 points, urea concentration?> 8 mmol/l 1 point and lactate concentration?> 2 mmol/l 1 point. The authors refer to their scoring system as The Acute Pancreatitis Admission Score (APAS). The accuracy of APAS was modelled for various cut off values. Across the whole sample, we ascertained that an APAS ≥ 4 points predicts moderately severe or severe AP with a sensitivity of 81 % (95% CI: 71 – 89 %) and specificity of 87 % (95 CI: 81 – 91 %). The positive predictive value (PPV) of APAS ≥ 4 is 0.68, while its negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.93 and accuracy 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 – 0.89). CONCLUSION: In this study we identify significant simple clinical and laboratory parameters that are commonly tested as part of an initial examination when admitting a patient with AP to hospital. Having identified these parameters we are able to establish a simple scoring system that is able to predict the severity of the course of AP at the moment of hospitalisation (Tab. 5, Fig. 2, Ref. 27).

"This paper presents our participation in the CLEF2023 CheckThat! Lab [1], focusing on Task 2, which addresses Subjectivity Detection [2]. Distinguishing subjective and objective content is pivotal in numerous natural language processing tasks. Our work delves into the challenges and techniques associated with the binary classification problem of discerning personal opinions from impartial stances in textual data. The task encompasses six languages: Arabic, Dutch, English, German, Italian, and Turkish. We adopt a multilingual approach, merging diverse datasets into a comprehensive dataset to train a multilingual model. Through fine-tuning pre-trained language models and employing sampling techniques to tackle class imbalance, we optimize the model’s performance. Our methodology combines multilingual data aggregation with fine-tuning and class imbalance handling, resulting in a robust subjectivity detection model. By participating in the CheckThat! Lab, we contribute to advancing the understanding of subjectivity detection in different languages, opening avenues for more accurate sentiment analysis and text classification in various applications. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Most of the studies of Sumarokov’s work as a journalist regard the writer as a satirist. In contrast, this article suggests a different perspective on the problem of Sumarokov’s literary legacy. Based on the analysis of the narrative potential of the June issue of “Hardworking Bee”, the study proposes to look at the public activity of Sumarokov the publisher as a special communicative strategy. The journal began to claim the formation of a public sphere, offering its conception of personal and social identity. Sumarokov’s journal became an entirely new institution with its audience, along with literary and scientific societies, secular salons, public theatres, and Masonic lodges. The article contains historical commentary and interpretation of the historical-literary and personal contexts of June 1759. The aim of the article is to study the journal metatext of the June issue of “Hardworking Bee”, to examine the problematics and poetics of the texts published in it. The article uses methods of literary studies: historical-typological, cultural-historical, biographical and comparative-historical. The study demonstrates that Sumarokov’s metatextual narrative realized a new model of cyclization for Russian literature. At the lowest, ordinary level, the reader could remain a profane, and at the highest level the reader the reader is turned into a hermetic wise man. We can conclude that Sumarokov’s journal “Hardworking Bee” stimulated the creation of most monthly editions not only in the Russian 18th century. The article emphasizes the importance of Sumarokov’s experience as a publisher and editor for the evaluation of his creativity in general. © 2023 Vestnik Sankt-Peterburgskogo Universiteta, Yazyk i Literatura.

"In the published article there was an error in Article Type. It was incorrectly submitted as a Review; the correct Article Type is Perspective. The published article did not contain a Data Availability Statement. The correct Data Availability Statement appears below: “Data for the arroyo toad habitat occupancy analysis and R code for the Poisson generalized linear mixed effects model (GLM) and categorical regression analyses can be downloaded from the journal website.” In the published article, there were several errors in the Supplementary Material. The original data for the arroyo toad habitat occupancy analyses was omitted. The missing material appears below: “To further evaluate the relationship between the non-native species index (NNI) and beaver dam presence, we performed two sets of analyses using Bayesian multilevel models in the R package brms (Bürkner 2017). First, we fit a Poisson generalized linear mixed effects model (GLM), which included a fixed intercept, fixed effect of beaver presence, and a random effect for year to account for repeated measures (Duarte et al., 2018). We evaluated model fit by ensuring that all model parameters had Gelman-Rubin values <1.1, by visually inspecting the posterior samples for convergence, and by generating posterior predictive plots to measure within-sample predictive performance. We specified default priors and ran the model across 4 chains for 2000 iterations, with a warmup of 1000 iterations, and a thinning rate of 1, totaling 4000 post-warmup samples. This model showed that the estimated NNI was nearly three times greater (mean = 2.9; 95%CI = 2.1–3.9) at sites where dams were present (mean = 1.9, 95%CI = 1.3–2.6) compared to sites where they were absent yet still contained water (mean = 0.7, 95%CI= 0.5–0.8). We also performed a categorical regression treating NNI as a discrete state variable (Congdon 2005), with NNI modeled as a function of an intercept and beaver dam presence. We included year as a random effect, and specified default priors for the intercepts at each NNI level and the effect of beaver dams on NNI. We evaluated model fit and performed the analysis using the same run specifications as described above. Default priors used for these analyses are viewable in the model object after it is run in R. This analysis confirmed that a higher NNI score was more probable when a beaver dam was present (Figure 2B, main text). The data used to perform the occupancy analysis (Supplemental Data.xlsx) and R code for running the Poisson GLM and categorical regression (Supplemental R code.pdf) are downloadable form the journal website.

Fitting N-mixture models to count data with unmodeled heterogeneity: Bias, diagnostics, and alternative approaches. Ecol. Model. 374, 51–59.” It was also discovered that (1) a beaver dam recorded in 2004 was inadvertently not included in the dataset, and that (2) removal of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) from the non-native index (NNI) in the 2013–2018 dataset (due to its ubiquity across the survey area) was not applied to the 2003–2012 dataset. This led to an NNI ranging from 0 to 3 in the 2013–2018 dataset and 0 to 4 in the 2003-2012 dataset. To correct the discrepancy in the combined dataset and test for any effect on our conclusions in the published article, we removed mosquitofish from the NNI across all years and reran the occupancy models in Presence, then re-analyzed the correlation between beaver dam presence and NNI using a Spearman rank test for averaged annual covariate values across sites. There was a statement in Supplementary Material, Arroyo toad field Surveys and data analysis, paragraph three, that required clarification about the use of correlated variables. The corrected statement appears below: “To reduce model complexity, we initially removed correlated variables by category (water, aquatic vegetation, etc.; Table S1) based on Pearson and Spearman rank tests (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 and r/ρ > 0.25; Bonett and Wright 2000). If certain correlated variables were of particular interest (e.g., NNI score, specific non-native taxa, etc.), we tested them in separate models.” Lastly, there was labeling error in Supplementary Table S1 involving the covariate “Hydroperiod (current year & previous year)”. It previously stated: The clarification appears below: In the published article, as a result of re-analysis of the arroyo toad occupancy data as described above, changes were required to Figure 2. The corrected Figure 2 and its caption appear below. (A) Effect of the non-native aquatic species index (NNI: the number of non-native aquatic species observed at a site, ranging from 0-3 and consisting of American bullfrog, red swamp crayfish, and or large predatory fish [e.g., Micropterus sp., treated as a single species]) on the probability of occupancy, colonization, and local extinction of arroyo toad in coastal San Diego county from 2003–2018. (B) Results of the categorical regression showing the probability of the NNI score relative to beaver dam presence/absence (error bars represent the upper 95% credible intervals of the posterior probability distributions: see Supplemental File for further details). In the published article, as a result of re-analysis of the arroyo toad occupancy data, it was necessary to correct Native Fauna and Flora Under Threat, Arroyo Toad, paragraph one. The text previously stated: “The presence of a beaver dam was also a significant predictor of extirpation, with the probability of local extinction being 2.5 (95% CI 0.9–3.4) times higher when a dam was present. The probability of extinction grew to nearly 0.70 when a beaver dam and all three non-native species were present, nearly seven times higher than in reaches without any invasive species (Figure 2).” The corrected sentence appears below: “(Figure 2A). Data averaged across years further showed that a non-native species index (NNI: the number of non-native aquatic species recorded at a site, ranging from 0-3 and consisting of American bullfrog, red swamp crayfish, and or large predatory fish [e.g., Micropterus sp., treated as a single species]) and beaver dam presence were significantly correlated (Spearman’s ρ = 0.62, P < 0.001). The presence of a beaver dam also increased the probability of a higher NNI score, with the estimated NNI being nearly three times greater (mean = 2.9; 95% credible interval = 2.1-3.9) at sites where beaver dams were present versus sites where they were absent yet still contained water (See Supplemental File for further details). Thus, beaver dams were not only a top predictor of occupancy dynamics in the arroyo toad, their presence was also associated with increased richness of non-native aquatic predators.” In the published article, Effects of novel ecological disturbance on native fauna and flora, paragraph six.

"Background.Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain in adults, wherein half of the cases is coupled to a neuropathic component.Agents with chondroprotective properties such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glucosamine sulfate (GS) have been successfully used in the treatment of OA-related pain.CS/GS exhibit diverse analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and chondroregenerative effects that contribute to the restoration of cartilage tissue.Objective: to analyze the misconceptions associated with the medical terminology used for CS/HS in the treatment of OA-related pain, approaches to standardize the quantitative and qualitative composition of CS/HS extracts.Material and methods.Expert analysis was performed along with computational linguistics methods (sentiment analysis, i.e.analysis of text-related emotional modality).Sentiment analysis was carried out using the topological theory of data analysis and algorithms, with 90% accuracy allowing to classify texts into 16 classes of sentiment (manipulative constructs, research without positive results, propaganda, data falsification, etc.).This technique was tested earlier on 20 million publications retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE database.Results.In recent years, the use of highly dubious terms such as “symptomatic slow acting drug for osteoarthritis, SYSADOA”, etc., has been extensively promoted at certain international conferences.The introduction of such barely scientific terms is not justified neither by the results of basic research nor clinical practice.Using the methods of computational linguistics and data mining of the biomedical literature, we have shown that some misconceptions actively promoted at the so-called ""grand conferences"" and ""international congresses"" virtually lack in real-world published scientific literature.Such misconceptions, logically contradicting the entire system of other medical terms, confuse scientific terminology.Moreover, texts promoting this misconceptions are easily recognized as manipulative not only by experts in the analysis of medical literature, but also by artificial intelligence algorithms.Conclusion.A number of misconceptions associated with inadequate interpretation of data obtained during basic and clinical studies of CS/GS has been explored.Specific examples show how practitioners can distinguish between manipulative propaganda and a balanced presentation of research data. © 2019 Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences."
"The popularity of large-scale dialogue systems such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Bixby has grown considerably in recent years. However, these systems often make errors in domain and intent classification, resulting in incorrect responses and a suboptimal user experience. In this paper, we propose a solution that utilizes unsupervised data augmentation for consistency training (UDACT) to analyze virtual assistant's user logs and identify instances where the system has misclassified the user's intended domain or intent. We also analyze the characteristics of various domains, considering factors such as noise, simplicity, diversity, complexity, density and sparsity, and apply augmentation techniques accordingly to improve the system's performance. Our solution also generates a report that highlights instances of misclassification and provides insights for the types of errors that the system is making. We conduct empirical analysis by comparing the suitability & performance with various state-of-the-art methods. Currently, our solution has achieved an accuracy of 92.4% on our In-House dataset that comprises of 30 domains and more than 300 intents and an accuracy of 98.2% on standard SNIPS-MultiWOZ2.2 dataset that comprises of 14 domains and 37 intents. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution on virtual assistant's multi-domain user logs, showing its ability to identify misclassifications in large scale dialogue systems.  © 2023 IEEE."
"We investigate native language identification (LangID) for Brazilian Indigenous Languages (BILs), using the Bible as training data. Our research extends from previous work, by presenting two analyses on the generalization of Bible-based LangID in non-biblical data. First, with newly collected non-biblical datasets, we show that such a LangID can still provide quite reasonable accuracy in languages for which there are more established writing standards, such as Guarani Mbya and Kaigang, but there can be a quite drastic drop in accuracy depending on the language. Then, we applied the LangID on a large set of texts, about 13M sentences from the Portuguese Wikipedia, towards understanding the difficulty factors may come out of such task in practice. The main outcome is that the lack of handling other American indigenous languages can affect considerably the precision for BILs, suggesting the need of a joint effort with related languages from the Americas. ©2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The paper presents an approach to named entity oriented sentiment analysis of Russian news texts proposed during the RuSentNE evaluation. The approach is based on RuRoBERTa-large, a pre-trained RoBERTa model for Russian. We compared several types of entity representation in the input text, and evaluated strategies for handling class imbalance and resampling entity tags in the training set. We demonstrated that some strategies improve the results of pre-trained models obtained on the dataset presented by the organizers of the evaluation. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"This paper describes a submission to the EXIST 2023 challenge for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification tasks, targeting the detection of sexism in English and Spanish tweets. Our approach employs a cross-lingual transformer model for these tasks, with a specific emphasis on ""discrete"" (hard-label) classification. Through a comparative analysis with other transformer-based models, our final model demonstrates effectiveness of the cross-lingual transformer models in achieving competitive performance. Notably, our model also achieves favorable rankings in hard-labeling for all the tasks. These results underscore the potential of cross-lingual models in accurately classifying English and Spanish text data without relying on language-specific models. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"The article is devoted to reconstructing the social context of the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth, one of the most prominent 12th-century English historical writers. For this, a corpus of documents is analyzed, in which Geoffrey himself and his probable patrons appear, as well as the textual history of the historian’s writings, primarily the “On the deeds of the Britons”. This analysis make it possible to put forward a number of conclusions. Geoffrey himself most likely belonged to a family of Breton immigrants to England, although there is no direct evidence of this. Geoffrey’s patron in the 1130s and the 1140s, Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, was part of the entourage of the Anglo-Breton baron Brian Fitz-Count, court knight of King Henry I, and later one of the leading supporters of his daughter, Empress Matilda. It is most likely that it was through Brian that Walter and Geoffrey got in touch with Robert, Earl of Gloucester, Empress Matilda’s brother and dedicatee of the original version of the “On the deeds of the Britons”. Perhaps it was through Brian and his wife Matilda that a copy of Geoffrey’s book came to the Norman Abbey of Bec, where it was found in January 1139 by another English historian, Henry of Huntingdon. Around 1141, possibly due to the failures of the ‘Angevin’ party and Brian personally, Archdeacon Walter began to establish contacts with King Stephen’s supporters, including with representatives of the Beaumont family, one of whom, Count Waleran, became the dedicatee of a slightly revised version of the ‘On the deeds of the Britons’. © 2023 Russian State University for the Humanities"

"Many banking companies use a chatbot that can answer questions about their products. Knowing the sentiments of users can help companies evaluate the chatbots. However, the chatbot is made using a decision dialogue method so it has no knowledge of the sentiment of a sentence. Traditional data mining methods such as converting words to vectors are no longer efficient because of the limited representation of sentences. Therefore, we need a method that can connect words between words so that the model can understand it better, namely using graph-based representation. We represent a graph with words as nodes along with their node properties in the form of vectors and edges using a dependency parser to connect these nodes. With graphs we can represent text better such as being able to include the part of speech of the word, the number of letters, and so on. Data that has been converted to graph will be processed with a graph-based model. In this study, we compare traditional methods with graph-based methods in terms of the performance and inference time in detecting the sentiment of a sentence. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the graph-based model achieves a comparable level of accuracy (0.7173) to that of the tree-based model. However, when it comes to inference time, the graph-based models outperform the tree-based models, being three times faster.  © 2023 IEEE."

"In this paper, a random forest model is built using movie lines, each regression tree's prediction values are aggregated, and the final average is used as the prediction result. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation decision is taken, and it is based on the fuzzy transformation principle and the maximum affiliation principle. The single-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can effectively cope with various fuzzy and uncertain information, which makes the comprehensive evaluation results more stable and reliable. The research results show that the training accuracy of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is 96% and the testing accuracy is as high as 97%, and the proposed research can provide new ideas and research methods for the fields of film linguistics and text analysis.  © 2023 Fang Chen, published by Sciendo 2023."
"The article examines the study of poetics of the short life (vita) of John of the Ladder, compiled by Daniel of Raifa. The text analysis is carried out on the material of the Russian translation of The Optina Pustyn Monastery. The life is an integral part of the creation of John the Sinai the Ladder. The author of article focuses on the topos of ladder, its semantic content, forms of expression and its function in the structure of the life (vita). The essential nexus of the life of the saint with his own creation determines the principle of comparison of the texts. The image of St. John of the Ladder is in the centre, as in the icon, organizing all the elements of poetics, including the topos of ladder. The ladder contains 30 steps (or “degrees”), which are reflected in the life (vita), but not in direct sequence, but in subordination to the law of iconicity and the basic principle of creating a hagiographic image — the reverse perspective. The main thing in the life (vita) is the space of Divine eternity, and for the hagiographer it is not the temporal progression of external or even internal events that is important, but hierarchy of virtues and its expression in the image of the saint whose example is to be followed. The panegyric nature of the life determines its metaphoricity, imagery, which allows the hagiographer to express briefly the main idea of the Ladder — ascent of the saint along the steps of virtues. © 2023, Lyudmila G.

"This fifth supplement to the Corpus of Roman Inscriptions of Verona and its territory contains both unpublished texts and new readings of already known inscriptions. The first contribution analyses a previously unknown stele preserved in the Archaeological Museum at the Roman Theatre; this monument bears a dedication to a woman, Cornelia Salvia, freedwoman of her companion M. Cornelius Favor. The second contribution examines an inscribed fragment known to Theodor Mommsen only through the manuscript tradition (CIL, V, 3838), the reading of which can now be improved through autopsy. The third contribution concerns a new fragment of a fu-nerary inscription walled up outside the church of San Zeno in Oratorio which bears the indication of a pedatura. In the following two notes, one can respectively find the re-edition of CIL, V, 3796, a fragment known to Mommsen only through the antiquarian tradition, and the discovery of a new fragment in the church of Ognissanti in Marzana, which completes another fragment bearing the name of a freedwoman reused in the same church (SI 640). The sixth contribution deals with two fragments of funerary stelae preserved in the Archaeological Museum at the Roman Theatre. The last contribution examines two fragments of architrave reused in the church of San Fidenzio in Novaglie (CIL, V, 3698 and AE 2005, 627), published separately but actually belonging to the same funerary monument which M. Servilius Messius made for himself and his family. © 2023, Documentation Center for the History of Valpolicella. All rights reserved."
"The text presents the results of research on the Lisbon musician António Augusto Urceira, in relation to his biographical data and his musical career. As regards his artistic career, interpretation of the data showed plurality to be the best way of describing his activity, which is set out in chronological order – from the end of the Monarchy to the arrival of the Republic, and ending in the Estado Novo. By way of conclusion, we come to recognise that his work with the classical guitar was the best documented and, through an analysis, we perceive how innovative the repertoires that he chose and his performance were for the first half of the 20th century.

"Topic modeling is an important and interesting research area that can assist in discovering patterns and underlying themes in large datasets. This research aims to identify commonly used topics in previous undergraduate thesis research through text mining using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as the topic modeling method. The study utilizes abstracts as the primary source to identify the content of the research documents accurately and quickly. We collected a dataset of 666 abstract theses and utilized LDA to identify the dominant themes and topics within the corpus. Our results indicate that the LDA model achieved a coherence score of up to 0.448, indicating a reasonable level of coherence in the identified topics. We identified six main topics within the dataset, including system analysis and design, data mining, computer networks, decision support systems, software testing, and computer security. The result of this study is expected to serve as a useful reference for students and thesis supervisors in selecting future thesis topics and identifying novel and underexplored topics.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (nTOS) is a rare pathology caused by dynamic conditions or compression of neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet region. nTOS can be difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are increasingly used to aid the diagnosis and surgical planning. This scoping systematic review explores how MRI is used for diagnosing nTOS and summarizes details of published MRI protocols. Methods: A systematic screening of PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases using PRISMA-IPD guidelines was conducted in September 2022 to include full-text English papers on MRI and nTOS. Inclusion criteria involved studies describing MRI protocols for the diagnosis of TOS, with a focus on the imaging sequences and protocols. Results: 6289 papers were screened to include 28 papers containing details of MRI protocols. The details of MRI protocols in the analyzed articles were incomplete in all studies. Most authors used 1.5T systems and included T1 and T2-weighted sequences. Most studies applied fat suppression, mainly with STIR. Positioning of the arm differed between studies, including neutral, hyperabducted and abducted and externally rotated positions. Conclusion: Our review highlights a prevalent lack of detailed MRI protocol documentation for brachial plexus. Authors primarily rely on conventional 1.5T systems, employing standard T1 and T2-weighted sequences. The adoption of novel MRI sequences is notably lacking, and fat suppression techniques predominantly adhere to older methods as STIR. There is a clear imperative for authors to provide more comprehensive reporting of the MRI protocols utilized in their studies, ultimately enhancing comparability and clinical applicability. Establishing clear protocol reporting guidelines is crucial to allow for comparison between studies. Copyright © 2023 Szaro, Suresh, Molokwu, Sibala, Mendiratta, Chu and McGrath."
"Thromboembolic events are common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be related to a prothrombotic state. Several clinical trials evaluating different anticoagulation strategies were developed. Thus, we proposed conducting a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos for studies published until December 22, 2022. Nine studies compared prophylactic/intermediate anticoagulation versus therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins were included. Four efficacy and one safety endpoints were analyzed: all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events, pulmonary embolism, need of intensive care unit or non-invasive ventilation, and major bleeding. Compared with prophylactic/intermediate anticoagulation, therapeutic anticoagulation with heparins was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and need of intensive care unit or non-invasive ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but showed a reduction in the number of thromboembolic events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41–0.71, I2 = 0 %) and pulmonary embolisms (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24–0.57, I2 = 0 %), besides an increase in major bleeding (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.05–2.64, I2 = 0 %). This meta-analysis did not show a reduction in all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received anticoagulation with heparin at a therapeutic dose compared to those who received a prophylactic/intermediate dose, as well as no significant differences were found in the need of intensive care unit admission or use of non-invasive ventilation. There was, however, a reduction in thromboembolic events, pulmonary embolism, and increased bleeding (Tab. 1, Fig. 5, Ref. 31). Text in PDF www.elis.sk © (2023). All rights reserved."

"This paper first investigates the expressive features and developmental commonalities of Chinese modern and contemporary literary works, explains the paradoxical nature, and there are dilemmas in the expressive features by reviewing the data, and proposes the nationalized literary model and the cosmopolitan literary model, aiming to promote the development of Chinese modern and contemporary literature. Then, based on text mining techniques, atomic cuts are performed in the lowest fifth layer using Hidden Markov Models, and rough Chinese word splitting is performed using the n-shortest path method to find out the most likely n ambiguous word splitting results and text clustering analysis based on HMM-LDA topic models is performed on top of the splitting results. The results show that the HMM-LDA text recognition model is more accurate than the HMM text recognition model in terms of recall and accuracy of entity recognition in five categories of Chinese modern and contemporary literature: poetry, prose, drama, novel, and picture. Through this study, people gain a deeper understanding of modern and contemporary literature, gain some insight, and establish a foundation for promoting modern and contemporary literature.  © 2023 Xianghui Zhang, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Children’s picturebooks have a unique potential to support young children with learning disabilities, to allow them to see themselves reflected in the stories, to educate others around them about their experiences and their needs, and to better represent the diversity of learners. Are today’s picturebooks that portray characters with learning disabilities harnessing this potential by providing a diversity of multi-dimensional characters that readers can connect with? Through the lens of radical change theory, this study uses content analysis to examine the text and illustrations of 14 recent picturebooks that portray characters with learning disabilities to assess the trends, themes, and strengths of modern children’s literature. Fourteen children’s picturebooks for children ages 4 to 8 published between 2010 and March 2022 were selected, with a special effort to find books featuring characters with dysgraphia and dyscalculia, but also including characters with other learning disabilities. The books were closely read and the illustrations examined to find dominant themes and evidence of radical change—elements of changing forms and formats, changing perspective, and changing boundaries. Findings include an increase in the diversity of families portrayed, new perspectives of youth voices and youth authors, and more multi-dimensional, strength-based portrayals of characters. However, there is still a need for more diversity of ethnicities and ethno-centric storytelling and representation of learning disabilities other than dyslexia, including dyscalculia and dysgraphia. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Predicting the perception of literary quality and reader appreciation of narrative texts are highly complex challenges in quantitative and computational literary studies due to the fluid definitions of quality and the vast feature space that can be considered when modeling a literary work. This paper investigates the potential of sentiment arcs combined with topical-semantic profiling of literary narratives as indicators for their literary quality. Our experiments focus on a large corpus of 19th and 20the century English language literary fiction, using GoodReads’ ratings as an imperfect approximation of the diverse range of reader evaluations and preferences. By leveraging a stacked ensemble of regression models, we achieve a promising performance in predicting average readers’ scores, indicating the potential of our approach in modeling perceived literary quality. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Coreference resolution is an important task in natural language processing, since it can be applied to such vital tasks as information retrieval, text summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis and machine translation. In this paper, we present a study on the effectiveness of several approaches to coreference resolution, focusing on the RuCoCo dataset as well as results of participation in the Dialogue Evaluation 2023. We explore ways to increase the dataset size by using pseudo-labelling and data translated from another language. Using such technics we managed to triple the size of dataset, make it more diverse and improve performance of autoregressive structured prediction (ASP) on coreference resolution task. This approach allowed us to achieve the best results on RuCoCo private test with increase of F1-score by 1.8, Precision by 0.5 and Recall by 3.0 points compared to the second-best leaderboard score. Our results demonstrate the potential of the ASP model and the importance of utilizing diverse training data for coreference resolution. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and interaction, as well as rigid and unchanging interests and behaviors. Several studies have reported that activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative pathways are accompanied by depletion of plasma tryptophan (TRP), increased competing amino acid (CAAs) levels, and activation of the TRP catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze data on peripheral TRP, CAAs, TRYCAT pathway activity, and individual TRYCATs, including kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KA) levels, in the blood and urine of ASD patients. After extensively searching PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciFinder, a total of 25 full-text papers were included in the analysis, with a total of 6653 participants (3557 people with ASD and 3096 healthy controls). Our results indicate that blood TRP and the TRP/CAAs ratio were not significantly different between ASD patients and controls (standardized mean difference, SMD = −0.227, 95% confidence interval, CI: −0.540; 0.085, and SMD = 0.158, 95% CI: −0.042; 0.359), respectively. The KYN/TRP ratio showed no significant difference between ASD and controls (SMD = 0.001, 95% CI: −0.169; 0.171). Blood KYN and KA levels were not significantly changed in ASD. Moreover, there were no significant differences in urine TRP, KYN, and KA levels between ASD and controls. We could not establish increases in neurotoxic TRYCATs in ASD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates no abnormalities in peripheral blood TRP metabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) activity, or TRYCAT production in ASD. Reduced TRP availability and elevated neurotoxic TRYCAT levels are not substantial contributors to ASD's pathophysiology. © 2023 International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"We argue that dialect identification should be treated as a multi-label classification problem rather than the single-class setting prevalent in existing collections and evaluations. In order to avoid extensive human re-labelling of the data, we propose an analysis of ambiguous near-duplicates in an existing collection covering four variants of French. We show how this analysis helps us provide multiple labels for a significant subset of the original data, therefore enriching the annotation with minimal human intervention. The resulting data can then be used to train dialect identifiers in a multi-label setting. Experimental results show that on the enriched dataset, the multi-label classifier produces similar accuracy to the single-label classifier on test cases that are unambiguous (single label), but it increases the macro-averaged F1-score by 0.225 absolute (71% relative gain) on ambiguous texts with multiple labels. On the original data, gains on the ambiguous test cases are smaller but still considerable (+0.077 absolute, 20% relative gain), and accuracy on non-ambiguous test cases is again similar in this case. This supports our thesis that modelling dialect identification as a multi-label problem potentially has a positive impact. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In this paper, we report on our writing style change detection system which is used for the PAN task of Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis. To detect the writing style change within texts, a method based on an encoded classifier using knowledge distillation is proposed. The method proposed in this paper consists of two parts: A neural classifier based on an encoder of a pre-trained language model is used to extract the features of texts and make the writing style change detection. And the knowledge distillation method based on the teacher-student architecture is used for model compression. We evaluate our methods on three tasks with different difficulties on the metrics for F1 score. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Introduction. In the Kalmyk folktale tradition, AT type 508 (The Grateful Dead) develops through the motif of miraculous helper. The analysis shows that the main character pays some debt of the deceased one — to acquire an assistant. Goals. The study examines the motif of assistant in Kalmyk folktales clustering with AT type 508 (The Grateful Dead). Materials. The paper analyzes folktale texts published in Clear Script (Kalm. todo bičiq), Roman characters, and modern Kalmyk Cyrillic. Results. Before a long journey, the hero offers his servant to partake of some food which is a test for the latter: any refusal from the viands of humans shall indicate the companion belongs to the spirit world. The magic nature of the hero’s assistant is also manifested through his abilities to move at extremely high speed and understand the language of animals. And it is due to the latter gift that the assistant hears a dog and a cat’s conversation — to prompt the young man a remedy for the Khan’s daughter. Cat bile acts as medicine in all versions of Kalmyk folktales related to the type ‘Grateful Dead’. A. Afanasyev notes bile serves as medicine for the resurrection and eyesight recovery in the Russian fairy tale ‘Yeruslan Lazarevich’, emphasizing the ‘linguistic and mythical connection’ between — sunshine, glitter of gold, and the yellow color of bile. Being aware of the trouble, the grateful dead person protects his savior and the latter’s spouse from the snake venom. When accused of encroachments, he confesses all his good deeds (massacre of seven cannibal demons, their daughters, wives, and the former’s old mother) and sets outs towards the world of the dead ruled by Erlik Nomin Khan. The hero decides not to leave his assistant and follows him up to hell. Kalmyk folktales of the mentioned type are distinguished by description of trials experienced by the main character and his assistant in the realms of the dead. Possessions of Erlik Nomin Khan — the lord of the dead — are depicted in accordance with ideas of Buddhist hell traced in Oirat written monuments, such as The Story of Chojid-Dagini, The Tale of Molon-Toyin, The Tale of the Goose-Lama, The Tale of Naranu Gerel etc. It is the descriptions of Buddhist hell that distinguish the international type ‘Grateful Dead’ in the Kalmyk oral tradition through the motif of miraculous helper. Conclusions. The motif of helper in the considered folktales unfolds on the basis of traditional ideas with that earlier views were replaced by later Buddhist ones. © Oriental Studies.All rights reserved"
"The article presents an analysis of the image of the horse in Tuvan riddles. The study material consists of 94 riddles selected using the continuous sampling method from the book entitled “Tuvan Riddles” (“Tyva Tyvyzyktar”, compiled by Georgy N. Kurbatskii), which was published in 2018. It is shown that in Tuvan riddles the age and gender terms that are used to name horses (askyr ‘stallion’, aъt ‘steed, horse, gelding’, bogba ‘yearling’, be ‘mare’, kulun ‘foal’, chavaa ‘yearling’), their coat colors and types of gait serve to create original images of other animals, birds, insects, natural phenomena, elements of water and fire, household items, the traditional dwelling of nomads (yurts), technical devices, means of transportation. The author also considers the interrelation between riddles and myths, which is reflected in the texts of Tuvan riddles. The types of tropes often found in Tuvan riddles are noted: metaphors, metaphorical epithets and synecdoche. In addition to traditional riddles, the Tuvans have other riddles that were created in Soviet times. They comprise an airplane, a bicycle, a tractor, a cart that are depicted using the image of a horse. These riddles should be correctly considered as pseudo-paroemias. © 2023 New Reaearch of Tuva.

"Social service documents, such as ”The rules of supervised exchange”, can be difficult to understand because of the language and terms used in them. One way to make these documents more accessible is transforming them into comic contracts. Using a comic-style format, can help clients better understand the document and the associated agency of the worker and the client. Addition-ally, it can make communication by public authorities more accessible. Transforming social service documents involves visualization, i.e., including different types of visual elements in the document. Typically, comic contracts include characters and their interaction is visu-ally displayed. Thus, comic contracts are multimodal texts that combine images and words in different ways. Examining comic contracts in social services is important for both clients and workers. Documents should be understand-able and clear so that clients know what services are described in the documents, what are the clients’ rights, responsibilities, and obligations, and what is expected of them as actors. This article analyzes a multimodal document about ”Rules of supervised exchange”. This document was translated into a comic-style format due to the needs of the Finnish Federation of Mother and Child Homes and Shelters. The federation organizes professionally supervised exchanges and meeting place activities at different sites in Finland, to help children and families in insecure situations. A supervised exchange means that one parent takes the child into a professionally monitored facility, and the other parent picks up the child. The parents arrive and leave the facility at different times, and the supervisor escorts the child from one parent to another to ensure that the parents do not see each other. The aim of the service is to facilitate child exchange in a safe, neutral, and child-centered setting. ”The rules of supervised exchange"" comic contract illustrates how the exchange happens, what is allowed, what is not allowed at the exchange facility, and what should be done if one of the parties is late for the exchange. The research question for this article are as follows: what kind of multi-modal genre does the ”Rules of Supervised Exchange” comic contract belong to? What sections does it consist of? How does it build agency for the client and worker through visual and verbal means? The data will be analyzed using text analysis, period analysis, and the concepts of systemic-functional theory and narratology of comics to interpret the data, with a specific focus on interpreting agency. Through content analysis, we identified three sections in the document: institutional action context and actors’ agency, supervised exchanges and its practices, and regulation of actions and the rights and obligations of actors. These section differ from one another in their objectives, the language used, and visualization, as well as the agency attributed to the actors. The purpose of the ”Rules of supervised Exchange” comic contract is to safeguard the best interests of the child and their right to visit the parents. The agencies of the worker, parents, and child appear to be multidimensional. The analysis indicates that translation is a process that involves making choices in the selection of illustrations and words, as well as in the use of different symbols and characters. Choices are also made for the kind of agencies given to the parents, children, and workers in the document. © 2023, Estonian Association Applied Linguists. All rights reserved."
This paper describes methods for sentiment analysis targeted toward named entities in Russian news texts. These methods are proposed as a solution for the Dialogue Evaluation 2023 competition in the RuSentNE shared task. This article presents two types of neural network models for multi-class classification. The first model is a recurrent neural network model with an attention mechanism and word vector representation extracted from language models. The second model is a neural network model for text2text generation. High accuracy is demonstrated by the generative model fine-tuned on the competition dataset and CABSAR open dataset. The proposed solution achieves 59.33 over two sentiment classes and 68.71 for three-class classification by f1-macro. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved.
"The article examines the poetic text Kolyada for Little Children, which is written in a “prosta mova” (language of Lithuanian Rus’) and is in the convolute of the 17th–18th Centuries from the collection of manuscripts by T.F. Bolshakov (RSL, f. 37, no. 23). The verses belong to a group of works in which a rod is praised and the practice of physical punishment of children is approved. According to the article’s author, the source of all the texts are Polish verses 17th century on a rod, one of the versions of which came as part of the Polish textbook Elementa Pverilis Institutionis edited in 1736. By comparative analysis, it was found that Kolyada for Liittle Children is a literal translation of the Polish text, contains a significant number of polonisms and evidence of misunderstanding by the translator of some Polish words. The fact distinguishes the work from the verses on a rod in the Russian educational literature of the 17th–18th centuries (Simeon Polotsky’s ABC-book, alphabet books of the 17th century), in which there aren’t any polonisms and translation errors, changes have been made to the order of words, lines, rhymes, there are elements indicating cultural adaptation. In the convolute (RSL, f. 37, no. 23) Kolyada for Little Children is in the context of moral works, united with them by the theme of vices and their destructive consequences for human personality. In the collection the verses are functionally connected with subsequent text — the Legend of Literacy, since both texts could be used for educational purposes. © 2023, Natalia A. Demicheva."
"Due to the rapid expansion of information and online sources, automatic keyphrase extraction remains an important and challenging problem in the field of current study. The use of keyphrases is extremely beneficial for many tasks, including information retrieval (IR) systems and natural language processing (NLP). It is essential to extract the features of those keyphrases for extracting the most significant keyphrases as well as summarizing the texts to the highest standard. In order to analyze the distance between keyphrases in news articles as a feature of keyphrases, this research proposed a region-based unsupervised keyphrase distance analysis (KDA) technique. The proposed method is broken down into eight steps: gathering data, data preprocessing, data processing, searching keyphrases, distance calculation, averaging distance, curve plotting, and lastly, the curve fitting technique. The proposed approach begins by gathering two distinct datasets containing the news items, which are then used in the data preprocessing step, which makes use of a few preprocessing techniques. This preprocessed data is then employed in the data processing phase, where it is routed to the keyphrase searching, distance computation, and distance averaging phases. Finally, the curve fitting method is used after applying a curve plotting analysis. These two benchmark datasets are then used to evaluate and test the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed approach is then contrasted with different approaches to show how effective, advantageous, and significant it is. The results of the evaluation also proved that the proposed technique considerably improved the efficiency of keyphrase extraction techniques. It produces an F1-score value of 96.91% whereas its present keyphrases are 94.55%. © 2023, Science and Information Organization. All Rights Reserved."
"This article is devoted to the study of epithets and their translation in fiction. It is vital to transfer epithets properly, preserving the function and intent realized by the author in the original text by using proper semantic parallels and ensuring pragmatic equivalence in the target language of translation. Stylistic adequacy in translation presupposes the choice of appropriate language units in the target text, requiring a pre-translation analysis of the literary traditions of the target culture. There can be no doubt that the realization of the function of impact which is dominant in verbal creativity must be provided by the implementation of the translation strategy of re-metaphorization, though, depending on the norms of valency in the target language, the occurrences of some culturally-bound changes turn out to be inevitable in the translation process. The application of the linguo-stylistic method of analysis within the frame of the comparative approach allows to bring out the semantic, pragmatic, and stylistic nuances of the linguistic elements both in the source text and the target text. In the meantime, it underscores the predominance of the context which shapes those overtones to convey the specificities of the historical-cultural traditions reflected in the original text. © 2023, Editorial Board English Scholarship Beyond Borders.

"Pre-trained transformer-based language models (PLMs) have revolutionised text classification tasks, but their performance tends to deteriorate on data distant in time from the training dataset. Continual supervised re-training help address this issue but it is limited by the availability of newly labelled samples. This paper explores the longitudinal generalisation abilities of large generative PLMs, such as GPT-3 and T5, and smaller encoder-only alternatives for sentiment analysis in social media. We investigate the impact of time-related variations in data, model size, and fine-tuning on the classifiers’ performance. Through competitive evaluation in the CLEF-2023 LongEval Task 2, we compare results from fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot learning. Our analysis reveals the superior performance of large generative models over the benchmark RoBERTa and highlights the benefits of limited exposure to training data in achieving robust predictions on temporally distant test sets. The findings contribute to understanding how to build more temporally robust transformer-based text classifiers, reducing the need for continuous re-training with annotated data. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a particular subject, product, service, or topic. A deep learning technique called Sentiment and Context-Aware Hybrid Deep Neural Network (SCA-HDNN) was proposed for sentiment analysis. In SCA-HDNN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for sentiment classification. However, CNNs require fixed-sized inputs, which can be a limitation when dealing with sequences of different lengths. So in this paper, Recurrent CNN (RCNN) is introduced for sentiment classification. The incorporation of recurrent connections in each convolutional layer of RCNN enables handling variable-length sequences. RCNNs can be more computationally efficient than CNN. The combination of CNNs and RNNs allows for parallelization and shared computations across time steps, which can speed up training and inference for sentiment analysis. This method is named as SCA-RCNN. The results from the experiment demonstrate that the suggested SCA-RCNN method achieves high levels of accuracy, precision, and recall in sentiment analysis. © 2023 IEEE."
"In a multilingual world, reading in different languages is an essential skill. Both studies and news reports stress the importance of literacy and the fact that achieving good reading skills is not a given. Research has shown that the changing reading habits of young people in Finland, among other things, are reflected in their reading skills, as also the results of the PISA survey show. In a bilingual country like Finland, it is also important to promote linguistic diversity and inter-linguistic competence. The knowledge of both of Finland’s official languages is important both in everyday life and at school. The main challenge of reading in a foreign language is often the lack of language skills. Especially for reading comprehension, active engagement with the text is important. Previous research has shown that, with appropriate teaching methods, reading strategies can be transferred from the first language to a foreign language. Explicit and formal teaching of reading strategies can also lead to better reading comprehension in both the first language and a foreign language. Through the training of reading strategies, learners can become more active readers and promote their reading comprehension. In order to enable learners to use reading strategies independently, teachers must be familiar with the methods of teaching reading strategies. Successful teaching of reading strategies is influenced, for example, by the teaching style and skills used to explain the strategies and their use. In this article, I examine how mother tongue teachers (Finnish, Swedish) and teachers of German as a foreign language in Finland perceive the teaching and learning of reading strategies. I investigate their theoretical and action beliefs and their beliefs on teachers’ roles. The aim was to explore mother tongue and German teachers’ beliefs of reading strategies and the methods they use to introduce their students to active reading. I investigated how teachers guide their students to read and use reading strategies. The article also examines the links that teachers perceive between reading in the mother tongue and reading in a foreign language. Data was collected through individual interviews (n = 9) between September 2022 and January 2023. The data consists of semi-structured interviews based on themes that were selected based on previous research on the teaching of reading strategies. The individual interviews, lasting one hour on average, were conducted remotely and the interviews were recorded for analysis. The recorded interviews were transcribed. The analysis was carried out using qualitative content analysis and the NVivo software. The results show that the mother tongue teachers and German teachers interviewed in this study had partly similar beliefs of the teaching and learning of reading strategies. Both groups stressed the importance of a systematic approach towards the text and the active engagement with it, as well as teacher’s support for both. Regarding reading strategies, only some teachers had a wide theoretical understanding, while all teachers reported having used reading strategies in their teaching. Only some teachers reflected on interlanguage competence in reading skills and strategies. Both groups of teachers emphasised the role of the teacher as a motivator for reading. German teachers used authentic texts as a motivator, while mother tongue teachers allowed pupils to influence the choice of texts. © 2023, Estonian Association Applied Linguists.

"Purpose: The purpose of this scoping rapid review was to identify and analyse existing qualitative methodologies that have been used to investigate K-12 teachers' lived experiences of adult cyber abuse as a result of student content “going viral” to propose a novel methodological stance incorporating the Australian Online Safety Act 2021. Design/methodology/approach: A search of Google Scholar was conducted using keywords and phrases related to cyber trauma, teachers, qualitative methods and the Online Safety Act. Inclusion criteria for the review were: (1) published in English, (2) focused on teachers' experiences of online abuse and cyberbullying associated with viral posts and (3) employed a qualitative inquiry methodology. Full-text articles were obtained for those that met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and analysed using a PRISMA flowchart and inductive thematic analysis. Findings: This methodology is considered to be justified, as the eSafety Commissioner's Safety-by-Design principles do not have any legal or regulatory enforceability, whereas the Online Safety Act 2021 provides the Australian eSafety Commissioner an avenue to drive greater algorithmic transparency and accountability. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this review informed the development of a novel methodological stance for investigating Australian teachers' lived experiences of adult cyber abuse associated with viral posts. It provides a methodological positioning to support trauma informed qualitative research into adult cyber abuse, informed by the work of the eSafety Commissioner and the Online Safety Act. Originality/value: Cybertrauma is described as “any trauma that is a result of self- or, other-directed interaction with, mediated through, or from any electronic Internet/cyberspace ready device or machine learning algorithm, that results in impact now or the future” (Knibbs, 2021). It may result from the tracking of movement through various mobile phone features and applications such as location sharing, non-consensual monitoring of social media, and humiliation or punishment through the sharing of intimate images online, through to direct messages of abuse or threats of violence or humiliation. These actions are further perpetuated through automated searches, insights and recommendations on social media (i.e. engagement metrics promote memes, Facebook posts, Tweets, Tiktoks, Youtubes and so on). This is a novel methodology, as it not only considers direct cybertrauma but also automated forms of cybertrauma. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success in NLP and have recently been used for tasks in computational semantics. However, these tasks do not fully benefit from PLMs since meaning representations are not explicitly included in the pretraining stage. We introduce multilingual pre-trained language-meaning models based on Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs), including meaning representations besides natural language texts in the same model, and design a new strategy to reduce the gap between the pre-training and fine-tuning objectives. Since DRSs are language neutral, cross-lingual transfer learning is adopted to further improve the performance of non-English tasks. Automatic evaluation results show that our approach achieves the best performance on both the multilingual DRS parsing and DRS-to-text generation tasks. Correlation analysis between automatic metrics and human judgements on the generation task further validates the effectiveness of our model. Human inspection reveals that out-of-vocabulary tokens are the main cause of erroneous results. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Named Entity Sentiment analysis (NESA) is one of the most actively developing application domains in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Social media NESA is a significant field of opinion analysis since detecting and tracking sentiment trends in the news flow is crucial for building various analytical systems and monitoring the media image of specific people or companies. In this paper, we study different transformers-based solutions NESA in RuSentNE-23 evaluation. Despite the effectiveness of the BERT-like models, they can still struggle with certain challenges, such as overfitting, which appeared to be the main obstacle in achieving high accuracy on the RuSentNE-23 data. We present several approaches to overcome this problem, among which there is a novel technique of additional pass over given data with masked entity before making the final prediction so that we can combine logits from the model when it knows the exact entity it predicts sentiment for and when it does not. Utilizing this technique, we ensemble multiple BERT-like models trained on different subsets of data to improve overall performance. Our proposed model achieves the best result on RuSentNE-23 evaluation data and demonstrates improved consistency in entity-level sentiment analysis. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"This paper firstly researches the ideological and political education in higher education institutions in the background of the big data era and puts forward the innovation strategy of ideological and political education mode in higher education institutions in the big data era. Secondly, it studies the application of data mining technology in colleges and universities for ideological and political education. Based on data mining technology, the data on ideological and political education is determined by the clustering algorithm, followed by a quantitative examination of the policy text of ideological and political education of colleges and universities by calculating the quantitative statistical analysis of policy text, word frequency, and word cloud analysis. Then, the research subjects were selected, and the initial data were obtained using questionnaires, further pre-processing, and further empirical analysis of ideological and political education based on data mining technology. The consequences show that the proportions contained in the three types of score bands, namely 17.99%, 59.38% and 9.96%, basically match with the sample proportions accounted for by the three types of grades assessed by clustering, namely 30.51%, 62.02% and 8.47%, which confirms that such a model of data mining adopted according to the quantitative table of ideologic and politic education assessment in higher education institution is a very successful model. This study contributes to the innovation of online ideological and political education work in higher education institutions in the context of big data.  © 2023 Zheng Qiu, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Background: Sexting refers to the exchange of sexually explicit digital content in the form of texts, photos, or videos. In recent years, sexting has become a public health concern. Surveys in Malaysia show a high prevalence of young adults engaged in sexting. Given that sexting is associated with sexual risk behavior, cyberbullying, and mental health issues, this behavior needs intervention to alleviate the resulting public health burden. However, there is a scarcity of theory-based intervention programs on the prevention of intention and willingness to sext among young adults. Objective: This study aimed to develop and implement a sexting intervention module guided by the prototype willingness model (PWM), delivered using web-based animated video, and evaluate its effectiveness among diploma students from a public higher educational institution. The primary outcomes were intention and willingness to sext, while the secondary outcomes were knowledge, attitude, perceived norms, and prototype perceptions of sexting. Methods: This 2-armed, parallel, single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in a public higher educational institution in the state of Melaka, Malaysia. Diploma students from 12 programs were randomly allocated into intervention and control groups. Both groups answered a self-administered web-based questionnaire assessing the outcomes at the baseline. The intervention group received a newly developed intervention module based on the PWM in the form of 5 animated videos posted on a private YouTube platform, while the control group was put on the waitlist. The intervention group was encouraged to discuss any issues raised with the researchers via WhatsApp private chat after viewing the videos. All participants were observed immediately and 3 months postintervention. Data analysis was performed with SPSS (version 26; IBM Corp). A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Results: There were a total of 300 participants with an attrition rate of 8.3% (n=25). After adjusting for age, sex, relationship status, and the amount of time spent on the web, there were significant differences in the intention to sext (β=–.12; P=.002; Cohen d=0.23), willingness to sext (β=–.16; P<.001; Cohen d=0.40), knowledge (β=.12; P<.001; Cohen d=0.39), attitude (β=–.11; P=.001; Cohen d=0.31), perceived norms (β=–.06; P=.04; Cohen d=0.18), and prototype perceptions (β=–.11; P<.001; Cohen d=0.35) between the intervention and control groups over 3 months. Conclusions: In this study, the sexting intervention module using the PWM that was delivered via web-based animated videos was effective in reducing intention and willingness to sext as well as in improving knowledge of sexting, attitudes, perceived norms, and prototype perceptions. Therefore, relevant agencies involved in the promotion of sexual and reproductive health among young adults in Malaysia can consider the implementation of this module. © Norain Mansor, Norliza Ahmad, Salmiah Md Said, Kit-Aun Tan, Rosnah Sutan."
"Nutrition in sports, as a branch of nutritional science, is a constantly developing field with a growing number of scientific researches and recommendations concerning the justification of the diet composition to ensure the requirements for macro- and micronutrients of the athlete’s body at different stages of sports activity and energy value, as well as the use of special dietary supplements of various nature, including protein in forms of specialized dry mixes, drinks, etc. The aim of the research was to present the results of studies conducted abroad, presented in review publications and original articles, on the role of protein and the impact of its various levels of consumption on the maintenance of muscle mass as a criterion for the effectiveness of diets used, including in conditions of their reduced calorie content; on the safety of consuming significantly higher than recommended amounts of protein (>2.0 g/kg of body weight per day); about the relationship between protein dose and the possible increase in lean body mass. Material and methods. For the main source search, the PubMed Internet resource was used, and the websites of the Springer and Elsevier publishers were used to access the full text of the articles. Search depth 10 years. Results. This review presents the official position of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) on the role of protein in training optimization, body composition change and improving the performance of athletes. Generalized data on the body’s energy costs for the assimilation of nutrients, food thermogenesis and the importance of protein for maintaining resting energy expenditure are presented. Published results based on meta-analyses support the efficacy of higher protein intake in reducing body weight and fat mass while maintaining lean mass in an energy-deficient setting. The anabolic properties of protein under conditions of increased physical exertion will manifest themselves only with sufficient energy and protein supply. The proposed values and boundaries within which increased protein intake effectively affect body composition in the process of adaptation to strength training are given. It has been shown that an increase in protein intake above the average maximum values practically does not lead to an increase in lean body mass without the simultaneous introduction of additional resistance exercises that restores its growth. In accordance with the official position of the ISSN, the recommended protein intake corresponds to values from 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg of body weight per day for individuals performing various special sets of physical exercises. The use of high-protein diets (protein >2.0 g/kg/day) in highly qualified athletes who do not have kidney and liver diseases showed no changes in the biochemical parameters of blood and bone mineral density confirming its safety. Conclusion. Based on the analysis of scientific data, it can be stated that proteins make the main contribution to the thermogenesis of the body compared to other dietary macronutrients. The effect of protein intake on body composition, recovery and muscle building of an athlete has been proven. Athletes require higher amounts of protein to optimal increase of lean body mass under increased training loads and to maintain lean mass under an energy-deficient diet. If necessary, high-protein diets can be used in highly qualified athletes without kidney or liver diseases, but comprehensive researches in this direction should be continued. © 2023 Nutritec.

"This paper presents an innovative solution to mitigate the risk of unintended lifting clamp selection in Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) installations by implementing the Poka-Yoke methodology. The potential for accidents in oilfield operations can be grave, so proactive measures must be taken. Through a thorough case study investigating a dropped ESP seal, an integrated approach to safety and quality risk analysis led to the implementation of Poka-Yoke for continuous improvement to minimize risks and improve process reliability. The implementation of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) infused with the ingenious Poka-Yoke tool from Lean Manufacturing Methodology was initiated to curtail potential hazards in ESP installations. The following steps were taken: (1) Creation of a Multidisciplinary Team, including those who work directly in the process; (2) Route Cause Analysis and Hazard Assessment; (3) Brainstorming Sessions to fortify ideas and procedures for the detection and eradication of threats using the Poka-Yoke concept; (4) Implementation of a Pilot-Scale Solution; (5) follow-up meetings for Process Revision, (6) Improvement process lead by process revision, and (7) dissemination of knowledge to the entire company through workshops and pre-job meetings. The Poka-Yoke system employs a color code system that matches the lifting clamps with their corresponding ESP equipment. Furthermore, a custom colored-scale caliper was implemented to check the diameters of the equipment and their respective lifting clamps, ensuring that they are correctly matched. The use of visual signals instead of texts in this system greatly simplifies the information conveyed, making it more accessible and understandable to all stakeholders involved in the operation. The article introduces a Lean Manufacturing Methodology concept adapted for service delivery, emphasizing the reduction of operational risks. By utilizing the Poka-Yoke tool to detect and prevent errors, it is possible to enhance the reliability of a process. This is achieved by reducing the probability of errors resulting from human error or other factors, which in turn can minimize the occurrence of defects, rework, and other quality-related concerns that could compromise the process's reliability. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference."
"Overlapping frequently occurs in paired texts in natural language processing tasks like text editing and semantic similarity evaluation. Better evaluation of the semantic distance between the overlapped sentences benefits the language system's understanding and guides the generation. Since conventional semantic metrics are based on word representations, they are vulnerable to the disturbance of overlapped components with similar representations. This paper aims to address the issue with a mask-and-predict strategy. We take the words in the longest common sequence (LCS) as neighboring words and use masked language modeling (MLM) from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to predict the distributions in their positions. Our metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence (NDD), represents the semantic distance by calculating the divergence between distributions in the overlapped parts. Experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity show NDD to be more sensitive to various semantic differences, especially on highly overlapped paired texts. Based on the discovery, we further implement an unsupervised and training-free method for text compression, leading to a significant improvement on the previous perplexity-based method. The high compression rate controlling ability of our method even enables NDD to outperform the supervised state-of-the-art in domain adaption by a huge margin. Further experiments on syntax and semantics analyses verify the awareness of internal sentence structures, indicating the high potential of NDD for further studies. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Introduction: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are potentially obesogenic for children. We undertook a systematic review to synthesize this literature and explore sources of heterogeneity in previously published epidemiological studies. Methods: Studies that collected individual-level PFAS and anthropometric data from children up to 12 years of age were identified by searching six databases. We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects. Results: We identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of −0.16 (95% CI: −0.22, −0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s). Conclusion: Our review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies. Future research that can inform on the effects of exposure mixtures, the timing of the exposure, outcome measures, and the shape of the exposure-response curve is needed. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"In the medical field, there are many clinical texts such as electronic medical records, and research on Japanese natural language processing using these texts has been conducted. One such research involves Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) in clinical texts using a semantic analysis and logical inference system, ccg2lambda. However, it is difficult for existing inference systems to correctly determine the entailment relations, if the input sentence contains medical domain specific paraphrases such as disease names. In this study, we propose a method to supplement the equivalence relations of disease names as axioms by identifying candidates for paraphrases that lack in theorem proving. Candidates of paraphrases are identified by using a model for the NER task for disease names and a disease name dictionary. We also construct an inference test set that requires knowledge injection of disease names and evaluate our inference system. Experiments showed that our inference system was able to correctly infer for 106 out of 149 inference test sets.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Among many by-products of Web 2.0 come the wide range of potential image and text datasets within social media and content sharing platforms that speak of how people live, what they do, and what they care about. These datasets are imperfect and biased in many ways, but those flaws make them complementary to data derived from conventional social science methods and thus potentially useful for triangulation in complex decision-making contexts. Yet the online environment is highly mutable, and so the datasets are less reliable than censuses or other standard data types leveraged in social impact assessment. Over the past decade, we have innovated numerous methods for deploying Instagram datasets in investigating management or development alternatives. This article synthesizes work from three Canadian decision contexts – hydroelectric dam construction or removal; dyke realignment or wetland restoration; and integrating renewable energy into vineyard landscapes – to illustrate some of the methods we have applied to social impact assessment questions using Instagram that may be transferrable to other social media platforms and contexts: thematic (manual coding, machine vision, natural language processing/sentiment analysis, statistical analysis), spatial (hotspot mapping, cultural ecosystem modeling), and visual (word clouds, saliency mapping, collage). We conclude with a set of cautions and next steps for the domain. © The Author(s) 2023."
"We investigate the representation of pretrained language models and humans, using the idea of word definition modeling-how well a word is represented by its definition, and vice versa. Our analysis shows that a word representation in pretrained language models does not successfully map its human-written definition and its usage in example sentences. We then present a simple method DefBERT that integrates pretrained models with word semantics in dictionaries. We show its benefits on newly-proposed tasks of definition ranking and definition sense disambiguation. Furthermore, we present the results on standard word similarity tasks and short text classification tasks where models are required to encode semantics with only a few words. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating word definitions and pretrained language models. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This paper first discusses the application of text mining techniques in public security, with the research focus on case classification, feature extraction, and collusion analysis in civil litigation. A plain Bayesian-based first-level classifier is proposed to accurately classify first-level case texts. For all second-level case category document sets, keyword cooccurrence mapping is used to replace word frequency as a metric for feature selection, and a second-level classifier is constructed using a simple vector distance algorithm. Finally, the impact of time-barred benefit abandonment and time-barred benefit loss on the evolutionary system in civil litigation is investigated in depth using the pilot water tax reform in Hunan Province as a case study. The results show that when one of the subjects chooses to discard the statute of limitations benefits, x and y show a trend of steadily increasing convergence to 1 from the initial point, and the final stabilization point tends to (1,1). This paper aims to provide references and suggestions for reforming information and optimizing civil litigation.  © 2023 Baosheng Shen, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Approaches for unsupervised opinion summarization are generally based on the reconstruction model and generate a summary by decoding the aggregated representation of inputs. Recent work has shown that aggregating via simple average leads to vector degeneration, generating the generic summary. To tackle the challenge, some approaches select the inputs before aggregating. However, we argue that the selection is too coarse as not all information in each input is equally essential for the summary. For example, the content information such as “great coffee maker, easy to set up” is more valuable than the pattern such as “this is a great product”. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised opinion summarization based on text representation disentanglement with counter-template. In specific, a disentangling module is added to the encoder-decoder architecture which decouples the input text representation into two parts: content and pattern. To capture the pattern information, a counter-template is utilized as supervision, which is automatically generated based on contrastive learning. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both quality and stability. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The projects are highly compatible with the teaching and learning functions of educational organizations. This research, which evaluates the project capacity of schools affiliated to the Ministry of National Education, is a case study. The research was completed with data collected from Giresun, Ordu and Sivas provinces. In this context, this paper covers the completed/ongoing project statistics of the relevant provinces between the years 2015-2022 in the dataset of the research, opinions of research and development unit (R&D) experts, school administrators and teachers who manage them. In the research, the data obtained from the provincial statistics were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative content analysis, and the ones obtained from the face-to-face interviews were analyzed by phenomenological coding. According to research, there are initiatives, which was completed or in progress, are being supported by various organizations (such as the National Agency, development agencies, and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye-TÜBİTAK) in schools of various types and levels with various motivations (education-teaching development, invention, mobility, social responsibility, etc.). The results of the research indicate the existence of factors that affect the project capacity of educational organizations positively and negatively. The factors that positively affect the project capacity of educational organizations: strengths and opportunities, negative factors: weaknesses and threats are analyzed. As the results indicate while school culture, administrator-teacher leadership, physical conditions of schools and development expectations affect the project capacity positively; sustainability, effectiveness, student qualifications and the conflict of project roles with other roles have a negative efect on it. While the curriculum applied to the primary education level and the project contents prepared at that level are compatible, the same cannot be achieved with the curriculum applied to the secondary education level. In the text, in which the research results are discussed together with other research findings, a group of suggestions have been made to improve the project capacity of educational organizations. © 2023, T.C.

"Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) have in recent years become the dominant paradigm in applied NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering, sentiment analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical domain, significant progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP tasks that require the integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as statistical modelling of language. In particular, research in this area has focused on the question of how best to construct LMs that take into account not only the patterns of token distribution in medical text, but also the wealth of structured information contained in terminology resources such as the UMLS. This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for enriching the language representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by extracting text sequences from the UMLS. This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be combined with masked-language pre-training. Preliminary results from experiments in the extension of pre-trained LMs as well as training from scratch show that this framework improves downstream performance on multiple biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. All pre-trained models, data processing pipelines and evaluation scripts will be made publicly available.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"There is a multitude of textual data relevant to the financial markets, spanning genres such as financial news, earnings conference calls, and social media posts. Earnings conference calls are one of the most important to information flow as they reflect a direct communication between company executives, financial analysts, and large shareholders. Since these calls contain content that is forward-looking in nature, they can be used to forecast the future performance of the company relative to market expectations. However, they typically contain over 5,000 words of text and large amounts of industry jargon. This length and domain-specific language present problems for many generic pretrained language models. In this work, we introduce a novel task of predicting earnings surprises from earnings call transcripts and contribute a new long document dataset that tests financial understanding with complex signals. We explore a variety of approaches for this long document classification task and establish some strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict companies' future earnings surprises from solely the text of their conference calls with reasonable accuracy. Finally, we probe the models through different interpretability methods and reveal some intuitive explanations of the linguistic features captured that go beyond traditional sentiment analysis. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Background: Owing to the demographic changes in the elderly population worldwide, delivering coordinated care at home to multimorbid older adults is of great importance. Older adults living with multiple chronic conditions need information to manage and coordinate their care. eHealth can be effective for gaining sufficient information, communicating, and self-managing chronic conditions. However, incorporating older adults’ health preferences and ensuring active involvement remain challenging. More knowledge is needed to ensure successful participation and eHealth use in care coordination. Objective: This study aimed to explore multimorbid older adults’ experiences with participation and eHealth in care coordination with general practitioners (GPs) and district nurses (DNs). Methods: The study had a qualitative explorative approach. Data collection included semistructured interviews with 20 older adults with multimorbidity receiving primary care services from their GPs and DNs. The participants were included by their GPs or nurses at a local intermunicipal acute inpatient care unit. The data analysis was guided by systematic text condensation. Results: We identified 2 categories: (1) older adults in charge of and using eHealth in care coordination, and (2) older adults with a loss of control in care coordination. The first category describes how communication with GPs and DNs can facilitate participation, the importance of managing own medication, and how eHealth can support older adults’ information needs. The second category focuses on older adults who depend on guidance and help from their GPs and DNs to manage their health, describing how a lack of capacity and system support to be involved makes these adults lose control of their care coordination. Conclusions: Being in charge of care coordination is important for older multimorbid adults. The results show that older adults are willing to use eHealth to be informed and to seek information, which ensures high levels of participation in care coordination. Future research should investigate how older adults can be involved in electronic information sharing with health care providers. ©Hilde Marie Hunsbedt Fjellså, Anne Marie Lunde Husebø, Harald Braut, Aslaug Mikkelsen, Marianne Storm."
"The article presents an interdisciplinary stylistic study of the language of Yehuda Amichai’s poetry in his last and enigmatic book, “Open Closed Open” (1998). The study examines his extensive use of contrast words and their contribution to the cohesion and poetics of the book’s poems. All 296 poems in the book were examined, and the contrast words were documented alongside the content of each poem. Stylistic examination reveals an exceptionally extensive 138 appearances of contrast words, among them 107 occurrences of aval. Analysis of the discourse in this research focuses on the function of the contrast words, and their meaning is determined according to semantic distinctions, which are based on the text’s interpretation. It was found that the cohesion in the book is reflected in structure and content, which explains the enigmatic meaning of the book’s title. © Bat-Zion Yememi 2023."
"Background. Successful execution of invasive procedures in acute care settings, including tracheal intubation, requires careful coordination of an interprofessional team. The stress inherent to the intensive care unit (ICU) environment may threaten the optimal communication and planning necessary for the safe execution of this complex procedure. The objective of this study is to characterize the perceptions of interprofessional team members surrounding tracheal intubations in the pediatric ICU (PICU). Methods. This is a single-center survey-based study of staff involved in the intubation of pediatric patients admitted to a tertiary level academic PICU. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists (RT) involved in tracheal intubations were queried via standardized, discipline-specific electronic surveys regarding their involvement in procedural planning and overall awareness of and comfort with the intubation plan. Qualitative variables were assessed by both Likert scales and free-text comments that were grouped and analyzed thematically. Results. One hundred and eleven intubation encounters were included during the study time period, of which 93 (84%) had survey responses from at least 2 professional teams. Among those included in the analysis, the survey was completed 244 times by members of the PICU teams including 86 responses from physicians, 76 from nurses, and 82 from RTs. Survey response rates were >80% from each provider team. There were significant differences in interprofessional team comfort with nurses feeling less well informed and comfortable with the intubation plan and process compared to physicians and RTs (p < 0.001 for both). Qualitative themes including clear communication, adequate planning and preparation prior to procedure initiation, and clear definition of roles emerged among both affirmative and constructive comments. Conclusions. Exploration of provider perceptions and emergence of constructive themes expose opportunities for teamwork improvement strategies involving intubations in the PICU. The use of a preintubation checklist may improve organization and communication amongst team members, increase provider morale, decrease team stress levels, and, ultimately, may improve patient outcomes during this high stakes, coordinated event.  © 2023 Chetna K.

"Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to extract aspects from text-image pairs and recognize their sentiments. Existing methods make great efforts to align the whole image to corresponding aspects. However, different regions of the image may relate to different aspects in the same sentence, and coarsely establishing image-aspect alignment will introduce noise to aspect-based sentiment analysis (i.e., visual noise). Besides, the sentiment of a specific aspect can also be interfered by descriptions of other aspects (i.e., textual noise). Considering the aforementioned noises, this paper proposes an Aspect-oriented Method (AoM) to detect aspect-relevant semantic and sentiment information. Specifically, an aspect-aware attention module is designed to simultaneously select textual tokens and image blocks that are semantically related to the aspects. To accurately aggregate sentiment information, we explicitly introduce sentiment embedding into AoM, and use a graph convolutional network to model the vision-text and text-text interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AoM to existing methods.

"Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems are gaining popularity recently due to the advancements in deep neural networks (DNN) and machine learning and the availability of databases of speech of language learners. Unfortunately, research in Arabic CAPT systems suffer from the lack of CAPT datasets compared to other languages. In this paper, we present the details of and the ideas used in the development of a versatile dataset of speech, real and synthesized, of Arabic Learners. To develop the dataset, we utilized an existing Arabic speech corpus, King Saud University Speech Database (KSU-SD). KSU-SD's main application was a speaker recognition system, but it was designed to be useful in other applications such as CAPT systems. KSU-SD includes a large number of speakers from diverse nationalities (Saudis, Arabs, and Non-Arabs). KSU-SD contains the recording of about 60 non-native speakers from more than 20 nationalities, hence we selected it to build the non-native Arabic-CAPT corpus. The developed corpus consists of transcribed, segmented, and annotated speech, which makes it suitable for building Arabic CAPT systems. In addition to presenting the details of developing the dataset, we also present an analysis of the text and speech errors of the dataset. The dataset was verified by many CAPT systems. © 2023 IEEE."
"Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to examine the cognitive impact of psychotropic medications including benzodiazepines, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or a combination of these drugs on older adults. Design: Systematic review. Setting: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase through the Ovid platform, CINAHL through EBSCO, and Web of Science. Participants and interventions: Randomized control trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that used a validated scale to measure cognition with a follow-up period of at least six months were included. Measurement: The primary outcome of interest was cognitive change associated with psychotropic medication use. Results: A total of 7551 articles were identified from the primary electronic literature search across the five databases after eliminating duplicates. Based on full-text analysis, 27 articles (two RCTs, 25 cohorts) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, nine each examined the impact of benzodiazepines and antidepressants, five examined psychotropic combinations, three on antipsychotic drugs, and one on the effects of mood stabilizers. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review to examine the cognitive impact of multiple psychotropic drug classes in older adults over an extended follow-up period (six months or more) using robust sample sizes, drug-free control groups, and validated cognitive instruments. We found evidence to indicate cognitive decline with the cumulative use of benzodiazepines and the use of antidepressants, especially those with anticholinergic properties among older adults without cognitive impairment at baseline. Further, the use of antipsychotics and psychotropic combinations is also associated with cognitive decline in older adults.  © International Psychogeriatric Association 2023."
"The cross-domain text-to-SQL task aims to build a system that can parse user questions into SQL on complete unseen databases, and the single-domain text-to-SQL task evaluates the performance on identical databases. Both of these setups confront unavoidable difficulties in real-world applications. To this end, we introduce the cross-schema text-to-SQL task, where the databases of evaluation data are different from that in the training data but come from the same domain. Furthermore, we present CSS, a large-scale CrosS-Schema Chinese text-to-SQL dataset, to carry on corresponding studies. CSS originally consisted of 4,340 question/SQL pairs across 2 databases. In order to generalize models to different medical systems, we extend CSS and create 19 new databases along with 29,280 corresponding dataset examples. Moreover, CSS is also a large corpus for single-domain Chinese text-to-SQL studies. We present the data collection approach and a series of analyses of the data statistics. To show the potential and usefulness of CSS, benchmarking baselines have been conducted and reported.

"Motivational beliefs, such as writing self-efficacy and attitude toward writing, are believed to foster or hinder writing by influencing if one chooses to write, how much effort is committed to writing, and what cognitive resources writers apply. In the current study, we examined self-efficacy for writing self-regulation and attitude toward writing of 2,124 Grade 2 Norwegian students (1,069 girls; 1,055 boys). We investigated if there were differences in each of these beliefs between girls and boys and students who differed in their language status (Norwegian first language, Norwegian and another language both first language, or language other than Norwegian first language). We further tested if each of these writing motivational beliefs made statistically unique contributions to predicting the quality of students’ writing. In each of these analyses, we controlled for variance related to individual- and school factors. Girls were more positive about writing than boys, and they were confident about their abilities to self-regulate writing. Students with Norwegian and another language both as first language (“bilingual” students) had a more positive attitude toward writing than the other two language groups. Efficacy for writing self-regulation and attitude toward writing both made statistically significant unique contributions to predicting the quality of students writing, although these two writing beliefs collectively accounted for just 2% of the variance in writing quality scores once individual- and school-factors were controlled. Recommendations for future research and implications of the finding are discussed. Copyright © 2023 Skar, Graham and Huebner."
"She tries her tongue, her silence softly breaks (1989), M. NourbeSe Philip’s widely acclaimed poetry collection,1 explores the themes of identity, diaspora, colonialism and exile and how these are intimately related to language. Through the analysis of selected poems, this essay aims to explore the crucial role played by language in the lyrical subject’s struggle to come to terms with her identity as a Black immigrant woman, her sense of belonging, and with her own use of the English language. This analysis and interpretation draws on key concepts such as nation language (Brathwaite), in betweenness (Bhabha), the violence of language and the remainder (Lecercle). I argue that Philip subverts Western literary forms as a way of denouncing and resisting the violence perpetrated by the English language against the peoples of the African diaspora. In her poems, this is achieved mainly through the fragmentation of words and the collage of scientific and legal texts, as well as through a permanent questioning of the power of the English language. This act of resistance is, for the poet, the only way to tell her story and to open the space for other stories to be shared and other voices to be heard. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"This article approaches the role of translation in Iberian literary modernity not as a question of importation of foreign models from Europe but rather as a question of the circulation of texts and cultural traditions within Iberia. It focuses on translation projects that originated within and among Iberian cultures in the nineteenth century, and that projected themselves outward. This study proposes a genealogy that links the revival and spread of floral games in Catalonia and across Spain beginning in the 1850s to translation practices in the Peninsula in the early twentieth century. After an analysis of the relationship between the spread of the floral games and the perception of their decadence in Catalan literary historiography, the article proposes an alternate understanding of the phenomenon that links the floral tradition to translingual cultural projects. Particular attention is paid to the ‘polyglot edition’ of Catalan poet Joaquim Rubió i Ors’ Lo Gayter del Llobregat (‘The piper of the Llobregat River’) (1888–1902). This publication, like the floral tradition that proliferated alongside it, reflects an effort to create a multilingual literary sphere anchored in the Iberian Peninsula that Spanish and Catalan literary histories have overlooked. © 2023 Intellect Ltd."
"This paper includes a hermeneutic revision of Ann Hood's novel The Knitting Circle (2006), a text that has been scarcely approached from the perspective of literary theory and criticism. In order to carry out this analysis, particularly focused on its protagonist, the presuppositions of trauma studies are employed, especially the considerations of Laurie Vickroy, as well as the semiotics of the textile in terms of its discursive and collective potential. Through the prism of close reading, it is proposed that the textile activity (and, by extension, the community that is generated around it) fosters a process of psychological recovery that depends not only on the articulation of the traumatic event, but also on the forms of social experiencing established around that episode. © 2023 Slavistica Vilnensis.

"Neural language models are vulnerable to word-level adversarial text attacks, which generate adversarial examples by directly substituting discrete input words. Previous search methods for word-level attacks assume that the information in the important words is more influential on prediction than unimportant words. In this paper, motivated by this assumption, we propose a self-supervised regularization method for Similarizing the Influence of Words with Contrastive Learning (SIWCon) that encourages the model to learn sentence representations in which words of varying importance have a more uniform influence on prediction. Experiments show that SIWCon is compatible with various training methods and effectively improves model robustness against various unforeseen adversarial attacks. The effectiveness of SIWCon is also intuitively shown through qualitative analysis and visualization of the loss landscape, sentence representation, and changes in model confidence. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Although psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective form of help, its effectiveness has been hitting an imaginary ceiling for several decades. A possible reason for this is the lack of immediate feedback that would allow therapists to detect various difficulties early in the therapeutic process and respond appropriately. Existing research shows that, as therapists, we tend to overestimate our skills and often fail to recognize dissatisfaction and deterioration in our clients in a timely manner. This text aims to introduce DeePsy, an online tool for continuous monitoring of the psychotherapy process and outcome. The application provides therapists with ongoing and systematic feedback on their work based on regularly administered questionnaires and automatic analysis of session recordings. The article explains the basic principles underlying DeePsy and describes its current status. It also offers a reflection on feedback in the broader context of the culture of psychotherapeutic work. © 2023 Masaryk University, Faculty of Social Studies. All rights reserved."

"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ireland implemented a series of stringent public health measures, including lockdowns and suspension of non-urgent clinical services. Aims: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for and delivery of speech and language therapy (SLT) services in Ireland in 2020. Methods & Procedures: Two iterations of a cross-sectional, mixed-methods online survey were distributed to speech and language therapists (SLTs) and SLT students in Ireland in the spring and autumn of 2020 using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling. The spring survey yielded 407 responses (including 14 from SLT students), while 197 respondents took part in the autumn (13 students). Survey analysis focused on questions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery and demand for SLT services (student responses were excluded from analysis owing to low response rate). The largest group in respect of experience were senior SLTs (58% in both surveys). The work settings most strongly represented were HSE primary care (34.4%) and disability services (26.5%) in the spring, and HSE primary care (39.1%), acute hospitals (22.8%) and disability services (20.8%) in the autumn. We used descriptive statistics, including distribution analysis, to analyse the quantitative data. Free text data were interrogated through a variant of a conventional qualitative content analysis. Outcomes & Results: In the spring, cessation of face-to-face services featured prominently (reported by 65.6% versus 14.2% in the autumn), across SLTs’ work settings, except acute hospitals. Lower demand was reported by 42.5% in the spring, while in the autumn, 48.7% indicated that demand was higher. SLTs experienced large-scale redeployment (spring: 45.9%, autumn: 38.4%), with HSE primary care SLTs redeployed most (spring: 71.7%; autumn: 62.3%). The need to suddenly pivot to telehealth was a significant challenge in terms of training, technology and logistics. New ways of working emerged and gradually, telehealth became more embedded. SLTs also had to adapt to working with evolving public health measures, such as space restrictions and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Across the two survey iterations, SLTs reported tensions between demands and capacity: while referrals and demand initially decreased in the spring, this led to increased backlog and longer waiting lists, ongoing and increasing pressure on clinicians and services, and negatively impacted clients and families. Conclusions & Implications: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on SLT services in Ireland. Going forward, the SLT profession and its services will require sustained support to mitigate long-term negative consequences, such as increased waiting lists. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SLT services has been examined in several countries. Ireland imposed more stringent pandemic-management measures than many other countries, and it was therefore warranted to investigate how SLT services in the country were affected. What this study adds to the existing knowledge Face-to-face SLT services effectively ceased in most non-urgent contexts in spring 2020. This coincided with large-scale redeployment of SLTs to non-SLT contexts. By autumn 2020, demand had increased again, but not all services had recommenced, and redeployment was still a factor. Although SLTs adapted to the ongoing changes imposed by the pandemic, they voiced concern about increasing backlogs and longer waiting lists, ongoing and increasing pressure on both SLTs and services, and negative impacts on clients and families. What are the actual and clinical implications of this work? The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on SLT services in Ireland. Going forward, the SLT profession and its services will require sustained support to mitigate long-term negative consequences, such as increased waiting lists. © 2023 The Authors.

"We present a framework called G3R for complex and cross-domain Text-to-SQL generation. G3R aims to address two limitations of current approaches: (1) The structure of the abstract syntax tree (AST) is not fully explored during the decoding process which is crucial for complex SQL generation; (2) Domain knowledge is not incorporated to enhance their ability to generalise to unseen domains. G3R consists of a graph-guided SQL generator and a knowledge-enhanced re-ranking mechanism. Firstly, during the decoding process, an AST-Grammar bipartite graph is constructed for joint modelling the AST and corresponding grammar rules of the generated partial SQL query. The graph-guided SQL generator captures its structural information and fuses heterogeneous information to predict the action sequence, which can uniquely construct the AST for the corresponding SQL query. Then, in the inference stage, a knowledge-enhanced re-ranking mechanism is proposed to introduce domain knowledge to re-rank candidate SQL queries from the beam output and choose the final answer. The SQL re-ranker is based on a pre-trained language model (PLM) and contrastive learning with hybrid prompt tuning is incorporated to stimulate the knowledge of the PLM and make it more discriminative. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider and Spider-DK benchmarks, which are challenging complex and cross-domain benchmarks for Text-to-SQL semantic analysis. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Currently, chatbots face the issues such as inadequate use of multi-modality information, poor feelings of expression competence, and a lack of a model fusion mechanism. Deep learning applications include NLP-based ""natural language understanding (NLU)"", sentiment analysis, machine translation, and word vector representation. People have started looking into the new capabilities of chatbots and applying deep learning techniques to chatbots. Provided the actual problem that conventional chatbots Seq-2-Seq model training tends to produce quite secure, widely accepted, and repetitive responses to the speech corpus, this article utilizes the understanding of cooperative pieces of evidence to develop the optimization problem of the model in order to generate better and much more versatile response by the model and can provide to the client with a better and expected and quality outcome. Results of the experiment revealed that the model was found to outperform the single model in many indicators in the short text given data experiment. © 2023 IEEE."
"Mining public opinions about vaccines from social media has been increasingly relevant to analyse trends in public debates and to provide quick insights to policy-makers. However, the application of existing models has been hindered by the wide variety of users' attitudes and the new aspects continuously arising in the public debate. Existing approaches, frequently framed via well-known tasks, such as aspect classification or text span detection, make direct usage of the supervision information constraining the models to predefined aspect classes, while still not distinguishing those aspects from users' stances. As a result, this has significantly hindered the dynamic integration of new aspects. We thus propose a model, namely Disentangled Opinion Clustering (DOC), for vaccination opinion mining from social media. DOC is able to disentangle users' stances from opinions via a disentangling attention mechanism and a Swapping-Autoencoder, and is designed to process unseen aspect categories via a clustering approach, leveraging clustering-friendly representations induced by out-of-the-box Sentence-BERT encodings and disentangling mechanisms. We conduct a thorough experimental assessment demonstrating the benefit of the disentangling mechanisms and cluster-based approach on both the quality of aspect clusters and the generalization across new aspect categories, outperforming existing methodologies on aspect-based opinion mining. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The demand for a creative workforce has never been higher, yet schools struggle to teach and assess creativity among students efficiently. Compositions are an effective way to incorporate creativity across the curriculum; however, essays are time consuming to evaluate for quality or creativity. This study explored (a) if high creativity scores are related to high quality and sophistication in academic writing, and (b) if extant text-mining tools effectively identify quality, sophistication, and creativity in academic essays. Four teacher raters analyzed quality, sophistication, and creativity of 230 essays written by students aged 15–17 for Advanced Placement Language and Composition. We also used text-mining tools (e.g., semantic distance, Shannon's entropy, idea density) to score these essays. Teacher-rated creativity scores correlated with quality and sophistication scores, as well as with some of the text-mining tools, suggesting that these tools can capture quality and sophistication in addition to creativity. Implications for educational practice are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Introduction. The article discusses the image of the ancestral homeland of the Slavs as described in the early 12th century Old-Russian chronicle known as the “Tale of Bygone Years.” Methods and materials. The focus of the article is on the concept of the Danube Slavic land, which, according to the chronicle, was the ancient homeland of the Slavs. In order to elucidate this concept, the author uses elements of historical-semantic analysis of the text and compares its information with data from other sources relevant for the study of this topic. Analysis. Taking into account the heterogeneity of knowledge underlying the chronicle ethnogenetic construction, the author identifies various elements of this knowledge. Results. The author comes to the conclusion that the image of the Danube homeland of the Slavs was not a bookish construction but a reflection of the ethnic realities of the early Middle Ages, when the Carpathian basin was the core area of the Slavic ethnic identity. According to the author, the formation of the idea that the Middle Danube Slavic land was the primary homeland of the Slavs was also the result of the perception of the Slavs as autochthonous inhabitants of Illyricum and Pannonia, which existed in Rome in the time of the Pannonian diocese of Methodius and probably influenced the formation of Slavic ethnogenetic legends through Cyril’s and Methodius’s cultural and ideological legacy. © 2023 Volgograd State University.

"Text Style Transfer (TST) evaluation is, in practice, inconsistent. Therefore, we conduct a meta-analysis on human and automated TST evaluation and experimentation that thoroughly examines existing literature in the field. The meta-analysis reveals a substantial standardization gap in human and automated evaluation. In addition, we also find a validation gap: only few automated metrics have been validated using human experiments. To this end, we thoroughly scrutinize both the standardization and validation gap and reveal the resulting pitfalls. This work also paves the way to close the standardization and validation gap in TST evaluation by calling out requirements to be met by future research. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Context: Despite the expansion of palliative care (PC) services, the public has little knowledge and holds misperceptions about PC, creating barriers to accessing timely specialty PC. Objectives: To systematically review the evidence regarding the efficacy of educational interventions to improve knowledge and attitudes about PC among nonhealthcare workers. Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CIANHL, Web of Science, and Scopus) for studies investigating educational interventions about specialty PC in adults who identified as patients, caregivers, or members of the public. We included studies that were available in English and had a comparator group. We excluded studies that only sampled health professionals or children. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess quality and risk of bias. Results: Of 12,420 records identified, we screened 5948 abstracts and assessed 526 full texts for eligibility. Twenty-one articles were extracted for analysis, representing 20 unique educational interventions. Common methodologies included quasi-experimental (9, 45%), randomized controlled trial (4, 20%), and nonrandomized trial (2, 10%). Common components of the educational interventions included video presentations (9, 45%), written materials (8, 40%), and lectures (4, 20%). Content included definition (14, 70%) and philosophy (14, 70%) of PC, distinctions between PC and hospice (11, 55%), and eligibility for PC (11, 55%). Fourteen (70%) interventions showed statistically significant positive differences in either knowledge or attitudes about PC. Conclusions: While educational interventions can positively impact knowledge and attitudes about PC among nonhealthcare workers, more research is needed to inform the design, delivery, and evaluation of interventions to increase knowledge and attitudes about PC. © 2023 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine"
"Background: Increasing numbers of primary care physicians (PCPs) are reducing their working hours. This decline may affect the workforce and the care provided to patients. Objectives: This scoping review aims to determine the impact of PCPs working part-time on quality of patient care. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Peer-reviewed, original articles with either quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods designs, published after 2000 and written in any language were considered. The search strings combined the two concepts: part-time work and primary care. Studies were included if they examined any effect of PCPs working part-time on quality of patient care. Results: The initial search resulted in 2,323 unique studies. Abstracts were screened, and information from full texts on the study design, part-time and quality of patient care was extracted. The final dataset included 14 studies utilising data from 1996 onward. The studies suggest that PCPs working part-time may negatively affect patient care, particularly the access and continuity of care domains. Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction seem mostly unaffected or even improved. Conclusion: There is evidence of both negative and positive effects of PCPs working part-time on quality of patient care. Approaches that mitigate negative effects of part-time work while maintaining positive effects should be implemented. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Structured daily drilling reports (DDRs) are a rich source of information that allows better planning, more accurate risk analysis, improved key performance indicators (KPIs), and contracts. However, such information is originally stored in a free-text and unstructured format, which becomes difficult for efficient data mining. With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies, particularly AI language models, applying such techniques over unstructured data became key in the digital transformation phenomenon. This paper presents an approach for automatic DDR classification, incorporating new techniques of artificial intelligence. The proposed classifier is already in use in Petrobras for offshore DDR classification. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference."
"The rising complexity of modern production systems raises the need for evaluating the code quality also in control software engineering. Complexity metrics can help identifying code that is difficult to maintain and may benefit from a refactoring. Although complexity metrics have already been adapted to the domain-specific languages (DSLs) used for cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs), literature on whether developers benefit from using these metrics is limited. Also, the complexity perception of code by the domain experts remains to be investigated. The perceived difficulty of comprehending a program can vary among developers and also between different implementation variants of the same functionality. We therefore asked industrial experts, who have experience in the respective DSLs, to rate the complexity of semantically equivalent implementations to find out which metric best represents their complexity perception and whether there are differences between implementation variants. The examples used in the study were inspired, in parts, by an open source library for IEC 61131-3. We found that the Cognitive Complexity metric is a useful representation of the software complexity in the domain, as it best matched the domain experts' perception of complexity. These metrics should therefore be supported by the analysis tools. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article reflects on the dynamics of relations between representation and representativeness based on the analysis of the visual composition of the character Rose Maxson in Fences (2016), by August Wilson. It is a partial result of a documentary research that examined the visual elements — hair, makeup and costumes — that express the idea of femininity and bring materiality to the black female character of Fences, both in the text of the play and in its adaptation to cinema, describing similarities, differences and possible absences of visuality description, analyzing the collected content according to the concept of Controlling Images, developed by Patricia Hill Collins. The study explores a field of articulation between language and culture, focusing on how textual and audiovisual productions construct the images of black female characters. It thus to problematizes the relations between the cultural industry and the reinforcement of social places assigned to racialized bodies. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

"Image captioning is an advanced NLP task that has various practical applications. To meet the requirement of visual information understanding and textual information generation, the encoder-decoder framework has been widely adopted by image captioning models. In this context, the encoder is responsible for transforming an image into vector representation, and the decoder acts as a text generator for yielding an image caption. It is obvious and intuitive that the decoder is crucial for the entire image captioning model. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies in which the impact of various aspects of the decoder on the image captioning is investigated. To advance the understanding of the impacts of text generation techniques employed by the decoder, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of three types of language models, two types of decoding strategies and two types of training methods, based on four state-of-the-art image captioning models. Our experimental results demonstrate that the language model affects the performance of image captioning models, while different language models may benefit different image captioning models. In addition, it is also revealed that among the decoding and training strategies under investigation, the beam search, AOA mechanism and the reinforcement learning based training method can generally improve the performance of image captioning models. Moreover, the results also show that the combinational usage of these strategies always outperforms the use of single strategy for the task of image captioning. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

"Introduction. One of the features of the Cold War was the movement of the rivalry of the superpowers into local armed conflicts and civil wars that took place on the territory of other states, mainly the Third World. The article examines the process of the involvement of the Soviet Union in the second half of the 1970s in the civil wars in Angola and Afghanistan. The policy of the USSR in armed conflicts outside the zone of its military-political influence has often been the subject of scientific research, but it has rarely been subjected to comparative analysis, and the authors make such an attempt, which is the novelty of the study. Methods and materials. The main method of the study is the method of comparative analysis (the actions of the USSR in 1975–1979 during the conflict in Angola and Soviet actions in the same period in Afghanistan are compared); the authors rely on documents, memoirs, and previous scientific works. Analysis. The first part of the article examines the process of the USSR’s involvement in the civil war in Angola, which began there soon after gaining independence, from the diplomatic recognition of the People’s Republic of Angola to the dispatch of Soviet military specialists. The second part of the article is devoted to the development of events in Afghanistan after the April 1978 revolution and Soviet involvement in them. Results. The authors conclude that the line adopted by the Soviet Union in relation to the military confrontation in Angola (financial, military, and other assistance, the dispatch of weapons, and military specialists) was ultimately more successful than the line implemented in relation to the civil war in Afghanistan in the form of direct military intervention by the Soviet army and its participation in the conflict outside the country. Authors contribution. T.V. Rabush described and analyzed the development of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Angola and with Afghanistan. R.A. Solovyev examined the military aspects of Soviet-Angolan and Soviet-Afghan cooperation (supply of weapons, sending military advisers, etc.).

"In recent years, research in text summarization has mainly focused on the news domain, where texts are typically short and have strong layout features. The task of full-book summarization presents additional challenges which are hard to tackle with current resources, due to their limited size and availability in English only. To overcome these limitations, we present “Echoes from Alexandria”, or in shortened form, ""Echoes"", a large resource for multilingual book summarization. Echoes features three novel datasets: i) Echo-Wiki, for multilingual book summarization, ii) Echo-XSum, for extremely-compressive multilingual book summarization, and iii) Echo-FairySum, for extractive book summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Echoes - with its thousands of books and summaries - is the largest resource, and the first to be multilingual, featuring 5 languages and 25 language pairs. In addition to Echoes, we also introduce a new extractive-then-abstractive baseline, and, supported by our experimental results and manual analysis of the summaries generated, we argue that this baseline is more suitable for book summarization than purely-abstractive approaches. We release our resource and software at https://github.com/Babelscape/echoes-from-alexandria in the hope of fostering innovative research in multilingual book summarization. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Placing contemporary representations of subjective experiences of childbirth at the centre of the analysis, the article examines birth scenes in Inga Gaile's novel Stikli (Glass Shards, 2016) and Anna Auziņa's novel Mājoklis. Terēze’s dienasgrāmata (The Dwelling. Terēze’s Diary, 2021). While Gaile explores experimental writing and rhythm to articulate natural birth from the immediacy of an embodied experience, Auziņa portrays the experience of giving birth in hospital, where birth is reduced to a sequence of medical procedures and the birthing woman's agency is erased, with the retrospective storytelling becoming a way of recovering the agency. The different circumstances portrayed present childbirth as a completely different experience, yet by focusing on the subjective and embodied perspective of the woman giving birth, both texts challenge the previous taboo of talking about the maternal body and disrupt the cultural beliefs about childbirth that erase the subjectivity of the birthing woman. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), text classification is an important task. Current techniques for text classification tasks still need development, however, because of the complex abstraction of text semantic information and the considerable impact of context. This research synthesizes the strengths of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of neural networks. The LSTM-CNN hybrid model is a combination of the two models: the LSTM-generated text feature vector is then extracted using the CNN structure. The Bi-LSTM can retain long text sequences while taking into account the importance of the whole text, and it can subsequently use the organizational principles of the CNN to extract local text features. The research's experiment compares the effectiveness of the LSTM-CNN, the Bi-LSTM, and the Random Forest (RF) in a sentiment analysis project based on the ternary classification (Neutral, Positive, and Negative) of the metaverse, which can be described as a virtual reality space where individuals can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users in real-time, related topics. From what can be gathered from this research experiments, the LSTM-CNN outperforms other models when it comes to boosting text classification accuracy and achieving lower loss.  © 2023 IEEE."
"As aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks (ABSA) continue to evolve, end-to-end ABSA tasks (E2E-ABSA) are emerging as a new research direction. Most models for this type of task obtain valid classification features from syntactic and semantic information of the text, but the commonly used syntactic dependency trees ignore the direction of word dependencies when generating syntactic information. To resolve this problem, a combined model of Bi-directional Graph Convolutional Network incorporating Attention Mechanisms (Bi-ATGCN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, Bert is used as a pre-training model to obtain dynamic word vectors containing contextual information. Secondly, a directed syntactic dependency tree is introduced, and the syntactic information of the text is captured using the Bi-directional Graph Convolutional Network (Bi-GCN), and the dependency relationship between words is optimized by fusing Attention Mechanism when generating the adjacency matrix of Bi-ATGCN. Finally, the contextual semantic information of the text is captured using Bi-LSTM and thus better perform the E2E-ABSA task. The classification performance of the combined model is improved when compared with related benchmark model experiments on LAPTOP and REST datasets. © 2023 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation."
"The ability of the European community to respond to the multiple crises threatening the European Union and Europe depends in part on citizens' shared European identity giving legitimacy and support to communal action. Men's elite European club football is an example of a cultural practice that is highly Europeanised, reaches diverse audiences and is a known carrier of collective identities. This article examines the emergence of a European public football sphere through the convergence of football coverage across national media spaces, serving as a foundation for European identity constructions. It connects the concept of a European public sphere to the Europeanisation and mediatisation of football and its potential effects on European identity formation. Results indicate a convergence of football coverage around high-profile and high-status aspects of European football, creating a strongly aligned, homogenous but exclusive European public football sphere that leaves many parts of Europe on the sidelines. © 2023 The Authors.

"Thirty years of existence of independent Czechia are connected with growing cross-border cooperation (CBC) with neighboring states and decreasing importance of national borders. The accession to the EU meant a giant leap towards de-bordering, which was recently disrupted by a few crises. CBC, represented primarily by Euroregions, has its specifics in each analyzed border region. In the text, based on long-term research of CBC in the Czech borderlands, literature review, statistical data analysis, and own qualitative research, we look at the institutional dimension of cross-border integration and propose measuring the performance of Euroregions while focusing on their (INTERREG-funded) projects and the existence of functional working groups assisting in eliminating border barriers. The developed matrix singles out three groups of the Euroregions in the Czech borderlands with different levels of institutional activity. © Geografický ústav SAV."
"It is common sense that it is better to prevent than cure. The same applies to oil & gas industry, which stakeholders have recently coined the expression ‘learn from normal work’ to highlight that there are other ways rather only learning from accidentes. The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) has recently issued a report showing how to implement the concept in the oil & gas installations (IOGP, 2023). The Energy Institute (EI) has chosen to call the concept ‘learning before incidentes’, and has also issued some material, including videos (EI, 2022). The IOGP guideline points several tools to learn from normal work. Two of them are frequently requested and assessed by the brazilian oil and gas regulator (ANP) auditors during their safety audits: Walk-through (or VCP – verification of conformities with procedures) and the human reliability analysis. The human reliability analysis is a methodology that proposes to systematically consider human factors in risk analysis. By not adopting a method to consider the context in which the workforce is inserted, risk analysis participants tend to issue opinions based only on common sense (Raio et al., 2018). Validated human reliability analysis methods are a better option because they were created by engineers, psychologists and sociologists and consider data from scientific experiments on how human error can be triggered by various factors in the context of the task performed (Kirwan, 2017). In the Brazilian oil industry, the human reliability analysis methodology is still not used on a large scale. Although clearly stated by ISO 31010 as the right technique to assess human factors in risk analysis, the failure to use it might be possibly due to the lack of knowledge dissemination or clarity in safety regulation which stated that ‘the methodology of risk analysis should consider human factors’ (ANP, 2007). This has prompted the regulator to change the text in the new regulation still under public consultation (ANP, 2022). Usually, in existing installations, the probability of human error is considered when using the LOPA (layer of protection analysis) methodology (Willey, 2014), which considers the human error probability fixed and immutable, when the most appropriate would be to consider the probability according to the task performed and the context in which the worker is inserted. This relationship between context and task factors that can influence human performance is the most important basis of all human reliability analysis methods (those accepted by safety regulatory bodies and scientifically validated). Popular and scientifically acceptable methods can be found in the publication of the UK safety regulator, HSE (Bell & Holroyd, 2009). The methods with the greatest potential for application in the oil and gas industry, according to the criteria used by (Ramos et al., 2020), are (in order of greatest suitability for the oil and gas industry): Phoenix-PRO (high suitability), Petro-HRA (high), CREAM (high), SPAR-H (medium), HEART (medium), ATHEANA (medium) and THERP (low). © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference."
"This paper is devoted to the study of phraseological units as parts of the system and the discourse of a literary character's linguistic personality. As the practical material under study were chosen N. Teffi's short stories Strong as Death, Easter Child, and Causes and Consequences, which mark different stages of the writer's oeuvre. The aim of the research was the identification of Teffi's main strategies with regard to the forms of verbal production as well as providing a description of the function of phraseological units depending on the possible intentions and types of the speaking subject. The analysis is made in accordance with the way in which phraseologisms were distributed through the composition and speech structures of the chosen texts. Teffi uses a unique set of strategies in each of the stories. For instance, texts with the dominance of author's monologue tend to dissolve the author into the character's conscious or to hide the author behind a mask. In that case, idioms generally utilize the double set of strategies for both the ""surface"" and the ""deep"" sender. Moreover, the research has revealed a correlation between the feuilleton aesthetics of a particular story and the usage of externalized metaphors on which idioms are based. By rejecting the publicistic style, Teffi turned to more elusive and subtle language game, so clarity of her techniques was replaced by playing with grammatical meanings at first. As it is shown in the paper, this strategy is used in the story Strong as Death, where the authorial intent is supported by the aspectual modification of the idiom. The paper states that in the discourse of the narrator's and the literary character's linguistic personality, phraseology pursues different objectives. For example, in order to reveal the ""deep"" sender's intentions, idioms can actualize some precedential texts, introduce another type of discourse into the story, and arrange its concept sphere and architectonics. In this regard, it was proposed that idioms can function as symbols (in V. Vinogradov's sense). Phraseological units take part in making up stylistic oppositions and can serve as means of both exposing the character and creating a comical effect. The paper aims to synthesize the results obtained during the analysis of text's actual linguistic component and discourse practices in their correlations with composition and speech structures. The analysis is carried out taking into account the genre features (public lecture, first-person narrative, and feuilleton) as well as the communicative tactics of the narrator and the characters. © 2023 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

"Entities can be expressed in diverse formats, such as texts, images, or column names and cell values in tables. While existing entity linking (EL) models work well on per modality configuration, such as text-only EL, visual grounding, or schema linking, it is more challenging to design a unified model for diverse modality configurations. To bring various modality configurations together, we constructed a benchmark for diverse-modal EL (DMEL) from existing EL datasets, covering all three modalities including text, image, and table. To approach the DMEL task, we proposed a generative diverse-modal model (GDMM) following a multimodal-encoder-decoder paradigm. Pre-training GDMM with rich corpora builds a solid foundation for DMEL without storing the entire KB for inference. Fine-tuning GDMM builds a stronger DMEL baseline, outperforming state-of-the-art task-specific EL models by 8.51 F1 score on average. Additionally, extensive error analyses are conducted to highlight the challenges of DMEL, facilitating future research on this task. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Cutting-edge image generation has been praised for producing high-quality images, suggesting a ubiquitous future in a variety of applications. However, initial studies have pointed to the potential for harm due to predictive bias, reflecting and potentially reinforcing cultural stereotypes. In this work, we are the first to investigate how multimodal models handle diverse gender identities. Concretely, we conduct a thorough analysis in which we compare the output of three image generation models for prompts containing cisgender vs. non-cisgender identity terms. Our findings demonstrate that certain non-cisgender identities are consistently (mis)represented as less human, more stereotyped and more sexualised. We complement our experimental analysis with (a) a survey among non-cisgender individuals and (b) a series of interviews, to establish which harms affected individuals anticipate, and how they would like to be represented. We find respondents are particularly concerned about misrepresentation, and the potential to drive harmful behaviours and beliefs. Simple heuristics to limit offensive content are widely rejected, and instead respondents call for community involvement, curated training data and the ability to customise. These improvements could pave the way for a future where change is led by the affected community, and technology is used to positively “[portray] queerness in ways that we haven't even thought of” rather than reproducing stale, offensive stereotypes. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Background: Ivabradine improves cardiac function in patients with heart failure, but its effect on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ivabradine's effect on cardiac function and prognosis in patients with DCM. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and four registers through September 28, 2022. All controlled trials of ivabradine for the treatment of DCM with congestive heart failure were included. Articles were limited to English, with the full text and necessary data available. We performed random- or fixed effects meta-analyses for all included outcome measures and compared the effect sizes for outcomes in patients treated with and without ivabradine. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2.0). Findings: Five trials with 357 participants were included. The pooled risk ratio was 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.18, 1.25)] for all-cause mortality and 0.38 [95% CI (0.12, 1.23)] for cardiac mortality. The pooled mean difference was −15.95 [95% CI (−19.97, −11.92)] for resting heart rate, 3.96 [95% CI (0.99, 6.93)] for systolic blood pressure, 2.93 [95% CI (2.09, 3.77)] for left ventricular ejection fraction, −5.90 [95% CI (−9.36, −2.44)] for left ventricular end-systolic diameter, −3.41 [95% CI (−5.24, −1.58)] for left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, −0.81 [95% CI (−1.00, −0.62)] for left ventricular end-systolic volume, −0.67 [95% CI (−0.86, −0.48)] for left ventricular end-diastolic volume, −11.01 [95% CI (−19.66, −2.35)] for Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score, and −0.52 [95% CI (−0.73, −0.31)] for New York Heart Association class. Interpretation: Ivabradine reduces heart rate and ventricular volume, and improves cardiac function in patients with DCM, but showed no significant effect on the prognosis of patients. 2023 Yang, Lv, Zhou, Lin, Zhao, Lou, Liu, Zhang, Guo and Chi."

"This paper investigates the use of standard and non-standard adverbial markers in modern Chinese literature. In Chinese, adverbials can be derived from many adjectives, adverbs and verbs with the suffix “de”. The suffix has a standard and a non-standard written form, both of which are frequently used. Contrastive research on these two competing forms has mostly been qualitative or limited to small text samples. In this first large-scale quantitative study, we present statistics on 346 adverbial types from an 8-million-character text corpus drawn from Chinese literature in the 20th century. We present a semantic analysis of the verbs modified by adverbs with standard and non-standard markers, and a chronological analysis of marker choice among six prominent modern Chinese authors. We show that the non-standard form is more frequently used when the adverbial modifies an emotion verb. Further, we demonstrate that marker choice is correlated to text genre and register, as well as the writing style of the author. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"With the progression of deep-learning techniques, digital media recording and synthesis media generation have become exceptionally easy. Due to open access of user-friendly deepfaking applications generated using Artificial Intelligence methods especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs), synthesis of recorded media has been made more effortless. Digital media synthesized using such applications is termed as deepfake. Generation of realistic fake audio/video content poses critical threats to an individual and society at large. To curb the threat of deepfaking, numerous deepfake detection algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a survey on state-of-the-art deepfake generation techniques, categorized into face swap, attribute manipulation, and lip-sync manipulation. An analysis of some recently developed techniques that can generate images from text is also presented in the proposed paper. In addition, state-of-art image and video datasets released in the domain of deepfake detection are also discussed. The analysis provided in this survey reveals that every new deepfake generation technique calls for the development of novel deepfake detection techniques. Among deepfake detection techniques proposed so far, MobileNet-CNN model, multi-scale temporal CNN model, and GAN-based technique outperform good for face swap, lip-syncing, and attribute manipulation detection with an accuracy of 99.28%, 97.1%,and 100%, respectively. This survey would help researchers to understand the literature on deepfake generation and detection which is required for future development in this field. © 2023 Mansi Rehaan, Nirmal Kaur and Staffy Kingra."
"Purpose: This study investigates the key factors that influence customer satisfaction when interacting with augmented reality shopping assistance applications (ARSAPs). ARSAPs grant consumers the capability to experience products in a virtually simulated user environment before product acquisition. With the development of mobile e-commerce due to breakthroughs in smartphone and augmented reality (AR) technologies, there is an increasing potential for these emergent AR mobile services, yet there is a need for further improvement. Design/methodology/approach: This study initially explored the key satisfaction factors for ARSAPs by utilizing topic modeling of a collection of actual user reviews. These factors are subsequently revisited and complemented by existing literature, and finally verified through logistic regression analysis supported by sentiment analysis. Findings: This study identified the key factors that influence customer satisfaction with ARSAPs, including visuality, sense of reality, credibility, format, completeness, understandability, relevance, flexibility, response time, reliability, availability, ease of use and privacy. In particular, two additional factors (i.e. visuality and sense of reality) were newly identified as important in the context of AR, despite their previous omissions in existing literature. Originality/value: This study is the first to investigate the key factors that influence customer satisfaction with ARSAPs from users' perspectives, utilizing topic modeling of a large amount of real-world data on actual user feedback. By identifying new factors (i.e. visuality and sense of reality) that were not identified in previous literature, this study provides important academic implications for a broader understanding of AR and related technologies that are essential elements of the metaverse. This study also provides valuable insights for developers and companies in the e-commerce industry on how to optimize AR applications and develop more targeted and effective marketing strategies in this field. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"We introduce NaSGEC, a new dataset to facilitate research on Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) for native speaker texts from multiple domains. Previous CGEC research primarily focuses on correcting texts from a single domain, especially learner essays. To broaden the target domain, we annotate multiple references for 12,500 sentences from three native domains, i.e., social media, scientific writing, and examination. We provide solid benchmark results for NaSGEC by employing cutting-edge CGEC models and different training data. We further perform detailed analyses of the connections and gaps between our domains from both empirical and statistical views. We hope this work can inspire future studies on an important but under-explored direction-cross-domain GEC. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Web documents have become rich data resources in current era, and understanding their discourse structure will potentially benefit various downstream document processing applications. Unfortunately, current discourse analysis and document intelligence research mostly focus on either discourse structure of plain text or superficial visual structures in document, which cannot accurately describe discourse structure of highly free-styled and semi-structured web documents. To promote discourse studies on web documents, in this paper we introduced a benchmark - WebDP, orienting a new task named Web Document Discourse Parsing. Specifically, a web document discourse structure representation schema is proposed by extending classical discourse theories and adding special features to well represent discourse characteristics of web documents. Then, a manually annotated web document dataset -WEBDOCS is developed to facilitate the study of this parsing task. We compared current neural models on WEBDOCS and experimental results show that WebDP is feasible but also challenging for current models. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"While CLIP models are useful for zero-shot vision-and-language (VL) tasks or computer vision tasks, little attention has been paid to the application of CLIP for language tasks. Intuitively, CLIP model have a rich representation pre-trained with natural language supervision, in which we argue that it is useful for language tasks. Hence, this work bridge this gap by investigating a CLIP model for zero-shot text classification. Specifically, we introduce CLIPTEXT, a novel paradigm for zero-shot text classification, which reformulates zero-shot text classification into a text-image matching problem that CLIP can be applied to. In addition, we further incorporate prompt into CLIPTEXT (PROMPT-CLIPTEXT) to better derive knowledge from CLIP. Experimental results on seven publicly available zero-shot text classification datasets show that both CLIPTEXT and PROMPT-CLIPTEXT attain promising performance. Besides, extensive analysis further verifies that knowledge from CLIP can benefit zero-shot text classification task. We hope this work can attract more breakthroughs on applying VL pre-trained models for language tasks. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Hierarchical text classification (HTC) focuses on classifying one text into multiple labels, which are organized as a hierarchical taxonomy. Due to its wide involution in realistic scenarios, HTC attracts long-term attention from both industry and academia. However, the high cost of hierarchical multi-label annotation makes HTC suffer from the data scarcity problem. In view of the difficulty in balancing the controllability of multiple structural labels and text diversity, automatically generating high-quality data for HTC is challenging and under-explored. To fill this blank, we propose a novel data generation framework tailored for HTC, which can achieve both label controllability and text diversity by extracting high-quality semantic-level and phrase-level hierarchical label information. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with existing data augmentation methods, the data generated from our method can bring the most significant performance improvements of several strong HTC models. Extensive analysis confirms that the improvements yielded by our proposed method do correlate to the enhancement of label controllability and text diversity. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In text summarization, extractivity is defined as a measurement of the degree of overlap between a source document and its summary. Previous research has shown that the extractivity level of training data can influence both output extractivity and the amount of factual information (i.e. faithfulness) in outputs for abstractive summarization. However, it remains unclear if and how extractivity impacts the performance of abstractive models. In this work, we investigate the relationship between dataset extractivity and model performance by comparing the performance of trained models under different degrees of extractivity. We find that while low levels of extractivity can improve performance, as extractivity increases, performance is negatively impacted. Furthermore, through an analysis of the model's copy continuity of content, we discover that higher extractivity leads to a greater tendency for the model to copy text continuously from the source document rather than identifying and summarizing important content that should be covered in the target summary. To address these issues, we propose a simple and effective method to design copy labels for fixing the model's copying behaviors and train the model with a copy mechanism. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy in alleviating the negative impact on model performance resulting from high dataset extractivity, and that our method outperforms several competitive baselines. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Statement of problem: As the use of traditional posts has been associated with complications and failure outcomes, the introduction of novel materials and minimally invasive dentistry has shifted toward the use of composite resin post-and-core restorations for endodontically treated teeth. As a further process, to improve stress absorption environment in restored teeth, the invention of short fiber-reinforced composite resins (SFRCs) as post-and-core restorations has recently emerged. However, evidence regarding its performance is still scarce, and a synthesis of existing data is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the performance of SFRC post-and-core restorations, regarding fracture resistance and failure mode and considering both cyclic and static loading. Material and methods: An electronic search in 5 databases was conducted up to August 2022, and the protocol of the study was registered a priori. The search terms included “fiber reinforced composite,” “core build-up,” and “post.” Studies were considered if they compared SFRC restorations with other types of conventional posts and teeth restored using bulk fill composite resin. The internal validity of the studies was assessed by using a custom-made risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 1271 records were identified, of which 13 were considered for full-text assessment. Eight were ultimately included, all being in vitro studies, and 7 of them were deemed eligible for quantitative syntheses. The results varied considerably across studies with divergent fracture resistance values and percentages of catastrophic failure being reported. Standard depth (6 mm) SFRCs presented fewer repetitions until fracture on average, compared with the individually made FRCs (3 studies: mean difference (MD): −4062; 95% CI: −6148, −1975; P<.001) under cyclic loading. Under static loading, SFRCs (standard depth) presented a nearly 300 N lower fracture force compared with that of intact teeth, (3 studies: MD: −297; 95%CI: −378, −216; P<.001). Conclusions: Evidence on the laboratory fracture and failure performance of SFRCs is limited, and future studies should incorporate more standardized experimental conditions, as well as SFRCs with limited sacrifice of tooth substrate within the root canal of endodontically treated teeth. © 2023 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry"
"The ongoing debate on the necessity of EU legislation on gender balanced company boards gives rise to interesting questions in respect of the concepts of equality and subsidiarity. After the Council recently reached a common position on the matter, the renewed topicality of the draft directive of 2012 is cause for an analysis of both the original and amended draft text in view of these concepts. Do the originally proposed quota measures for private company boards meet the requirements of the principles of equality and subsidiarity? Following an analysis of the changes to the directive as proposed by the Council, this contribution will successively review in what manner controversies appear to have been addressed and with what probable implications for the directive’s effectiveness. © 2023 The Author(s).

"This article analyses the image of David as an exorcist. The choice of the research topic has been inspired by the fact that in the literature, more specifically, in an article by Kenneth E. Pomykala, this issue is presented in a very general way, by indicating only texts where such an image of David can be found, without entering into their deeper interpretations. Also, no scientific article covering this topic in detail has been published to date. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part presents biblical texts in which - as Pomykala has proven - one can talk about this characteristic of David. In the second part, fragments of two Qumran manuscripts, 11Q5 and 11Q11, are analysed. Finally, an analysis of the literature of early Jewish writings, portraying David as an exorcist, is provided. © 2023 Institute of Biblical Studies - Faculty of Theology. All rights reserved."
"Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA) is one of the main subtasks of sentiment analysis, which aims at predicting polarity over a given aspect category. Recently, generative methods have emerged as an efficient way to use a pre-trained language model for ACSA. However, those methods fail to model relations between target words and opinion words in a sentence including multiple aspects. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a method to incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which describes the semantic representation of a sentence as a directed graph, into a text generation model. Furthermore, two regularizers are designed to guide the allocation of cross attention weights over AMR graphs. One is the identical regularizer, which constrains the attention weights of aligned nodes, the other is the entropy regularizer, which helps the decoder generate tokens by only giving a high degree of consideration to a few related nodes in the AMR graph. Experimental results on three datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, proving the effectiveness of our model. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This paper explores methods for extracting information from radiology reports that generalize across exam modalities to reduce requirements for annotated data. We demonstrate that multi-pass T5-based text-to-text generative models exhibit better generalization across exam modalities compared to approaches that employ BERT-based task-specific classification layers. We then develop methods that reduce the inference cost of the model, making largescale corpus processing more feasible for clinical applications. Specifically, we introduce a generative technique that decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtask blocks, which improves a single-pass model when combined with multitask training. In addition, we leverage target-domain contexts during inference to enhance domain adaptation, enabling use of smaller models. Analyses offer insights into the benefits of different cost reduction strategies.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"End-to-end Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (EASA) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves extracting aspect terms and identifying the sentiments for them, which provides a fine-grained level of text analysis and thus requires a deep understanding of the running text. Many previous studies leverage advanced text encoders to extract context information and use syntactic information, e.g., the dependency structure of the input sentence, to improve the model performance. However, such models may reach a bottleneck since the dependency structure is not designed to provide semantic information of the text, which is also important for identifying the sentiment and thus leave room for further improvement. Considering that combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) is a formalism that expresses both syntactic and semantic information of a sentence, it has the potential to be beneficial to EASA. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve EASA with CCG supertags, which carry the syntactic and semantic information of the associated words and serve as the most important part of the CCG derivation. Specifically, our approach proposes a CCG supertag decoding process to learn the syntactic and semantic information carried by CCG supertags and use the information to guide the attention over the input words so as to identify important contextual information for EASA. Furthermore, a gate mechanism is used in incorporating the weighted contextual information into the backbone EASA decoding process. We evaluate our approach on three publicly available English datasets for EASA, and show that it outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Metric Differential Privacy is a generalization of differential privacy tailored to address the unique challenges of text-to-text privatization. By adding noise to the representation of words in the geometric space of embeddings, words are replaced with words located in the proximity of the noisy representation. Since embeddings are trained based on word co-occurrences, this mechanism ensures that substitutions stem from a common semantic context. Without considering the grammatical category of words, however, this mechanism cannot guarantee that substitutions play similar syntactic roles. We analyze the capability of text-to-text privatization to preserve the grammatical category of words after substitution and find that surrogate texts consist almost exclusively of nouns. Lacking the capability to produce surrogate texts that correlate with the structure of the sensitive texts, we encompass our analysis by transforming the privatization step into a candidate selection problem in which substitutions are directed to words with matching grammatical properties. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in the performance of downstream tasks by up to 4.66% while retaining comparative privacy guarantees. © 2023 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

"Tasks involving text generation based on multiple input texts, such as multi-document summarization, long-form question answering and contemporary dialogue applications, challenge models for their ability to properly consolidate partly-overlapping multi-text information. However, these tasks entangle the consolidation phase with the often subjective and ill-defined content selection requirement, impeding proper assessment of models' consolidation capabilities. In this paper, we suggest revisiting the sentence union generation task as an effective well-defined testbed for assessing text consolidation capabilities, decoupling the consolidation challenge from subjective content selection. To support research on this task, we present refined annotation methodology and tools for crowdsourcing sentence union, create the largest union dataset to date and provide an analysis of its rich coverage of various consolidation aspects. We then propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for union generation, including both human and automatic evaluation. Finally, as baselines, we evaluate state-of-the-art language models on the task, along with a detailed analysis of their capacity to address multi-text consolidation challenges and their limitations. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The article explores various films “about Eastern life” of the 1920s, conducting a historical and anthropological analysis of the content of these films and their reviews from the perspective of intercultural communication. The research methodology is grounded in the semiotic tradition and the communicative model proposed by Yu. M. Lotman. Printed media texts and visual sources (films) were used in the composition of this article. The aim of this piece is to expose the communicative functions of cinematography as a medium for information exchange and to ascertain the cognitive possibilities of silent cinema for the communicative interaction of the peoples of our country. Films “from Eastern life” had to conform to certain criteria, taking into account the idiosyncrasies of the national mentality of the inhabitants of the eastern outskirts. The study revealed that legends were employed in scriptwriting as a phenomenon of folk spiritual culture. Films inspired by folklore depict architectural masterpieces and the diverse nature of different regions. The harem theme popular in Western Europe found its way into Soviet films “about Eastern life”, but the quest for the “false exotic of the East” often resulted in communication breakdowns. The “inauthentic” portrayal of the East did not resonate with viewers and film critics. Nevertheless, silent films of the 1920s introduced the ethno-confessional characteristics of peoples, their history, traditional way of life, mores, and customs. These films contributed to the broadening of the national worldview, thereby confirming the high cognitive potential and significance of cinema in the intercultural communication within the multi-ethnic landscape of the USSR. © 2023.

"Diffusion models developed on top of powerful text-to-image generation models like Stable Diffusion achieve remarkable success in visual story generation. However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios. We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Background: Adherence to self-management greatly impacts patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. However, most patients with COPD have a limitation in understanding text-based self-management plans owing to low health literacy. Thus, strategies to improve self-management in patients with COPD should be developed. Objectives: This study aimed to develop pictogram-based content comprising self-management health information for patients with COPD. Methods: Items for COPD self-management health information were selected based on in-depth interviews with patients and text network analysis conducted in our previous study and a systematic literature review to develop preliminary pictogram-based content. Then, 30 patients with COPD and 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs) were recruited to evaluate the preliminary content using a client satisfaction questionnaire with a maximum score of 32. Results: Content was developed with one item related to disease knowledge while the other 20 concerned self-management. Patients (28.70 ± 2.94) and HCPs (27.40 ± 2.84) evaluated the content as high quality with adjustments made to increase the size of the letters and shorten the number of items for readability. Twenty-one items were collated in the final booklet, while 14 of the 21 items were incorporated into a poster. Conclusions: This study indicates that the pictogram-based content was sufficiently well designed and received good evaluations from both patients with COPD and HCPs. Therefore, it may have prospects for enhancing self-management in patients with COPD. However, the effect of the content on the outcomes of older patients with COPD and low health literacy will need to be validated in future research. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"We present a pipeline for a statistical textual exploration, offering a stylometry-based explanation and statistical validation of a hypothesized partition of a text. Given a parameterization of the text, our pipeline: (1) detects literary features yielding the optimal overlap between the hypothesized and unsupervised partitions, (2) performs a hypothesis-testing analysis to quantify the statistical significance of the optimal overlap, while conserving implicit correlations between units of text that are more likely to be grouped, and (3) extracts and quantifies the importance of features most responsible for the classification, estimates their statistical stability and cluster-wise abundance. We apply our pipeline to the first two books in the Bible, where one stylistic component stands out in the eyes of biblical scholars, namely, the Priestly component. We identify and explore statistically significant stylistic differences between the Priestly and non-Priestly components. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In this article we engage with the representation of non-binary gender in two sci-fi/fantasy comics (Runaways and The Order of the Stick), and metatextual discussion surrounding them. In our analysis we focus on how non-binary gender is represented, and ways in which the comics reveal implicit anxieties around non/human characters who are non-binary. The idea that non-binary gender is ‘hiding’ a true, binary, gender is present within and beyond the text: rather than accepting these characters’ non-binary gender as a fact of their species within the narrative, it is treated a puzzle to be solved. We explore how texts, and fans, focus upon the body and subsequently sexuality as a locus of gender ‘truth’, even though as drawings these bodies cannot be further revealed beyond the page or screen. We argue these comics ‘confuse’ gender in different ways: at times by purposefully confounding the possibility of pinpointing a ‘true’ binary gender for non-binary characters, while at others taking a more conservative path of displacing such ‘confusion’ onto the non-binary characters themselves to imply that it is they who are ‘confused’–while reflecting broader social patterns, this characterizes non-binary gender as though it were not a valid way of being. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Early detection and automated classification of dementia has recently gained considerable attention using neuroimaging data and spontaneous speech. In this paper, we explore the problem of dementia detection with in-hospital clinical notes. We collected 954 patients' clinical notes from a local hospital in Melbourne and assign dementia/non-dementia labels to those patients based on clinical assessment and telephone interview. Given the labeled dementia data sets, we fine tune a ClinicalBioBERT using filtered clinical notes and conducted experiments on both binary and three class dementia classification. Our experiment results show that the fine tuned ClinicalBioBERT achieved satisfied performance on binary classification but performed poorly on three class dementia classification. We explore the difficulties we encountered applying ClinicalBioBERT to hospital text. Further analysis suggests that more human prior knowledge should be considered.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Multimodal learning aims to imitate human beings to acquire complementary information from multiple modalities for various downstream tasks. However, traditional aggregation-based multimodal fusion methods ignore the inter-modality relationship, treat each modality equally, suffer sensor noise, and thus reduce multimodal learning performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal contrastive method to explore more reliable multimodal representations under the weak supervision of unimodal predicting. Specifically, we first capture task-related unimodal representations and the unimodal predictions from the introduced unimodal predicting task. Then the unimodal representations are aligned with the more effective one by the designed multimodal contrastive method under the supervision of the unimodal predictions. Experimental results with fused features on two image-text classification benchmarks UPMC-Food-101 and N24News show that our proposed Unimodality-Supervised MultiModal Contrastive (UniS-MMC) learning method outperforms current state-of-the-art multimodal methods. The detailed ablation study and analysis further demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Rhetorical Structure Theory implies no single discourse interpretation of a text, and the limitations of RST parsers further exacerbate inconsistent parsing of similar structures. Therefore, it is important to take into account that the same argumentative structure can be found in semantically similar texts with varying rhetorical structures. In this work, the differences between paraphrases within the same argument scheme are evaluated from a rhetorical perspective. The study proposes a deep dependency parsing model to assess the connection between rhetorical and argument structures. The model utilizes rhetorical relations; RST structures of paraphrases serve as training data augmentations. The method allows for end-to-end argumentation analysis using a rhetorical tree instead of a word sequence. It is evaluated on the bilingual Microtexts corpus, and the first results on fully-fledged argument parsing for the Russian version of the corpus are reported. The results suggest that argument mining can benefit from multiple variants of discourse structure. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"The paper presents a semantic analysis of the lexemes strast’ (passion) and prelest’ (fascination). A large body of material (1800–2020) has been extracted by continuous sampling from the National Corpus of the Russian Language. The functioning of the lexical units in question is compared in terms of the Russian world picture transformation in the texts of two periods: 1800–1959 and 1960–2020. The analysis examines the structures strast’ + k + Dat. and prelest’ + Gen. These historically derived nouns have been found to have similar semantic features, namely, negative evaluation components. Both periods witness strast’ being viewed as a subject of action (agent) and a person being perceived as a patient being led by strast’. During the first period, strast’ is conceptualized as a strong feeling that cannot be controlled, while during the second period, it is perceived rather as ultimately insuperable. The semantics of the word prelest’ in both periods involves the idea of seduction being stronger associated with the physical attraction to women during the second period. A corpus analysis of the most frequent context prelest’ zhizni has revealed the speakers’ attitude to change from the elevated one to ironic and sarcastic. Moreover, within the second period, prelest’ begins to be perceived as hypocrisy. In summary, the study has revealed that strast’ came to be understood as torture over time, while prelest’ was increasingly associated with the concept of deceit. © 2023 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology.

"Competent L2 writing has been described in research in terms of an increasing incidence, variety, and length of clauses; a countervailing compactness and tightness with reduced number of clauses even as clause length expands; and various interrelationships between syntactic realizations of texts and the genres they represent. These partly contradictory features are typically related to the fact that “advancedness” is both a notoriously vague term and a developmental stage that is more expansive than are introductory and intermediate levels of L2 performance. To contribute to a more differentiated understanding of advancedness—particularly its gradual development in instructed settings—this article examines the characteristics of advanced writing through an analysis of data that are (a) longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, (b) embedded in an instructional environment that has implemented principled, articulated curricular, and pedagogical practices for the development of advancedness, and (c) analyzed within a systemic–functional linguistic framework in order to focus on the notions of experiential and logical meaning. By analyzing the intraclausal and interclausal resources that evolving advanced learners use and by relating them to the learners’ developmental trajectory, this article contributes to a better understanding not only of the nature of advancedness but also of its development by adult instructed learners. © 2023 National Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations."
"The task of textual geolocation - retrieving the coordinates of a place based on a free-form language description - calls for not only grounding but also natural language understanding and geospatial reasoning. Even though there are quite a few datasets in English used for geolocation, they are currently based on open-source data (Wikipedia and Twitter), where the location of the described place is mostly implicit, such that the location retrieval resolution is limited. Furthermore, there are no datasets available for addressing the problem of textual geolocation in morphologically rich and resource-poor languages, such as Hebrew. In this paper, we present the Hebrew Geo-Location (HeGeL) corpus, designed to collect literal place descriptions and analyze lingual geospatial reasoning. We crowdsourced 5,649 literal Hebrew place descriptions of various place types in three cities in Israel. Qualitative and empirical analysis show that the data exhibits abundant use of geospatial reasoning and requires a novel environmental representation. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The article offers an overview of miracles in the lives of Novgorod tradition, mainly of the late Middle Ages and early Modern times. Miracles, which are often the main dating feature of the life (vita) edition, are often considered as a kind of “auxiliary” part of a hagiographic work, sometimes breaking out of the general context by stylistic or compositional features. However, along with the development of hagiographic genre, the assessment of miracles by the scribes themselves also changes. Miracles not only become central episodes of hagiographic texts or cycles (as in the case of Nikola Kochanov or the Alfanov brothers, as well as the more ancient life of John of Novgorod); the mode of depicting miraculous events itself changes: it shifts from the figure of saint to those with whom miracles are performed. The number of miracles increases many times, the actual information about the miraculous events that took place is detailed (where they occurred, when (up to the month and day of specified year), with whom (exact names, occupation, social status, family ties, origin of the person with whom the miracle occurred), accurate information about where lives healed or saved. A kind of “replication” of the same type of miracles does not cause scribes questions, because the obvious fact is help of a certain saint in healing specific ailments, and the more such evidence, the stronger the glory of the saint. Texts about miracles either come as close as possible to business writing (as in the life of Theoktist of Novgorod or some miracles of Evfimy Vyazhishchsky), or, on the contrary, preserve and even develop an artistic and fictional (sometimes with elements of psychologism) style of hagiographic rhetorical narration (as in the miracles of Anthony the Roman or Nikola Kochanov), or make a complex combination of list enumeration miracles that have happened and praise for the saint, which loses its independent meaning (as in the Kosin version of lives of the Novgorod saints). The analysis of the types and artistic originality of miracles in the lives of Novgorod saints allows us to draw conclusions about the complex literary situation in the field of hagiographic tradition in the late Middle Ages and early Modern times: most likely, the trends common to democratizing writing in each case had their own characteristics associated with many factors (tradition of veneration of the saint, textual history of vita, tastes of the compilers specific editions, etc.). It is also impossible to exclude a change in a person’s worldview, shifting it in a sense to a pragmatic understanding of holiness — as a mission of direct assistance to the living — which could no longer be ignored by the literature addressed to a person. © 2023, Daria B.

"Text classification with extremely weak supervision (EWS) imposes stricter supervision constraints compared to regular weakly supervised classification. Absolutely no labeled training samples or hand-crafted rules specific to the evaluation data are allowed. Such restrictions limit state-of-the-art EWS classification methods to indirect weak labeling techniques that assign unnatural label uncertainty estimates. We present PLAT, a framework that creates weak labels by leveraging recent developments in zero-shot text classification. PLAT employs models trained for sub-tasks other than classification to label documents. Most importantly, PLAT refrains from assigning overly confident weak labels and improves soft-label training performance for downstream classifiers. Classifiers trained with PLAT significantly outperform those trained on weak labels generated by the previous state-of-the-art in extremely weakly supervised text classification. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Hegemonic femininity is a concept beginning to receive scholarly attention, and this paper illustrates how it has become a critical factor hindering women's leadership opportunities in Indonesia. This study aims to understand how women leaders adopt, modify, or reject forms of hegemonic femininity that interpellate their constructions of subjectivity. This paper employs a discourse analysis of interview texts with 36 women in leadership positions in a Muslim-majority country, Indonesia. The finding shows how participants navigate hegemonic femininity by constructing their version of feminine subjectivity to negotiate their gender-leadership roles in several ways. This paper expands the critical discursive understanding of women's leadership by (1) theorizing how hegemonic femininity challenges the acceptance of women's leadership and (2) delineating the way construction of femininity affects the way women do leadership. © 2023 The Authors.

"Many children in primary grades show difficulties with reading fluency, hardly reading text or doing it effortfully and fruitlessly, making intervention programs for struggling readers a priority for researchers and schools. This paper analyzes the results of a reading intervention program for 182 second-grade struggling readers (boys = aged 7-8 46.7%) from public schools. Students received a multi-component program, including repeated readings, word recognition, morphological analysis, text interpretation, and writing skills. Participants received about fifty 45-minute intervention sessions over the school year. Using a difference-in-differences, quasi-experimental between- (intervention and control group) and within-group longitudinal design (three-point measurements), we found that the intervention group progressed significantly faster than a classmate control group (n = 827, boys = aged 7-8, 52.4%) in all reading outcomes (speed, accuracy, and expressiveness). By the end of the school year, differences between the intervention and control groups in accuracy and expressiveness become small but are still large in reading speed. Implications for research and practice are presented at the end of the paper. © 2023 Universidad de País Vasco"
"Masked language modeling (MLM) has been one of the most popular pretraining recipes in natural language processing, e.g., BERT, one of the representative models. Recently, contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has also attracted attention, especially its vision models that achieve excellent performance on a broad range of vision tasks. However, few studies are dedicated to studying the text encoders learned by CLIP. In this paper, we analyze the difference between BERT-style and CLIP-style text encoders from three experiments: (i) general text understanding, (ii) vision-centric text understanding, and (iii) text-to-image generation. Experimental analyses show that although CLIP-style text encoders underperform BERT-style ones for general text understanding tasks, they are equipped with a unique ability, i.e., synesthesia, for the cross-modal association, which is more similar to the senses of humans.

"Speculative fiction is a particularly relevant genre at the moment when, apart from the troubling global impact of late-modern phenomena, the ongoing pandemic and the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War have raised universal concern. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of two novels which describe a postapocalyptic world after a deadly plague and a nuclear conflict, respectively: Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake (2004 [2003]) and Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro 2033 (2010 [2005]). It approaches the texts as critiques of late-modern neoliberal capitalism, employing the theory by Zygmunt Bauman, Ulrich Beck and Mark Fisher. Additionally, it scrutinises the representation of the neoliberal subject in Atwood's book and utilises Svetlana Boym's reflection on nostalgia in post-Soviet Russia to comment on Glukhovsky's work. Lastly, it examines the posthuman alternative the two authors present for the deeply flawed human social orders. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. All rights reserved."
"In Deharvengt, et al,1 a technical error has occurred during the assembly of panel 4A in Figure 4. The correct Figure 4A is shown below in the corrected Figure 4. All results and conclusions of this article remain unchanged. Additionally, we have become aware that the control tumour growth data for the BxPC-3 line in Figure 2B may have been published in another paper by the collaborating lab where these data were obtained. While we were not able to verify this conclusively, out of abundance of caution, we have decided to remove the data obtained with the BxPC-3 cell line from this article. Figures 2 and 4 and their legends were modified to remove the data obtained with the BxPC-3 line. The corrected Figures 2 and 4 and their respective Figure Legends are shown below. The article text has been modified to remove references to the BxPC-3 cell line. As the results obtained with BxPC-3 cell line and AsPC-1 cell line are similar, this action does not change the conclusions of this paper. 2 FIGURE (Figure presented.)

(B) Morphometric analysis of vascular density in AsPC-1 tumours (shLuc-LVs (Luc), shPV1-1-LV (sh1) and shPV1-5-LV (sh5)). Error bars – SEM. The corrections to the article text are as follows: In the Abstract, the fourth sentence should read: ‘We find that PV1 downregulation by shRNAs inhibits the growth of established tumours derived human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cell line’. In the Methods section, under subheading ‘Pancreatic tumour xenograft model’ the first sentence should read: ‘Female athymic mice (Nu/Nu, Charles River) were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank area with 1 × 106 of ASPC-1 cells’. Under subheading ‘Colocalization of PV1 and CD31 in tumour samples by confocal microscopy’, the first sentence should read: ‘AsPC-1 tumours were induced as described and allowed to grow for 21 days’. In the Results Section, under subheading2 Intratumoral delivery of PV1 shRNA inhibits the growth of established pancreatic tumours’, the first sentence should read: ‘To determine whether the lentivirus mediated PV1 downregulation is able to inhibit PDAC growth we employed a model system consisting of heterotopic tumours derived from human PDAC cell line AsPC-1 grown subcutaneously in nude mice’. Second sentence should read: ‘Following subcutaneous injections of AsPC-1 cells, tumour growth was monitored and mice with established tumours (volume of 50 mm3) were enrolled in four different groups, one to be left untreated and three treated with one injection either of shPV1-1-LV, of shPV1-5-LV or shLuc-LV’. The fourth sentence should read: ‘A statistically significant difference in tumour volumes between shLuc-LV-injected tumours and shPV1-LV-injected tumours was seen as early as 24 and 33 days following viral injection of AsPC-1-derived tumours’. Seventh sentence is deleted. Last sentence should read: ‘Taken together, these data demonstrate that PV1 downregulation by two different shRNAs are able to inhibit pancreatic tumour growth in human PDAC xenograft models’. Under subheading3 PV1 is expressed specifically in the endothelial cells of tumour xenografts and is not expressed in tumour cells’, the second and third sentences should read: ‘To strengthen this observation, we defined the precise cellular type(s) expressing PV1 in the AsPC-1 derived tumours. Although PV1 is expressed in tumour ECs in many solid tumours including pancreatic cancer, there is no previous information regarding PV1 expression in AsPC-1 derived tumours’. The last two sentences should read: No expression of human PV1 was detected in the AsPC-1 or BxPC-3 tumour sections. Thus, in AsPC-1 tumours, PV1 is specifically expressed in the tumour ECs and not in the tumour cells per se, in good agreement with data in the literature obtained in other tumours. Under subheading4 PV1 downregulation does not affect vascular density of tumours’ the fourth sentence should read: ‘Quantitation data show that there are no statistically significant differences in vascular area density between the control and PV1 shRNAs treated AsPC-1 derived tumours (Figure 4B)’. In the Discussion Section, under paragraph three, the second sentence should read: ‘We used tumours derived from AsPC-1 cells, an established human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, isolated from metastatic PDAC tumours’. © 2023 The Authors.

"The literature on Ali Shariati, “the ideologue’’ of ‘‘the Iranian revolution,” and his arguments about women presents varied views, including rejection, criticism, and confirmation. While this literature is instructive, it primarily interprets Shariati’s texts from today’s socio-political perspective, and it thus lacks an analytical dimension that examines how and why Shariati’s ideas profoundly influenced numerous Iranian women in the 1970s. By revisiting the global and local socio-historical context of the 1970s and analyzing its influence on Iranian society, particularly the youth, as well as on Shariati’s perceptions and ideas about women’s social role within that socio-political context, this paper argues that Shariati crafted a “collective revolutionary Islamic identity” for women. This concept underscores the socio-historical and political significance of Shariati’s arguments about Muslim women in the political setting leading up to the revolution of 1979. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The pragmatics of Russian perfective and imperfective converbs is studied in the paper, based on works in linguistics and narratology within the modern Theory of Grounding. The research is focused on the pragmatic potential of Russian converbs that is realized in the stereoscopic space of a narrative, shaping its background (opposed to the foreground), designing its perspective. Firstly, the paper presents the analysis of trends in the research of Russian converbs and their text functions, both in Russia and abroad. The ideas of scholars who developed the Theory of Grounding in the USA and Europe are compared to the ones proposed by their colleagues in the USSR, especially to V. Vinogradov's findings. Secondly, it is shown that the traditional dichotomy of ""foreground""vs. ""background""has not been sufficient for describing the complicated structure of a narrative. The ""background zone""is proved to have its own hierarchy, and Russian converbs help to form its more or less prominent elements which draw the attention of the narrator and the narratee. Russian converbs have a number of features which determine the foregrounding or backgrounding effect of their use in a narrative. Some of these parameters can be revealed, so to say, ""before a text"". Among these are the semantics of the verb, its aspect, and its ability to have participants. For example, perfective converbs denoting dynamic, volitional, time-bounded, and telic actions referred to personal agent and affecting individualized object usually denote more foregrounded events in a narrative. Imperfective non-transitive converbs naming states tend to form the zone of deep background. Also, significant attention in the paper is paid to other parameters of Russian converbs, which can be registered only ""in a text"", analyzing the data in the Russian National Corpus. One of the most important characteristics is the relative frequency of a converb compared to the finite forms of the same verb. This parameter shows us if the verb is more or less apt to be used in the form of a converb in Russian texts, regardless of its own frequency in the corpus. Five semantic groups of Russian converbs with high relative frequency are revealed and described in the paper. Thirdly, the pragmatic potential of Russian converbs is illustrated using the material of the Russian- English parallel corpus and the collection of English translations of A. Èechov's stories. The trends in translating Russian converbs into English are analyzed, the effects of replacing converbs by finite forms are estimated, such as highlighting less important details, mistranslating causality and changing the perspective in the narrative. The presented results of the corpus and comparative study describe the pragmatic potential of Russian converbs in various semantic groups. Also, these results can help to make more profound the pre-translation analysis of Russian classic and contemporary literature. © 2023 Akademiai Kiado Rt.. All rights reserved."
"Sentiment analysis, i.e. the automatic evaluation of the emotional tone of a text, is a common task in natural language processing. Entity-Oriented Sentiment Analysis (EOSA) predicts the sentiment of entities mentioned in a given text. In this paper, we focus on the EOSA task for the Russian news. We propose a text classification pipeline to solve this task and show its potential in such tasks. Moreover, in general, EOSA implies labeling both named entities and their sentiment, which can require a lot of annotator labour and time and, thus, presents a major obstacle to the development of a production-ready EOSA system. To help alleviate this, we analyse the potential of applying an Active learning approach to EOSA tasks. We demonstrate that by actively selecting instances for labeling in EOSA the annotation effort required for training machine learning models can be significantly reduced. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"This paper constructs a model of cultural identitv by combining the analysis of multimodal discourse in the media fusion perspective and explores how to better construct cultural identity. Firstly, we construct a multimodal cultural identity model in ""the media convergence perspective from three modalities: text, image, and video combined with cultural identity. so that we can analvze people's cultural identity through emotion. Secondly. multimodal cross-sectional comparison experiments and dissimilarity experiments are conducted based on two widely used public datasets in the field. CMUMOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The best experimental results were obtained in the baseline model, where Acc-2 reached 84.8%. F1 value reached 84.5. and MAE of the regression task dropped to 0.548. In the robustness study, when the missing rate reached 44%. Acc-2 was only 652%. and the gap between the results and ""the dichotomous classification accuracy of 76:5% achieved by the model in this paper reached 11.3 percentage points. Finally, through affective analysis, cultural identity is the affirmative embodiment of what is most meaningful to the nation formed by people living together in a national community for a long time, and its core is the identification with the basic values of a nation, which is the spiritual bond that unites this national community. © 2023 Junfang Chang, published by Sciendo."
"Despite recent advancements, NLP models continue to be vulnerable to bias. This bias often originates from the uneven distribution of real-world data and can propagate through the annotation process. Escalated integration of these models in our lives calls for methods to mitigate bias without overbearing annotation costs. While active learning (AL) has shown promise in training models with a small amount of annotated data, AL's reliance on the model's behavior for selective sampling can lead to an accumulation of unwanted bias rather than bias mitigation. However, infusing clustering with AL can overcome the bias issue of both AL and traditional annotation methods while exploiting AL's annotation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive clustering-based active learning algorithm, D-CALM, that dynamically adjusts clustering and annotation efforts in response to an estimated classifier error-rate. Experiments on eight datasets for a diverse set of text classification tasks, including emotion, hatespeech, dialog act, and book type detection, demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline AL approaches with both pretrained transformers and traditional Support Vector Machines. DCALM showcases robustness against different measures of information gain and, as evident from our analysis of label and error distribution, can significantly reduce unwanted model bias. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The objective of this rapid review was to explore the current evidence base for mental health and disability research in Ghana. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist was followed. Online databases were used to identify primary studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, rapid reviews, or guidelines published between 2010 and 2020. All relevant published (both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature) on mental health and/or disability research conducted in or on Ghana between 2010 and 2020 were included in this review. 4,791 articles were identified in the initial search. After the removal of duplicates, followed by title and abstract screening, 930 articles were selected for full-text review. An additional 8 articles identified from reference lists of included articles were also included in full-text review. After review, 375 articles were selected for inclusion; 234 (62%) were on mental health while the remaining 141 (38%) were on disability. There is an increasing trend in the absolute number of mental health and/or disability studies. Most of the mental health studies included in this review were either observational quantitative studies (n=132; 56%) or observational qualitative studies (n=79; 34%). There were very few interventional studies (n=6; 3%). A similar finding was noted for the disability studies. External funding accounted for 51% of mental health articles. Although there was a steady year-on-year increase in the absolute number of mental health and/or disability studies conducted between 2010 to 2020, there is a need for more intervention studies to evaluate what mental health and/or disability interventions work, for whom, and under what circumstances. These should include evaluations of the cost, benefits, effectiveness, and acceptability of various interventions for policy and planning. Further, there is a need for the Ministry of Health to prioritize research funding for mental health and disability and enhance technical and methodological capacity of researchers to conduct disability and mental health research in Ghana.

"We introduce a synthetic dataset called Sentences Involving Complex Compositional Knowledge (SICCK) and a novel analysis that investigates the performance of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to understand compositionality in logic. We produce 1,304 sentence pairs by modifying 15 examples from the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases - modifiers that correspond to universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, negation, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corresponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models under the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existential quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Objective: To evaluate differences in quantitative features between poorly versus highly rated patient ratings of radiology reports. Methods: A HIPAA-compliant, IRB-waived study was performed from October 2019 to June 2021. Patients completed an optional 2-question survey (“How helpful was the report?” with a 5-star scale and an open text box) embedded into the patient portal, and reports were assessed for readability and brevity. Quantitative analyses were performed between poorly (≤3 stars) and highly rated (>3 stars) CT and MRI reports, including the use of structured reporting, number of words, words per sentence, Flesch Reading Ease, and Flesh-Kincaid Grade level within the findings and impression sections of the radiology reports. A two-tailed nonparametric Mann U Whitney test was performed for continuous variables and Chi2 for categorical variables. Results: Of the 490 responses, all 135 evaluating CT or MR were included (27%). 106/135 (78%) of the patients gave high ratings (score of 4 or 5). 46/135 (34%), the radiology reports were in a structured format. The proportion of highly rated reports were significantly higher for structured than freeform reports (93.5 vs. 70.8%, p = 0.002). In the findings section, highly rated reports had a lower Flesch Reading Ease score than poorly rated reports (19.6 vs. 28.9, p <0.01). No significant differences were observed between number of words (p=0.27), words per sentence (p=0.94), and Flesh-Kincaid Grade level (p=0.09) in the findings section. In the impression section, no differences were observed between highly vs. poorly rated reports among the measured parameters. Conclusion: Patients preferred highly rated reports that were structured and had lower Flesch Reading Ease scores in the findings section. © 2023"
"The detection and analysis of media bias and propaganda have become essential in the current information age. This paper presents our participation in the DIPROMATS task, which focusses on identifying and characterising propaganda techniques in text. We propose a hierarchical model that leverages both the provided DIPROMATS dataset and the SemEval'23 task 3 dataset for news genre categorisation and persuasion techniques detection. Our approach combines natural language processing techniques and transformer models to detect media bias and propaganda. We investigate the interplay between media bias and propaganda, recognising media bias as systematic favoritism or prejudice in information presentation, and propaganda as the deliberate use of persuasive techniques to manipulate public opinion. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and characterising propaganda techniques, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms used to influence public perception and fostering critical analysis of information consumption. Our model achieved competitive results among various teams across multiple languages, ranking within the top 6 for the propaganda identification task (F1=0.62), and within the top 8 for the fine-grained propaganda characterization (F1=0.27). This research contributes to ongoing efforts to combat media bias and propaganda, supporting the development of more informed and discerning societies. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Cross-lingual summarization aims to help people efficiently grasp the core idea of the document written in a foreign language. Modern text summarization models generate highly fluent but often factually inconsistent outputs, which has received heightened attention in recent research. However, the factual consistency of cross-lingual summarization has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual factuality dataset by collecting human annotations of reference summaries as well as generated summaries from models at both summary level and sentence level. Furthermore, we perform the fine-grained analysis and observe that over 50% of generated summaries and over 27% of reference summaries contain factual errors with characteristics different from monolingual summarization. Existing evaluation metrics for monolingual summarization require translation to evaluate the factuality of cross-lingual summarization and perform differently at different tasks and levels. Finally, we adapt the monolingual factuality metrics as an initial step towards the automatic evaluation of summarization factuality in cross-lingual settings.

"Intimacy is an essential element of human relationships and language is a crucial means of conveying it. Textual intimacy analysis can reveal social norms in different contexts and serve as a benchmark for testing computational models’ ability to understand social information. In this paper, we propose a novel weak-labeling strategy for data augmentation in text regression tasks called WADER. WADER uses data augmentation to address the problems of data imbalance and data scarcity and provides a method for data augmentation in cross-lingual, zero-shot tasks. We benchmark the performance of State-of-the-Art pre-trained multilingual language models using WADER and analyze the use of sampling techniques to mitigate bias in data and optimally select augmentation candidates. Our results show that WADER outperforms the baseline model and provides a direction for mitigating data imbalance and scarcity in text regression tasks. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In order to make full use of the decision support knowledge contained in the structured chart data that matches the needs of the enterprise, we propose a deep learning approach for automatic statistical chart analysis. This method uses LSTM as the basic model for chart analysis, and mainly makes the following improvements: (1) A discriminator layer is added after the embedding layer of the model, so that the model can perform more targeted semantic understanding and text prediction according to the knowledge of chart; (2) In the character sampling process of the model, a random cluster sampling strategy is proposed to improve the quality of chart description; (3) The model is optimized by using the knowledge distillation method, so that it can generate more valuable description text for manufacturing scenarios. Experiments show that this method improves the text quality by 12.4% compared with traditional LSTM. To further evaluate the analysis description quality of ASCAT, we use the same dataset to train RNN, LSTM, AISG, EICT, and AGNLD models. Experiment results show that our ASCAT model obtained better description quality evaluation scores in description quality under the METEOR criteria considering the precision and recall rate, or under the CIDEr criteria with the TF-IDF weight introduced. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"In this paper, we describe our submission for the AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 of SemEval-2023 . The task aims to perform monolingual sentiment classification (sub-task A) for 12 African languages, multilingual sentiment classification (sub-task B), and zero-shot sentiment classification (task C). For sub-task A, we conducted experiments using classical machine learning classifiers, Afro-centric language models, and language-specific models. For task B, we fine-tuned multilingual pretrained language models that support many of the languages in the task. For task C, we made use of a parameter-efficient Adapter approach that leverages monolingual texts in the target language for effective zero-shot transfer. Our findings suggest that using pre-trained Afrocentric language models improves performance for low-resource African languages. We also ran experiments using adapters for zero-shot tasks, and the results suggest that we can obtain promising results by using adapters with limited resources. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"In recent times, detecting depression using data collected from social network, like audio, video, image or text data, is a growing research field in emotion processing. Data from social media, which includes text data and gifs, emojis, etc., would be used for the analysis and classification processes. An autonomous depression detection system is required due to the complexity of conventional methods based on clinical diagnosis. Using data collected from social media, sentiment levels can be identified and monitored. In this paper, we aim to research on using machine learning/deep learning techniques combined to make a hybrid model. CNN is a technique proven to be efficient in feature extraction combined with Bidirectional LSTM, for contextual learning, both used to apply on the data collected from social media, train the data and obtain efficient results on the level of depressional traits in an individual. It has also been possible to get a reasonably high value of accuracy of 93% upon evaluation. The use of AI and machine learning in such systems has greatly assisted in many fields of medical science including psychology analysis.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In the age of big data, evidence keeps suggesting that small, elusive and infrequent details make all the difference in our appreciation of humanistic texts—film, fiction, and philosophy. This book argues, from a cross-disciplinary perspective, that expertise in humanistic translation is precisely the capacity to capture those details that are bigger than they seem. In humanistic translation, the expert handling of big details usually serves audiences and the original, but mala fide translation also works the details for subtle manipulation and audience deception. A focus on textual detail is therefore characteristic of humanistic translators but also compatible with central claims of the cultural turn in translation studies. This book, written by a scholar and teacher of literary, essayistic, and audiovisual translation, endeavors to articulate a seemingly dual interest—on textual detail and cultural analysis—as a single one. It theorizes connections between micro and macro analysis, between translation as detail and translation as culture, thus hoping to build bridges between humanistic translators and translation scholars. It acknowledges tensions between practice and theory and proposes a way forward: practitioners and scholars share ways of thinking—varieties of ""part-whole thinking""—that machines can never acquire. © 2024 Jeroen Vandaele.

"With the proliferation of social media platforms that provide anonymity, easy access, and the establishment of online communities and discussion, hate speech identification and monitoring has become a major concern for society, individuals and policymakers, which can be interpreted as hate speech. Many researchers attempted to detect hate speeches in multiple languages from social media, but the research was limited due to high complexity and minimum accuracy. A novel ‘HateDetector: Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Technique’ has been proposed to overcome these issues. In this technique, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is developed to identify the nature of the tweets by performing the process of code conversion and similarity check that results in good vector values representing the tweet nature. Additionally, the exact sentiment or nature of a tweet, whether hate or non-hate, is identified using the Profanity Check Technique (PCT), composed of ReLu activation function with a logistic regression classifier that classifies the resultant vectors and its respective emoji to neutral or hate speech.

"COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many nations, causing physical as well as mental health concerns globally. In most countries, governments enforced strict lockdowns and social distancing, thus affecting people's daily lives. People usually tweet their views on online platforms that is unstructured text with implicit meaning. With the evolution of artificial intelligence in the natural language processing domain, the prediction of sentiments accurately has become a challenge. To contribute as a solution to this, a hybrid approach is proposed for sentiment prediction with the use of an evolutionary-based approach, transfer-based learning and machine learning. The proposed approach uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) with genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM), namely, hybrid evolutionary intelligent model (GA-BERT-SVM). These approaches aid in extracting important features considering semantics and context present in the text. To avoid the limitations of the backpropagation approach, such as trapping in local minima and overfitting the data, the initial parameters (weights and biases) of the dense layers has been optimized using GA. Additionally, the pretrained BERT layers are utilized without any modification, following a standard transfer learning approach. The BERT embeddings are concatenated with the SVM for training and classification. GridSearchCV and GeneticSearchCV is used for obtaining optimal parameters of SVM. A multi-classification problem is tackled using a benchmark COVID-19 dataset, which comprises of Twitter data and is categorized into COVIDSENTI-A, COVIDSENTI-B, COVIDSENTI-C and a combined dataset called COVIDSENTI. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, F1-score, precision and recall, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Convolutional Neural network (CNN) has eclipsed end-to-end speaker identification (SI) systems in recent years. The enormous training data sets, high computational expenses, and memory usage all contribute to the lengthy time it takes to train a CNN. With fewer parameters but adequate accuracy, this study introduces an improved CNN for text-independent SI. Additional methods for reducing network training time and memory costs include offline feature extraction utilizing short segments of each audio sample and online data augmentation. On Voxceleb1, the proposed system appears to be more accurate than current speaker identification (SI) methods. Consequently, the suggested CNN enhances accuracy while lowering training time. Three feature extraction methods are employed in this work. Mel- frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), Power-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC), and Gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC) are the abbreviations for these procedures. Classifier performance and speed are boosted even more with the application of principal component analysis (PCA), a feature reduction approach. Both methodologies make use of artificial neural networks (ANN) that have been trained using a variety of methods. Classification accuracy is improved by the sequential weight/bias training approach and the PNCC feature extraction technique. Our proposed technique calls for lowering the number of neurons that contribute to optimal performance and processing time. Here selected seven speech sample neurons those are white, pink, Volvo, clean, babble, factor, and destroyer for experimental purposes. This speech sample extracted the features using MFCC, GFCC, and PNCC techniques for experimental works. It is the maximum identification rate using MFCC feature extraction in comparison to the GFCC and PNCC feature extraction techniques. By using the proposed technique find out the maximum 96.90% SI using the MFCC feature extraction technique. The number of concealed units appears to be connected to the conversation's total number of participants. Here trained the RNN with 42–60 hidden units for 20 voices. More covert units increased the acceptance ratio by more than 90%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"In February 2020, thousands of refugees were met with massive border police violence at the Turkish-Greek border after Erdoğan opened the borders to the European Union. As images displaying this violence started circulating, Twitter users in Germany mobilized a network of solidarity using the hashtag #WirhabenPlatz (“we have space”). The hashtag was almost immediately hijacked by far-right actors to contest the claims of solidarity and mobilize nativist sentiments. Combining methods of network and text analysis, this chapter aims to understand how far-right publics hijacked this hashtag-public by engaging in affective media practices. Network analysis reveals that far-right users managed to mobilize the largest and loudest community in the network. Hashtag co-occurrence analysis shows how they subverted the hashtag’s original meaning to spread nativist sentiments and transformed this public into a site of contested sentiments. Qualitative text analysis exemplifies how the practice of hijacking invites irony, sarcasm, and mockery—also fostered by Twitter’s affordances—rather than expression of explicit emotions. Finally, the study outlines how far-right actors engage in these practices to construct a nativist “We” under threat and perform counterpublicness as a tension with the general public, which situates them in a state of marginalization and victimhood. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Margreth Lünenborg and Birgitt Röttger- Rössler."
"This paper describes the submission of UZH_CLyp for the SemEval 2023 Task 9 “Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis”. We achieved second-best results in all 10 languages according to the official Pearson’s correlation regression evaluation measure. Our cross-lingual transfer learning approach explores the benefits of using a Head-First Fine-Tuning method (HeFiT) that first updates only the regression head parameters and then also updates the pre-trained transformer encoder parameters at a reduced learning rate. Additionally, we study the impact of using a small set of automatically generated examples (in our case, from ChatGPT) for low-resource settings where no human-labeled data is available. Our study shows that HeFiT stabilizes training and consistently improves results for pre-trained models that lack domain adaptation to tweets. Our study also shows a noticeable performance increase in cross-lingual learning when synthetic data is used, confirming the usefulness of current text generation systems to improve zero-shot baseline results. Finally, we examine how possible inconsistencies in the annotated data contribute to cross-lingual interference issues. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"In recent years, sentiment analysis has gained significant importance in natural language processing. However, most existing models and datasets for sentiment analysis are developed for high-resource languages, such as English and Chinese, leaving low-resource languages, particularly African languages, largely unexplored. The AfriSenti-SemEval 2023 Shared Task 12 aims to fill this gap by evaluating sentiment analysis models on low-resource African languages. In this paper, we present our solution to the shared task, where we employed different multilingual XLM-R models with classification head trained on various data, including those retrained in African dialects and fine-tuned on target languages. Our team achieved the third-best results in Subtask B, Track 16: Multilingual, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. While our model showed relatively good results on multilingual data, it performed poorly in some languages. Our findings highlight the importance of developing more comprehensive datasets and models for low-resource African languages to advance sentiment analysis research. We also provided the solution on the github repository. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In this paper, we propose a new model for annotating dependency relations at the Mandarin character level with the aim of building treebanks to cope with the unsatisfactory performance of existing word segmentation and syntactic analysis models in specific scientific domains, such as Chinese patent texts. The result is a treebank of 100 sentences annotated according to our scheme, which also serves as a training corpus that facilitates the subsequent development of a joint word segmenter and dependency analyzer that enables downstream tasks in Chinese to be separated from the non-standardized pre-processing step of word segmentation. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This paper investigates how brands delineate their visual identity in avatar (profile photo) and header (cover photo) on social media platforms. The content analysis of the top 50 Indian brands was conducted from 116 screenshots taken from the brand’s Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube page to determine the visual identity exhibited by brands on social media platforms. We found the actual use of visual elements, i.e., logotype, text type, typography, colour, and photographic elements employed by brands in avatar and header to demonstrate their visual identity. The findings also revealed that brands are inconsistent in wielding their overall visual identity across three social media platforms. Designers and marketers are suggested to position their brand across social media platforms strategically. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved."

"Intimacy estimation of a given text has recently gained importance due to the increase in direct interaction of NLP systems with humans. Intimacy is an important aspect of natural language and has a substantial impact on our everyday communication. Thus the level of intimacy can provide us with deeper insights and richer semantics of conversations. In this paper, we present our work on the SemEval shared task 9 on predicting the level of intimacy for the given text. The dataset consists of tweets in ten languages, out of which only six are available in the training dataset. We conduct several experiments and show that an ensemble of multilingual models along with a language-specific monolingual model has the best performance. We also evaluate other data augmentation methods such as translation and present the results. Lastly, we study the results thoroughly and present some noteworthy insights into this problem. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Radiology reports are vital elements of directing patient care. They are usually delivered in free text form, which makes them prone to errors, such as omission in reporting radiological findings and using difficult-to-comprehend mental shortcuts. Although structured reporting is the recommended method, its adoption continues to be limited. Radiologists find structured reports too limiting and burdensome. In this paper, we propose the model, which is meant to preserve the benefits of free text, while moving towards a structured report. The model automatically parametrizes Polish radiology reports based on language models. The models are trained on a large dataset of 1200 chest computed tomography (CT) reports annotated by multiple medical experts reports with 44 observation tags. Experimental analysis shows that models based on language models are able to achieve satisfactory results despite being pretrained on general domain corpora. Overall, the model achieves an F1 score of 81% and is able to successfully parametrize the most common radiological observations, allowing for potential adaptation in clinical practice. Our model is publicly available. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Recent years have witnessed significant transformations in cardiovascular medicine, driven by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). This scoping review was conducted to capture the breadth of AI applications within cardiovascular science. Employing a structured approach, we sourced relevant articles from PubMed, with an emphasis on journals encompassing general cardiology and digital medicine. We applied filters to highlight cardiovascular articles published in journals focusing on general internal medicine, cardiology and digital medicine, thereby identifying the prevailing trends in the field. Following a comprehensive full-text screening, a total of 140 studies were identified. Over the preceding 5 years, cardiovascular medicine’s interplay with AI has seen an over tenfold augmentation. This expansive growth encompasses multiple cardiovascular subspecialties, including but not limited to, general cardiology, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia. Deep learning emerged as the predominant methodology. The majority of AI endeavors in this domain have been channeled toward enhancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, utilizing resources such as hospital datasets, electrocardiograms, and echocardiography. A significant uptrend was observed in AI’s application for omics data analysis. However, a clear gap persists in AI’s full-scale integration into the clinical decision-making framework. AI, particularly deep learning, has demonstrated robust applications across cardiovascular subspecialties, indicating its transformative potential in this field. As we continue on this trajectory, ensuring the alignment of technological progress with medical ethics becomes crucial. The abundant digital health data today further accentuates the need for meticulous systematic reviews, tailoring them to each cardiovascular subspecialty.

"Text style transfer is an exciting task within the field of natural language generation that is often plagued by the need for high-quality paired datasets. Furthermore, training a model for multi-attribute text style transfer requires datasets with sufficient support across all combinations of the considered stylistic attributes, adding to the challenges of training a style transfer model. This paper explores the impact of training data input diversity on the quality of the generated text from the multi-style transfer model. We construct a pseudo-parallel dataset by devising heuristics to adjust the style distribution in the training samples. We balance our training dataset using marginal and joint distributions to train our style transfer models. We observe that a balanced dataset produces more effective control effects over multiple styles than an imbalanced or skewed one. Through quantitative analysis, we explore the impact of multiple style distributions in training data on style-transferred output. These findings will better inform the design of style-transfer datasets. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Web defacement refers to the unauthorized alteration of the appearance or content of a website, which can have detrimental effects on its operations and financial standing. Deep learning techniques have shown promise in detecting web defacement incidents. This research explores the application of three deep learning models, namely Bi-LSTM, GRU, and BERT, for web defacement detection. The study collects data from various sources, including defaced and regular websites, followed by preprocessing steps such as case folding. The selected models are then employed to build the detection models. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score are used to compare the performance of the models. The findings reveal that the Bi-LSTM model outperforms the GRU and BERT models in terms of accuracy (0.990), precision (0.984), and F1 score (0.953) for classifying web defacement based on textual content. This superiority can be attributed to the Bi-LSTM model's ability to process sequential information and capture contextual dependencies using the recurrent neural network architecture. It leverages bidirectional information flow, enabling better understanding and representation of the text. However, it is essential to consider other factors impacting model performance, such as dataset characteristics, data preprocessing techniques, and model configurations. The results of this research provide valuable insights into utilizing deep learning models, particularly Bi-LSTM, for effective web defacement detection.  © 2023 IEEE."
"A traditional cultural text detection model is constructed using a full convolutional net model and a feature fusion method in this paper. Bilinear interpolation calculates the aspect ratio between the original and target features maps. Combined with transpose convolution, the feature map is reduced to pixel space to extract traditional cultural features. A residual network is used to achieve constant mapping, which improves the network's overall performance and increases its depth. The mapping coordinates of the input image are obtained by calculating anchor box positive samples using text box truth values. Combined with the depth search algorithm, all segments of the same text are detected, articulated, and combined. The results show that combining traditional culture and Civic Education is beneficial to improve students' overall ability, with 65% improvement in grades and 55% improvement in ideology. © 2023 Yan Zhang, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Introduction. The relevance of the study is due to the need for an objective study of events related to the history of the civil war. The study of archival sources by the Tsaritsyn (since 1925 – Stalingrad) Commission for the collection and processing of materials on the history of the October Revolution and the Civil War (histparty) will expand the documentary base for researchers on this topic. The purpose of the article is to conduct a source and archeographic study of the memoirs of one of the prominent figures of the Civil War. The author’s tasks were to identify the memories of A.K. Vydrin in the Stalingrad Histparty Fund, study the biography of their author, and analyze the preserved memories as a historical source on the history of Tsaritsyn 1918–1920. Methods and materials. The article is based on archival documents and materials from the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History and the State Archive of the Volgograd region. The study of archival documents was based on the principles of source studies and critical analysis of historical sources. In the 1920s and 1930s, the memoirs of eyewitnesses to the events were published, including those of participants in the fighting on the Tsaritsyn front (V. Alekseev, S. Minin, etc.). However, most of the memories have not yet been introduced into scientific circulation. Analysis. When analyzing the memories, the author’s personality is characterized, and a textual and factual study of the text is carried out. Results. The result of the study is a biography of a participant in the civil war and the historical value of memories as a source on the history of Tsaritsyn at the beginning of the twentieth century. Authors’contribution. O.V. Rvacheva analyzed the activities of the Histparty Commission, described the tasks of forming narrative sources, characterized the memoirs as a specific source base, and revealed information that reveals the historical value of A.K.

"COVID-19 significantly influenced travel behaviours and public attitudes towards public transport. Various studies have illustrated complicated factors related to long-term travel behaviour, indicating difficulty in understanding and predicting post-pandemic long-term travel behaviour via traditional methods. In these complex circumstances, it is valuable to take advantage of social media data to obtain real-time public opinions to understand dynamic travel behaviour changes from the passenger perspective. The present study provides a means - leveraging Twitter data and state-of-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies - to interpret the underlying associations among public attitude, COVID-19 trends and public travel behaviour. Concretely, New York City has been selected due to its dependence on public transit for daily commuting. More than 500K tweets have been collected from January 2019 to June 2022. Automated text mining, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis have been implemented in these contexts to identify dynamic public reactions. A consistently negative attitude to public transit is detected and five main topics, including derivative topics from COVID-19, are discovered within the COVID-19 duration. Policy makers and transit managers can use these topics to take onboard the public's concerns. The paper thus exemplifies how social media data and NLP technologies can support policy-making progress and can benefit other tasks in the transportation domain. © 2023 IEEE."
"Students generally face tremendous pressure – from their competing peers, expectant guardians, and the society as a whole. These tend to make them vulnerable, and may lead to development of mental quirks that are very hard to remove with time. This chapter reports a venture to detect negative streaks existing within the human mind – especially, amongst the student community. Some machine-learning tools are utilized to study their sentiments from their day-to-day communications and practices. The end-product is a minuscule model to detect participants who are experiencing alarmingly stressed conditions. The system reports encouraging results within the limited periphery in which it has been tested so far. The main objective is to open up the vista of research on the virgin ground of detecting emotion from word usage and writing hand. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This chapter is concerned with disclosing the myriad ways in which themes of the apocalyptic imagination inspire, inform, and explicate a modern electro-acoustic music composition. The conceptual framework of this text launches from a rubric of apocalyptic themes consisting of apocalyptic time, apocalyptic literary structure, and the theological doctrine of apokatastasis, or restoration. The ultimate focus of this chapter is an analysis of the original composition APOKATASTASIS, for chamber orchestra and computer-generated sound, completed and premiered in 2021. I summarize how the composition engages the rubric of apocalyptic ideas set forth in the introduction to facilitate a singular listening experience informed by a hotly debated doctrine of early Christianity. I conclude with a proposal of the music listening experience as offering the possibility of psychic transformation and ""personal apocalypse"". © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2023."
"Social media usage was made easier by the internet's expanding accessibility, which also encouraged people to share their thoughts openly. However, it also gives content polluters a platform to spread objectionable postings or contents. Most of these inflammatory postings are written in many languages and are therefore simple to dodge internet monitoring programmes. This study serves as an example of our work towards the EACL 2021 joint task on the identification of offensive language in Dravidian languages. The identification of offensive language in the major social media sites was previously discovered. The necessity to identify offensive language in multilingual messages that are substantially code-mixed or written in a non-native script has arisen as a result of the increase in user diversity. The dataset consists of local languages such as Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil with English code-matching. To acquire the requirements used machine learning method (LR, SVM), deep learning technique-LSTM, and transformer-m-BERT.

"In recent years, China has been gradually improving its tourism services along with its economic development. Inbound tourism not only boosts the economy of China, but also creates issues and challenges for tourism administration. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel text mining approach that combines topic modeling and sentiment analysis for exploring the dynamic evolution of topic intensity of destination attractions and discovering the reasons for foreign tourists’ dissatisfactions. To this end, we propose an LDA-based topic evolution model, develop a tourism-oriented VADER dictionary and introduce an integration method for screening negative reviews. Then, the approach was used to analyze 80,546 online travel reviews from foreign tourists on TripAdvisor for 10 popular destination attractions in China from 2011 to 2019. The findings can help tourism practitioners better understand the changes and trends of the topics over time as well as develop strategies with respect to tourists’ dissatisfactions. © 2023 Asia Pacific Tourism Association."
"This study investigates the use of the finite verb-focus forms -jә and -mә in Kolyma Yukaghir. These forms are described in terms of valency: -jә is the intransitive form, and -mә is the transitive. In this study, I revise this analysis by using decision tree modeling on five monologic texts annotated for different discourse and morphological factors. The results show that 1) valency alone cannot account for the distribution of the finite verb-focus forms in discourse, and 2) speakers are sensitive to different discourse factors and use -jә and -mә to achieve different communicative goals. In short, this study demonstrates how machine learning methods like classification decision trees can offer a more nuanced picture of the choices speakers make at the discourse level and help the language description process. © COMPUTEL 2023 - 6th Workshop on the Use of Computational Methods in the Study of Endangered Languages, Proceedings of the Workshop."
"The human values expressed in argumentative texts can provide valuable insights into the culture of a society. They can be helpful in various applications such as value-based profiling and ethical analysis. However, one of the first steps in achieving this goal is to detect the category of human value from an argument accurately. This task is challenging due to the lack of data and the need for philosophical inference. It also can be challenging for humans to classify arguments according to their underlying human values.

"Recently, high-performing code generation systems based on large language models have surfaced. They are trained on massive corpora containing much more natural text than actual executable computer code. This work shows that current code generation systems exhibit undesired biases inherited from their large language model backbones, which can reduce the quality of the generated code under specific circumstances. To investigate the effect, we propose the”block of influence” concept, which enables a modular decomposition and analysis of the coding challenges. We introduce an automated intervention mechanism reminiscent of adversarial testing that exposes undesired biases through the failure modes of the models under test. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used as a data transformation technique during fine-tuning, acting as a mitigation strategy for these biases. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Historically, a specific set of symptoms has been related to the rupture and repair of anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms. These consequences were defined as the ‘ACoA syndrome’ and included observations of severe memory loss, confabulation and personality or behavioural changes. These observations correspond to neuropsychological impairments in memory, executive functions and social cognition. However, in more recent studies, the existence of such a distinct syndrome has been called into question. We aimed to investigate the existence of the ACoA syndrome, by combining analysis of our own data with a systematic review of the literature. Memory, executive functions and social cognition of subarachnoid haemorrhage patients with ACoA aneurysms (N = 28) were compared to patients with aneurysms in other locations (N = 66). Results showed no significant differences. Subsequently, a systematic review of the existing literature on the ACoA syndrome was performed using Embase and PubMed until October 2022. Studies that investigated cognitive functions after rupture and repair of ACoA aneurysms were included. The search yielded 847 unique entries and after screening titles and abstracts, 648 records were excluded. 199 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 55 articles were included. Evidence was found for the ACoA syndrome in studies between 1960 and 2000, with impairments in memory and executive problems in the majority of studies. However, the majority of studies from 2000 did not demonstrate a distinct ACoA syndrome, although neuropsychological measurements improved. This coincides with the changes in the management of ACoA aneurysms over the past decades, such as the emergence of endovascular treatment and improvement of neurointensive care. Therefore, we hypothesize that the management techniques of ACoA aneurysms until around 2000, i.e. mainly conventional clipping, could be related to the presence of symptoms of the ACoA syndrome. © 2023 The Authors.

"Linguistic analysis is a core task in the process of documenting, analyzing, and describing endangered and less-studied languages. In addition to providing insight into the properties of the language being studied, having tools to automatically label words in a language for grammatical category and morphological features can support a range of applications useful for language pedagogy and revitalization. At the same time, most modern NLP methods for these tasks require both large amounts of data in the language and compute costs well beyond the capacity of most research groups and language communities. In this paper, we present a gloss-to-gloss (g2g) model for linguistic analysis (specifically, morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging) that is lightweight in terms of both data requirements and computational expense. The model is designed for the interlinear glossed text (IGT) format, in which we expect the source text of a sentence in a low-resource language, a translation of that sentence into a language of wider communication, and a detailed glossing of the morphological properties of each word in the sentence. We first produce silver standard parallel glossed data by automatically labeling the high-resource translation. The model then learns to transform source language morphological labels into output labels for the target language, mediated by a structured linguistic representation layer. We test the model on both low-resource and high-resource languages, and find that our simple CNN-based model achieves comparable performance to a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, at a fraction of the computational cost.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Why does every book about the opioid epidemic have a landscape photograph on the cover? Landscape photography has had a persistent role in media coverage of America’s opioid epidemic since at least 2016. This paper explores the phenomenon through analyses of a selection of recent, popular press book covers whose texts address the crisis, asking what this marketing strategy reveals. What do these images tell us about how we approach the opioid crisis, and how that approach may differ from previous addiction epidemics in America? How does the perceived whiteness of this epidemic influence how we visualize it? My argument is that, for the educated, urban reader whom these books are marketed to, the images are intended to evoke our existing anxieties about those other crises–climate change and American economic decline–provoking empathy with the victims of the opioid crisis. This signal to empathy may point to not only a changing approach to addiction but a shift in American culture’s attitude towards the future. © 2023 College Art Association."
"This paper addresses the challenge of enriching a Spanish sentiment analysis corpus with minority instances. Existing sentiment analysis resources for Spanish suffer from a significant class imbalance, limiting the representation of minority sentiments. We propose a methodology that leverages social media data and user-generated content to collect diverse Spanish text samples expressing a wide range of sentiments. We employ rigorous annotation and data augmentation techniques to ensure the quality and balance of the enriched corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that enriching the corpus with minority instances significantly improves sentiment analysis model performance, enhancing inclusivity and accuracy in Spanish sentiment analysis. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The paper describes experiments within shared task AuTexTification: Automated Text Identification 2023. The approach is based on a pre-trained model. We selected the DeBERTaV2 model. Our run reached an Macro-F1 score of 67.2 and was ranked on position 15 out of 76 submissions for subtask 1. The paper also presents an analysis of both text classes based on text metrics. The observation of various readability metrics shows that the generated texts tend to show less diversity than human texts. © 2023 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
"Unstructured data is considered complex due to the varieties of formats, quality and file sizes, correspondingly, it incurs a high latent and hidden storage cost. It is commonly underutilized for industry best practices’ patterns analysis. Traditionally, engineers and geoscientists extract historical well information manually which consume time and resources, limiting the investigation to a small subset of wells. In addition, the success rate to extend benchmarking analysis to hundreds of wells information within a short period of time is low, since the manual process is prone to human error and human bias. To maximize the utilization of unstructured data, a machine learning (ML) based solution is proposed to develop new sand control best practices to enhance oil and gas production in new and mature fields. The ‘multi-modal’ solution utilizes ML technology stack such as Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network (DCNN) for image processing and image classification, Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) and Optical-Character-Recognition (OCR) for text and entity processing and recognition applied in an enterprise-scale setting. The automated end-to-end data pipeline processing flow is designed to transform unstructured data into structured data that is readily available for domain expert users’ evaluation, research and timely decision-making. In this paper, the solution is applied to generate in-depth sand production and sanding pattern analysis throughout Norwegian basins and develop large-scale industry ‘best practices’. Data are ingested for three hundred sixty-one (361) wells, and a total of sixteen (16) days was utilized to analyse the wells presented in this study. Intelligent analytical tools including heat map, knowledge graph, deep search, lithology frequency count, and well information summary contributes significantly to provide a comprehensive understanding of sand production trends, causation and develop sand control management best practice. Maximizing unstructured data accessibility has proven to be effective in reducing sand management research time and effort, while providing a holistic analysis that can be applicable to nearby offset wells planned to be drilled in future.

"This text is about vacant lots as unrecognized and undervalued spaces in our society. They are transitional landscapes, without defined form or intention, but with a potential to constantly transform and adapt. It reflects on how we perceive and relate to these landscapes, how our perception/relationship is conditioned by filters and preexisting expectations. The importance of paying attention to understand and relate to these spaces is emphasized. Attention is described as a way of being present, listening, and understanding others' experiences. It is suggested that art can be a generator of spaces for connection and care in these landscapes. Lastly, it raises the idea that these vacant lots are places where forms of resistance and queer expression can be found. Spaces where plants and beings find their own way of existing and enter into relation and coexistence. The importance of valuing these spaces for their capacity to reflect the pleasure of existence, beyond their physical form. © 2023 AusArt."
"This paper focuses on analyzing and studying digital capitalism using a textual analysis model in the context of Marxist political economy. The magnitude of the angle between text vectors can be used to measure the similarity between digital capitalism and political economy. An iterative computational approach is employed to address the issue of overfitting in text. Constructing a BERT model involves formulating a self-attentive mechanism and setting up an embedding layer. The direction of digital capitalism's ideology in the political economy context is examined about its characteristics. The results show that digital labor is more secretive regarding office location than traditional labor, with a secrecy rate of 60%. Unpaidness, large quantity, and potential value dominate data characteristics, with 90% unpaid data.  © 2023 Meng Li et al., published by Sciendo 2023."
"Computational Intelligence Applications for Text and Sentiment Data Analysis explores the most recent advances in text information processing and data analysis technologies, specifically focusing on sentiment analysis from multifaceted data. The book investigates a wide range of challenges involved in the accurate analysis of online sentiments, including how to i) identify subjective information from text, i.e., exclusion of ‘neutral’ or ‘factual’ comments that do not carry sentiment information, ii) identify sentiment polarity, and iii) domain dependency. Spam and fake news detection, short abbreviation, sarcasm, word negation, and a lot of word ambiguity are also explored. Further chapters look at the difficult process of extracting sentiment from different multimodal information (audio, video and text), semantic concepts. In each chapter, the book's authors explore how computational intelligence (CI) techniques, such as deep learning, convolutional neural network, fuzzy and rough set, global optimizers, and hybrid machine learning techniques play an important role in solving the inherent problems of sentiment analysis applications. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of semantic mapping as a science text reading strategy on high school students' inferential understanding. For this purpose, eight science text reading classes were conducted a reading strategy using semantic mapping for 46 students in two science-focused classes in the third grade of a high school. To investigate the effects of semantic mapping reading strategy on students’ inferential comprehension, students’ pre- and post-reading ability tests results were analyzed. In order to find out the change in inferential comprehension, the level of the inferential comprehension was analyzed using the analysis framework for developed in this study. For the classification of inferential comprehension, the levels of the inferential comprehension were converted into scores. The results of the analysis of changes in students' inferential comprehension showed that semantic mapping reading strategy classes influenced the changes in high school students' inference, especially bridge inference and elaborative inference among sub-elements of inferential comprehension. © 2023 Korean Chemical Society.

"Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common, often co-occur, and are associated with poor health outcomes across the life course. Emerging research has emphasized the lasting consequences of ACEs across generations, suggesting parental ACEs are associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes in children. However, the individual effects of fathers’ ACEs and pathways of transmission remain unclear. A scoping review was conducted to summarize the current knowledgebase of the intergenerational consequences of parental ACEs on offspring health, clarify pathways of transmission, understand how ACEs are operationalized in the intergenerational literature, and identify gaps in knowledge. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched for articles published in English from 1995 to 2022 relating to the long-term consequences of parental ACEs on offspring physical and mental health. Articles underwent title, abstract, and full-text review by two investigators. Content analysis was performed to integrate findings across the included studies. Results: The search yielded 14,542 unique articles; 49 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six articles focused exclusively on mothers, one solely on fathers, and 12 included both mothers and fathers in their analyses. Six studies used an expanded definition of ACEs. Both direct and indirect associations between parental ACEs and poor offspring outcomes were identified, primarily through biological and psychosocial pathways. Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance and oversight of fathers and the need to solidify a unified definition and measure of ACEs. This review identified modifiable protective factors (social support, father involvement) and pathways of transmission (parental mental health, parenting); both having important implications for intervention development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Interoperability is the key to industrial automation. OPC UA aims to provide interoperability between industrial machines at the network, protocol, and semantic layers. In order to achieve it, the implementation of a machine and its nodeset file should comply with the OPC UA standard. However, there are a few areas for improvement in technology to automatically check compliance since the compliance rules/validation rules are expressed in textual format in specification documents. In other words, they are not machine-interpretable. Converting the text-based specification into machine-readable form is a complex problem since each companion specification is domain-specific and written by a set of industry experts from all over the world from diverse language backgrounds. The specifications are majorly unique, with little commonality between them. Because of these reasons, it is challenging to develop a generic information extraction approach to retrieve rules that work for all specifications. In this study, we aim to handle this challenge to extract the textual rules from specifications automatically by applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies. We present our methodology based on Named Entity Recognition for OPC UA documents for information extraction and text classification to identify rules. To achieve this goal, we created five named entity data sets from five selected OPC UA companion specifications. The sentences in the data set and the entities in the sentences were annotated by two OPC UA experts. We point out a deeper analysis of the data sets to highlight common and unique entities in them and show their usage in identifying the rules in the specifications. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article compiles research on the extraction of human characteristics using three different methods: questionnaires, annota- tions, and biases. We have performed an analysis of how personalized perception of texts is affected by individual human profile and bias. To acquire comprehensive knowledge about individual user prefer- ences, we have gathered 40 users who annotated 1000 texts in 26 subjective tasks grouped into three categories: positive affect, neg- ative affect, and rational affect. The results revealed that categories of annotation were correlated with psychological dimensions, e.g., agreeableness and conscientiousness, which are traits related to pos- itive affect dimension biases. We have observed the presence of two clearly defined categories among annotators when it comes to the aspect of humor: those who confidently share their perspectives on what they find funny and those who tend to rate humor levels within a narrow range. Moreover, we analyzed intra-annotator agreement to show that people tend to change their ratings over time. Our results show that the higher level of the ranking correlation between anno- tations and agreement calculated using binarized annotations com- pared to the absolute agreement calculated using full annotations im- plies that the 10-point annotation scale might be a significant factor in annotator disagreement. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"ASD may be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including gene mutations and exposure to toxins. People with ASD may also have trouble forming social relationships, have difficulty with communication and language, and struggle with sensory sensitivity. These difficulties can range from mild to severe and can affect a person’s ability to interact with the world around them. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects people in different ways. But early detection of ASD in a child is a good option for parents to start corrective therapies and treatment. They can take action to reduce the ASD symptoms in their child. The proposed work is the detection of ASD in a child using a parent’s dialog. The most popular Bert model and recent ChatGPT have been utilized to analyze the sentiment of each statement from parents for the detection of symptoms of ASD. The Bert model has been developed by the transformers which are the most popular in the natural language processing field whereas the ChatGPT model is a large language model (LLM). It is based on Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that can able to generate the sentiment of the sentence, computer language codes, text paragraphs, etc. The sentiment analysis has been done on parents’ dialog using the Bert model and ChatGPT model. The data has been prepared from various Autism groups on social sites and other resources on the internet. The data has been cleaned and prepared to train the Bert model and ChatGPT model. The Bert model is able to detect the sentiment of each sentence from parents. Any positive sentiment detection means parents should be aware of their children. The proposed model has given 83 percent accuracy according to the prepared data. © (2023) All Rights Reserved."
"Data-driven analyses of biases in historical texts can help illuminate the origin and development of biases prevailing in modern society. However, digitised historical documents pose a challenge for NLP practitioners as these corpora suffer from errors introduced by optical character recognition (OCR) and are written in an archaic language. In this paper, we investigate the continuities and transformations of bias in historical newspapers published in the Caribbean during the colonial era (18th to 19th centuries). Our analyses are performed along the axes of gender, race, and their intersection. We examine these biases by conducting a temporal study in which we measure the development of lexical associations using distributional semantics models and word embeddings. Further, we evaluate the effectiveness of techniques designed to process OCR-generated data and assess their stability when trained on and applied to the noisy historical newspapers. We find that there is a trade-off between the stability of the word embeddings and their compatibility with the historical dataset. We provide evidence that gender and racial biases are interdependent, and their intersection triggers distinct effects. These findings align with the theory of intersectionality, which stresses that biases affecting people with multiple marginalised identities compound to more than the sum of their constituents. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In today's rapidly changing society, exploring the historical evolution of Marxist ideology in Civic Education can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. In this paper, oriented to Civic Education, we use crawlers and other related technologies to obtain a Civic Text Corpus and complete the acquisition of Civic entities based on the BiLSTMCRF model for its annotation and collection. The acquired entities are divided into unstructured and semi-structured data, and the former is used to extract the relational triad by crawling technology, while the latter is obtained with the help of dependency syntactic analysis. Based on the analysis of the constructed cognitive map of Civic Education, the word ""construction""in Marxist Civic Education in the 21st century has the highest degree of enthusiasm, reaching 0.191, followed by ""student"", with a degree of enthusiasm of 0.150.  © 2023 Lu Liu, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Social determinants of health (SDOH) documented in the electronic health record through unstructured text are increasingly being studied to understand how SDOH impacts patient health outcomes. In this work, we utilize the Social History Annotation Corpus (SHAC), a multi-institutional corpus of de-identified social history sections annotated for SDOH, including substance use, employment, and living status information. We explore the automatic extraction of SDOH information with SHAC in both standoff and inline annotation formats using GPT-4 in a one-shot prompting setting. We compare GPT-4 extraction performance with a high-performing supervised approach and perform thorough error analyses. Our prompt-based GPT-4 method achieved an overall 0.652 F1 on the SHAC test set, similar to the 7th best-performing system among all teams in the n2c2 challenge with SHAC.  © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Text detoxification is a conditional text generation task aiming to remove offensive content from toxic text. It is highly useful for online forums and social media, where offensive content is frequently encountered. Intuitively, there are diverse ways to detoxify sentences while preserving their meanings, and we can select from detoxified sentences before displaying text to users. Conditional diffusion models are particularly suitable for this task given their demonstrated higher generative diversity than existing conditional text generation models based on language models. Nonetheless, text fluency declines when they are trained with insufficient data, which is the case for this task. In this work, we propose DiffuDetox, a mixed conditional and unconditional diffusion model for text detoxification. The conditional model takes toxic text as the condition and reduces its toxicity, yielding a diverse set of detoxified sentences. The unconditional model is trained to recover the input text, which allows the introduction of additional fluent text for training and thus ensures text fluency. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DiffuDetox. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The paper analyzes the group of new words with the first component Z- in its quantitative and qualitative diversity. The novelty of the work is determined by the choice of lexical material: composite words with the first component Z- appeared in the Russian language quite recently, in 2022 and 2023. The studied material reflects one of the most important sociolinguistic trends in the Russian language of the newest period: the consolidation of the letter Z as a symbol and an iconic representative of the concept. The paper reveals the mechanism of the discursive transition of the unofficial military-technical term Z to the mass media and the further formation of a symbolic meaning for the letter: initially, the sign appears on photographs and video images of military equipment, then it is transferred to real objects (applied to clothes, cars, posters, etc.). In the collective linguistic consciousness of the people, an ""associative nebula""of the symbol is formed: Z is a symbol of a military operation and a symbol of victory. The formation of a polyinterpretable symbolic meaning is facilitated by numerous publications that proclaim the mystical connection of the sign Z with the letters of the Old Slavonic, Old Russian, and Church Slavonic alphabets, with various zoomorphic images, the number 7, the names of ancient gods, the names of temples, etc. The analysis of lexical material contributes to the disclosure of the functional potential of the Z-symbol in the Russian verbal and cultural space of recent years. The need of many people to indicate belonging to a certain worldview led to the widespread use of the sign: in the names of Internet publics and accounts, patriotic events as well as in individual literary work (in particular, in the formation of the direction of Z- poetry). Among the considered neologisms and occasionalisms, examples formed using the graphic mechanism of the language game stand out: Zorok Zorok, Zapiski, Zadacha, etc. In order to develop the principles of the lexicographic description of the ""Z-lexicon"", an analysis is made of the content of the concept ""special military operation"", the iconic representative of which is the letter Z. The history of the concept includes various fragments of collective experience, references to which are actively used both in the media and in Internet discourse: military trials, names of commanders, and soldier's feat. Also, in the structure of the concept, a pseudo-historical layer is distinguished, formed by media texts about the mystical origin of the sign Z. In order to identify the features of the conceptual content, stable and regularly reproduced contexts for the use of words and phrases with Z are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to texts created through individual language activity, including poetry, in which two poles of evaluation are clearly distinguished. The paper discusses the thematic diversity of the ""Z-lexicon"", which reflects the new formats of reality that has changed in 2022; the principles of lexicographic representation of the analyzed group of words in neological dictionaries and databases are formulated. © 2023 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

"Scientific writing is assumed to have become more informationally dense over time (Halliday, 1988; Biber and Gray, 2016). Given that scientific writing is intended for communication between experts, we hypothesize a tendency towards optimizing language use by striving for a balance between highly informative content and a conventionalized style of writing. We study this by means of fractal analysis, asking whether the degree of informativity has become more persistent with predictable patterns of gradual changes between high vs. low informational content, indicating a trend towards an optimal code for scientific communication. Specifically, surprisal is used to measure informativity and the Hurst exponent is used as a long-term dependence measure for fractality analysis, quantifying the degree of persistence of informativity in scientific texts. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Large language models are trained on increasing quantities of unstructured text, the largest sources of which are scraped from the Web. These Web scrapes are mainly composed of heterogeneous collections of text from multiple domains with minimal documentation. While some work has been done to identify and remove toxic, biased, or sexual language, the topic of personal information (PI) in textual data used for training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is relatively underexplored. In this work, we draw from definitions of PI across multiple countries to define the first PI taxonomy of its kind, categorized by type and risk level. We then conduct a case study on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) and the Pile, to detect some of the highest-risk personal information, such as email addresses and credit card numbers, and examine the differences between automatic and regular expression-based approaches for their detection. We identify shortcomings in modern approaches for PI detection, and propose a reframing of the problem that is informed by global perspectives and the goals in personal information detection. © 2023 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

"It might reasonably be expected that running multiple experiments for the same task using the same data and model would yield very similar results. Recent research has, however, shown this not to be the case for many NLP experiments. In this paper, we report extensive coordinated work by two NLP groups to run the training and testing pipeline for three neural text simplification models under varying experimental conditions, including different random seeds, run-time environments, and dependency versions, yielding a large number of results for each of the three models using the same data and train/dev/test set splits. From one perspective, these results can be interpreted as shedding light on the reproducibility of evaluation results for the three NTS models, and we present an in-depth analysis of the variation observed for different combinations of experimental conditions. From another perspective, the results raise the question of whether the averaged score should be considered the 'true' result for each model. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Personality computing has grown significantly in use, with useful applications emerging in fields of study like human-robot interaction and recommendation systems. Traditional recommendation systems frequently run into issues with free riders, data scarcity, and a lack of understanding of user preferences. By strengthening the grasp of user preferences and increasing the precision of recommendations, the addition of well-established user personality features aids in resolving these problems. Therefore, the goal of this research is to take advantage of personality computing's numerous advantages while overcoming the drawbacks of current recommendation systems. This model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test data because it was trained on pre-processed and padded sequences. By utilising LSTM layers, the model is better able to understand contextual information included in the text input and efficiently capture sequential dependencies.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The Online Social Network has become a part of day-to-day life to such an extent that the textual and multimedia data collected on such platforms can be used to identify the behavioral patterns of individuals and groups both instantaneously as well as over a period of time. This chapter studies the three different online social-network-sensing models prevalent in the literature, namely, Network-Structure Analysis, Text Analysis, and Smartphone Sensing. The chapter explains the three different approaches to online social-network sensing and highlights the state-of-the-art. Network-Structure Analysis, which identifies the key structural properties (such as centrality measures) and their variance across different online social networks, provides a perspective into the growth and community behavior of the network as a whole. Text Analysis, which identifies the context and polarity of textual content shared throughout online social networks, signifies the communicative and community-formative behavior of an individual in the network. Smartphone Sensing, which considers the amount and intensity of online social-network activity using smartphones of an individual, identifies the degree of online social-networking addiction of individuals in a network. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper summarizes the results of experimenting with Universal Dependencies (UD) adaptation of an Unsupervised, Compositional and Recursive (UCR) rule-based approach for Sentiment Analysis (SA) submitted to the Shared Task at Rest-Mex 2023 (Team Olga/LyS-SALSA) (within the IberLEF 2023 conference). By using basic syntactic rules such as rules of modification and negation applied on words from sentiment dictionaries, our approach exploits some advantages of an unsupervised method for SA: (1) interpretability and explainability of SA, (2) robustness across datasets, languages and domains and (3) usability by non-experts in NLP. We compare our approach with other unsupervised approaches of SA that in contrast to our UCR rule-based approach use simple heuristic rules to deal with negation and modification. Our results show a considerable improvement over these approaches. We discuss future improvements of our results by using modality features as another shifting rule of polarity and word disambiguation techniques to identify the right sentiment words. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"The subject of this article is the application of NLP and text-mining methods to the analysis of two large bibliographies: a Polish one, based on the catalogs of the National Library in Warsaw, and a German one, created by the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek. The data in both collections are stored in MARC 21 format, allowing the selection of relevant fields that are used for further processing (basically author, title, and date). The volume of the Polish corpus (after filtering out non-relevant or incomplete items) includes 1.4 mln of records, and that of the German corpus 7.5 mln records. The time span of both bibliographies extends from 1801 to 2021. The aim of the study is to compare the gender distribution of book authors in Polish and German databases over more than two centuries. The proportions of male and female authors since 1801 were calculated automatically, and NLP methods such as document vector embeddings based on deep BERT networks were used to extract topics from titles. The gender of the Polish authors was recognized based on the morphology of the first names, and that of the German authors based on a predefined list. The study found that the proportion of female authors has been steadily increasing both in Poland and in German countries (currently around 43%). However, the topics of women's and men's writings invariably remain different since 1801. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In the framework of perspectivism, analyzing how people perceive pragmatic phenomena, like irony, is relevant for deeply understanding the different points of view, and for creating more robust perspective-aware models. This paper presents a linguistic analysis of irony perception in 11 perspectivist models. Each model is trained on annotations by crowd-sourcing workers different in gender, age, and nationalities. Due to the sparsity of the dataset, we examine the texts classified as ironic and not-ironic by these perspectivist models, and identify linguistic patterns that all perspectives associate with irony. To our knowledge, we are the first to also provide evidence for the different linguistic patterns perceived as ironic by a specific perspective. For example, models trained on data annotated by American and Australian annotators are more inclined to classify a text as ironic when it includes a negative sentiment, while models trained on data annotated by the youngest annotators are particularly influenced by words related to immoral behaviors.

"Text classification is a popular and well-studied problem in Natural Language Processing. Most previous work on text classification has focused on deep neural networks such as LSTMs and CNNs. However, text classification studies using syntactic and semantic information are very limited in the literature. In this study, we propose a model using Graph Attention Network (GAT) that incorporates semantic and syntactic information as input for the text classification task. The semantic representations of UCCA and AMR are used as semantic information and the dependency tree is used as syntactic information. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis show that UCCA-GAT model, which is a semantic-aware model outperforms the AMR-GAT and DEP-GAT, which are semantic and syntax-aware models respectively. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed model to understand the limitations of the representations for the problem. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The subject of the article is the hitherto unexplored process of the creation and publication of the Charter 77 documents – documents that fundamentally presented the opinions and analyses of this most important dissident initiative in Czechoslovakia between 1977 and 1989. They covered the state of human and civil rights in the country, various other social and political issues, and the situation of dissent itself. The author refers to this process as a “workshop”, which he understands figuratively as a thinking and creative environment in which ideas, proposals and suggestions are born and implemented. In order to analyse the functioning of the Chartist “workshop”, he chooses six documents with different content, for the creation of which we have diverse historical sources. Using the examples of the basic document “Declaration of Charter 77” of 1 January 1977, the “Communication of Charter 77” (on the conclusions of the internal discussion on the further work of the Charter from September of the same year), and the position of the spokespersons of Charter 77 (on the discussions on the mission and activities of the Charter from October 1978), the author shows how appropriate ways of further activity were sought within this community and how the written “workshop” rules were enforced. Using a document on the situation of the Roma in Czechoslovakia from December 1978, a so-called “economic” document from May 1979 (known as “Theses on Consumption”), and an analysis of the state of Czechoslovak official historiograpghy from May 1984 (known as “The Right to History”), the author illustrates the Chartists’ problems in adhering to the agreed “workshop” rules, their ability to overcome these problems, and the fact that they “produced” Charter documents in two ways. In the first case, the interested parties created an informal group to work on a topic, then incorporated – selectively – the received comments, and then submitted the text (by themselves or through intermediaries) to the speakers for their signature on behalf of the entire Chartist community. In the second case, the Charter spokespersons “produced” the document by signing their own text or a text they had received without consulting anyone. This was precisely the case with the document “The Right to History” (Právo na dějiny), which provoked widespread controversy among Czechoslovak dissenters. © 2023, Institute of Contemporary History of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

"Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, aims to categorize subjective information in texts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It involves analyzing words to determine emotions expressed in sentences, paragraphs, or documents. The process includes cleaning the text by removing unnecessary characters, stop words, and punctuation, as well as tokenization to divide the text into separate words while maintaining contextual meaning. Analyzing sentiment in Twitter data requires extensive preprocessing, including the removal of unnecessary characters, handling hashtags, and tokenization. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, is an effective technique for sentiment analysis as it captures sequential and contextual information from text data. In this study, an LSTM model is proposed to perform sentimental analysis on Twitter data. The proposed model was able to achieve 93% accuracy with 0.93 F1 score, outperforming other models. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article addresses the challenges of attributing authorship to Mary, Queen of Scots, when editing her letters. It demonstrates how editing Mary’s letters offers evidence for reading early modern letters not as static texts but as evidence of the processes of early modern epistolary composition (namely, the collaborative nature of letter-writing in the period) and within a historicised understanding of authorship. An analysis of a range of Mary’s letters, from those written in her own hand, through to contemporary decipherment of coded letters, is offered to highlight the editorial challenges of her surviving correspondence. Close study of epistolary features such as signatures, script and handwriting, as well as an interrogation of the material features of Mary’s letters, suggests the benefits of a more practical approach to future editing of the correspondence. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Social media provides a public platform for expressing complaints and opinions. Researchers can use text mining techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling on social media data to compare features and gauge public opinion on competing digital banks in Indonesia. The aim of this study is to classify sentiments and identify topics in social media data related to a specific digital bank. To accomplish this, the Naïve Bayes algorithm is used for sentiment analysis, while Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used for topic modeling. The social media data is sourced from Twitter and Instagram for Line Bank digital bank. The study finds that the Naïve Bayes algorithm performs well in classifying sentiments, achieving a maximum F1 score of 0.863. Positive sentiments are more prevalent in Twitter data, while negative sentiments are more prevalent on Instagram. Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm identifies four optimal topics for positive sentiment and five for negative sentiment. The coherence value obtained is 0.426279 for positive sentiment and 0.397232 for negative sentiment.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The effectiveness of contrastive learning technology in natural language processing tasks is yet to be explored and analyzed. How to construct positive and negative samples correctly and reasonably is the core challenge of contrastive learning. It is even harder to discover contrastive objects in multi-label text classification tasks. There are very few contrastive losses proposed previously. In this paper, we investigate the problem from a different angle by proposing five novel contrastive losses for multi-label text classification tasks. These are Strict Contrastive Loss (SCL), Intra-label Contrastive Loss (ICL), Jaccard Similarity Contrastive Loss (JSCL), Jaccard Similarity Probability Contrastive Loss (JSPCL), and Stepwise Label Contrastive Loss (SLCL). We explore the effectiveness of contrastive learning for multilabel text classification tasks by the employment of these novel losses and provide a set of baseline models for deploying contrastive learning techniques on specific tasks. We further perform an interpretable analysis of our approach to show how different components of contrastive learning losses play their roles. The experimental results show that our proposed contrastive losses can bring improvement to multi-label text classification tasks. Our work also explores how contrastive learning should be adapted for multi-label text classification tasks. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Hybrid Question-Answering (HQA), which targets reasoning over tables and passages linked from table cells, has witnessed significant research in recent years. A common challenge in HQA and other passage-table QA datasets is that it is generally unrealistic to iterate over all table rows, columns, and linked passages to retrieve evidence. Such a challenge made it difficult for previous studies to show their reasoning ability in retrieving answers. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Table-alignment-based Cell-selection and Reasoning model (TACR) for hybrid text and table QA, evaluated on the HybridQA and WikiTableQuestions datasets. In evidence retrieval, we design a table-question-alignment enhanced cell-selection method to retrieve fine-grained evidence. In answer reasoning, we incorporate a QA module that treats the row containing selected cells as context. Experimental results over the HybridQA and WikiTableQuestions (WTQ) datasets show that TACR achieves state-of-the-art results on cell selection and outperforms fine-grained evidence retrieval baselines on HybridQA, while achieving competitive performance on WTQ. We also conducted a detailed analysis to demonstrate that being able to align questions to tables in the cell-selection stage can result in important gains from experiments of over 90% table row and column selection accuracy, meanwhile also improving output explainability. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2023 Task 4, ValueEval: Identification of Human Values behind Arguments. The aim of this task is to identify whether or not an input text supports each of the 20 pre-defined human values. Previous work on human value detection has shown the effectiveness of a sequence classification approach using BERT. However, little is known about what type of task formulation is suitable for the task. To this end, this paper explores various task formulations, including sequence classification, question answering, and question answering with chain-of-thought prompting and evaluates their performances on the shared task dataset. Experiments show that a zero-shot approach is not as effective as other methods, and there is no one approach that is optimal in every scenario. Our analysis also reveals that utilizing the descriptions of human values can help to improve performance. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"This paper describes our system used for subtask C (1 & 2) in Task 6: LegalEval: Understanding Legal Texts. We propose a three-level encoder-based classification architecture that works by fine-tuning a BERT-based pre-trained encoder, and post-processing the embeddings extracted from its last layers, using transformer encoder layers and RNNs. We run ablation studies on the same and analyze its performance. To extract the explanations for the predicted class we develop an explanation extraction algorithm, exploiting the idea of a model’s occlusion sensitivity. We explored some training strategies with a detailed analysis of the dataset. Our system ranked 2nd (macro-F1 metric) for its sub-task C-1 and 7th (ROUGE-2 metric) for sub-task C-2. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In natural language processing, cleaning up a lot of scraped text data is an important step that involves getting rid of irrelevant and noisy data from the text corpus. Text data obtained from web scraping or other sources may contain various unwanted elements such as HTML tags, non-textual characters, and punctuation marks, which can negatively impact the accuracy and efficiency of NLP algorithms. The study simplifies obtaining text data from multiple websites by employing TxtPrePro, a simple pipeline for scraping and text preprocessing that can be used for topic modeling, text summarization, sentiment analysis and other purposes. The proposed method used web scraping to collect a large amount of text data then performed proper text preprocessing, obtained some information such as tables visualizations and obtained a cleaned corpus.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This paper describes our fine-tuned pretrained language model for task 9 (Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis, MTIA) of the SemEval 2023 competition. MTIA aims to quantitatively analyze tweets in 6 languages for intimacy, giving a score from 1 to 5. The challenge of MTIA is in semantically extracting information from code-mixed texts. To alleviate this difficulty, we suggested a solution that combines attention and memory mechanisms. The preprocessed tweets are input to the XLM-T layer to get sentence embeddings and subsequently to the bidirectional GRU layer to obtain intimacy ratings. Experimental results show an improvement in the overall performance of our model in both seen and unseen languages. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"The digitization inheritance of national sports culture is an inevitable requirement of the new era, so studying its communication characteristics in the digital age is necessary. In this paper, the cognitive semantics of its cultural imagery is obtained based on the analysis of the connotation of national sports culture, and the informational imagery is extracted based on the cultural semantic analysis. The fast gradient descent algorithm optimizes the sampling and dissemination process of information during establishing the SIRI communication network for cultural imagery. Changes in the state and popularity of the dissemination nodes were explored by changing the external social environment and the input of the information carrier. When the probability of social environment increases from 0.15 to 0.95, the node with state S transforms into an information dissemination node faster and finally tends to a stable value of 0. In terms of information carriers, the degree of the flow of video dissemination will be graded higher than other carriers, and the popularity of video dissemination is 2.45%, 3.14%, and 5.21% higher than audio, image, and text, respectively, when the dissemination reaches the 4th generation. The information dissemination model optimized using a gradient descent algorithm can accurately capture the dissemination characteristics of national sports culture, thus proposing a better information transmission path.  © 2023 Yefei Liu et al., published by Sciendo 2023."
"Court Judgement Prediction with Explanation (CJPE) is a task in the field of legal analysis and evaluation, which involves predicting the outcome of a court case based on the available legal text and providing a detailed explanation of the prediction. This is an important task in the legal system as it can aid in decision-making and improve the efficiency of the court process. In this paper, we present a new approach to understanding legal texts, which are normally long documents, based on data-oriented methods. Specifically, we first try to exploit the characteristic of data to understand the legal texts. The output is then used to train the model using the Longformer architecture. Regarding the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated on the sub-task CJPE of the SemEval-2023 Task 6. Accordingly, our method achieves top 1 and top 2 on the classification task and explanation task, respectively. Furthermore, we present several open research issues for further investigations in order to improve the performance in this research field. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Most datasets for multimodal emotion recognition only have one emotion annotation for all the modalities combined, which serves as a gold standard for single modalities. This procedure ignores, however, the fact that each modality constitutes a unique perspective that contains its own clues. Moreover, as in unimodal emotion analysis, the perspectives of annotators can also diverge in a multimodal setup. In this paper, we therefore propose to annotate each modality independently and to more closely investigate how perspectives between modalities and annotators diverge. Moreover, we also explore the role of annotator training on perspectivism. We find that for the different unimodal levels, the annotations made on text resemble most closely those of the multimodal setup. Furthermore, we see that annotator training has a positive influence on the annotator agreement in modalities with lower agreement scores, but it also reduces the variety of perspectives. We therefore suggest that a moderate training which still values the individual perspectives of annotators might be beneficial before starting annotations. Finally, we observe that negative sentiment and emotions tend to be annotated more inconsistently across the different modality setups. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"This article introduces FLICs, a novel dataset designed for modeling informal language. Predominantly composed of text in Malagasy and French, FLICs were collected from Facebook and cleansed using Python scraping techniques. The aim is to address the lack of linguistic diversity in existing datasets by offering over 800,000 informal texts, enabling an understanding of current linguistic trends in informal communication. FLICs stands out for its inclusion of features characteristic of informal communication, such as abbreviations, dialects, slang, emoticons, and keywords. Moreover, it highlights the less-studied Malagasy language, used in an extremely informal manner and interwoven with French through code-switching. This linguistic variety opens new avenues for research in NLP, particularly in text comprehension, generation, and classification. To validate the new dataset, we employed FastText, a word embedding model, to capture word semantics within the corpus. Analyses demonstrated data relevance. Semantic relationships between words were faithfully captured using pre-trained FastText word embeddings. The informal word contexts were explored through clustering word vectors obtained using K-means and PCA. Subsequently, validation extended to utilizing pre-trained FastText embeddings in text generation with an LSTM model. This experiment confirmed the usefulness of embeddings in consistently and appropriately generating informal texts. In summary, these contributions enrich the available resources for research in natural language processing within the realm of informal language. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Introduction: the article is part of a complex of research aimed at study of the motif structure of a Mansi fairy tale. In this paper, the attention is focused on the representation of the motif of the death of the forest giant Mēŋkv and the analysis of his attributes. Objective: to reveal the ways of representation of the motif of the death of the forest giant in the Mansi fairy-tale texts; to explain the semantics of attributes. Research materials: texts of the Mansi fairy tales published in folklore collections, as well as the author’s field material and reports of informants. Results and novelty of the research: the scientific novelty of the work is justified by the very formulation of the problem: on the basis of folklore data, the motif of the death of the character is revealed; for the first time an analysis of the attributes of death is carried out. It was determined that the motif of the death of the Mēŋkv (forest giant) is realized in several versions of the plots. They present various attributes of death: an iron crowbar heated on fire, cedar arrows or arrows with burning tips, fire, birch bark mask, which semantically go back to the mythology of the people. © 2023 Ob-Ugric Institute of Applied Researches and Development.

"Sentiment analysis and thematic unsupervised classification of tourist texts have gained importance in recent years. Rest-Mex 2023 proposes two tasks: sentiment analysis and thematic unsupervised classification of Mexican tourist texts. The thematic unsupervised classification task aims to group texts related to Mexican tourism into four distinct topics.

"Social media involvement in human life is becoming huge where people can express their feelings and opinions. Sentiment analysis (SA) is a method of analysing, handling, concluding, and inferencing subjective texts with the sentiment. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) acts an important part in understanding people's opinions and sentiments towards various aspects of products or services. The main key challenges faced in ABSA are product dependent, target dependent, aspect dependent. In this work, a hybrid approach that combines the power of BERT for aspect extraction and diverse ML classifiers for SA. First, a set of diverse ML classifiers used to analyze the sentiment associated with each extracted aspect. By utilizing multiple classifiers, we aim to enhance the robustness and generalization of sentiment classification. Each classifier is trained on a different feature representation, such as PMI, bag-of-words and TF-IDF to capture various aspects of the textual data. Later, BERT leveraged to identify and extract relevant aspects from text. BERT's contextualized embeddings extracts the meaning of words in the context of the sentence, enabling accurate aspect extraction. To evaluate the proposed hybrid approach, trained model is experimented on three benchmark datasets which are based on Amazon reviews, Twitter and TripAdvisor datasets. Our results demonstrate that the combination of BERT for aspect extraction and SVM classifier significantly improves the accuracy of 96.91%, 95.63%, 95.66% on three datasets compared to traditional approaches.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This work presents the approach developed by the DUTH team for participating in the SemEval-2023 Task 9: Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis. Our results show that pre-processing techniques do not affect the learning performance for the task of multilingual intimacy analysis. In addition, we show that fine-tuning a transformer-based model does not provide advantages over using the pre-trained model to generate text embeddings and using the resulting representations to train simpler and more efficient models such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Finally, we utilize an ensemble of classifiers, including three MLPs with different architectures and a CatBoost model, to improve the regression accuracy. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Sentiment research encompasses all aspects of identifying, interpreting, and evaluating people's attitudes toward different events, problems, administrations, or other topics. Sentiment analysis is a more extensive portrayal of an examination field, which considers emotional processing applied to text-based investigation. In this sense, it additionally incorporates the differentiation into subjective or objective statements and, more recently, the field of emotion analysis. The key aim of this analysis is to see how the sentiment task influences the success of the emotion-detector task in suicide notes in a multitask environment. Suicide has become a significant public-health issue and a leading cause of death across the globe. While most suicides can be averted with timely intervention, early detection and treatment of at-risk individuals have been an enormous challenge. A suicide note is an appropriate source of emotionally charged content for convenient study of the mental health of a suicide attempter. The lack of enough data has handicapped the growth of research using computational methods in this domain. Emotion detection and sentiment detection, two very closely related activities, are crucial in determining the victims' emotional state. This article proposes a deep multitask learning algorithm that models emotion recognition (the primary task) and sentiment detection simultaneously (the secondary task). We implement three attention-based deep-learning architectures (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)) each for the single-task and multitasking problem. Shared sentence-representation layers and a standard function layer are accompanied by two task-specific layers and the corresponding output layers in multitasking architectures. We perform our experiments on the CEASE Corpus, a fine-grained emotion annotated dataset of 2393 sentences in English taken from 205 real-life suicide notes. Each sentence is annotated with one of the 15 fine-grained emotion labels. Experiments on this dataset reveal that our proposed model outperforms the multitask Bi-LSTM-based framework with a 60.76% precision. The evaluation findings demonstrate that all of our multitask models outperform their single-task alternatives, demonstrating the importance of the sentiment-detection task (i.e., the secondary task) that plays an essential role in assisting the emotion-detection task (i.e., primary task) when both tasks are learned jointly. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"Predicting the type of Saudi court is helpful for illegal people to know which court is suitable for filing proceedings. However, it isn't very easy to expect judicial courts in Saudi law because they need a data set of cases. This requires the extraction of valuable information from countless other cases and documents. Moreover, the complexity of Saudi law, coupled with a large volume of litigation, makes this problem more difficult to predict. This paper presents the predictions of the courts of the first instance in Saudi law where the user writes the text of the case to be analyzed and then predicts the type of court suitable for this case. Our methodology uses machine learning algorithms. The prototype obtained 98.36% accuracy using the xgboost algorithm, which was applied to 607 diverse judges in cases of the General Court and the Criminal Court out of five trial courts in Saudi law. © 2023 IEEE."
"Existing solutions to zero-shot text classification either conduct prompting with pre-trained language models, which is sensitive to the choices of templates, or rely on large-scale annotated data of relevant tasks for meta-tuning. In this work, we propose a new paradigm based on self-supervised learning to solve zero-shot text classification tasks by tuning the language models with unlabeled data, called self-supervised tuning. By exploring the inherent structure of free texts, we propose a new learning objective called first sentence prediction to bridge the gap between unlabeled data and text classification tasks. After tuning the model to learn to predict the first sentence in a paragraph based on the rest, the model is able to conduct zero-shot inference on unseen tasks such as topic classification and sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on 7 out of 10 tasks. Moreover, the analysis reveals that our model is less sensitive to the prompt design.

"User generated content (UGC) is a valuable resource for the multi-criteria decision-making process. Platforms, such as TripAdvisor, enable the registration of comments and post rankings. However, existing ranking mechanisms are not transparent, making it impossible to evaluate their integrity and accuracy. Additionally, it has been shown that these rankings are, in some cases, inaccurate and misleading. This prompted the need for developing a ranking mechanism based on UGC to capture experiences and feelings, rather than quantitative data (bubbles/stars). The proposed ranking mechanism employs LDA to generate topics, which are transformed with fuzzy logic to variables, used to produce ranking results. We empirically studied the proposed ranking mechanism using TripAdvisor's user comments on a sample of restaurants located in Athens, Greece and compared the results to a simple quantitative ranking scheme. In some cases, the ranking differed. Further investigation is needed to address the limitations encountered in this research.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"Financial and economic news is continuously monitored due to their impact on future stock prices. Thus, the polarity extraction from the news is a very relevant task for investment decision-making by traders. In this sense, Sentiment Analysis models can provide accurate methods to extract signals that influence this decision-making. In this work, we describe the contribution to IberLEF 2023 Challenge - FinancES, where we proposed a hybrid approach that addresses the targeted sentiment analysis by creating a pipeline with different phases. First, a phase for cleaning texts, followed by an entity recognition phase and, finally, the polarity extraction. The hybrid approach combines different models to proceed with each phase. Thus, RoBERTa transformer architecture is employed as a NER, BETO transformer model is employed for polarity analysis, and, finally, a Spanish Spacy model is used for the part-of-speech tagging process. Although the proposed approach has still scope for improvement, since it reached mid-table positions in the leaderboard, it put forwards a different method to carry out the proposed classification tasks. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"The article considers some principles of describing affixoids, especially prefixoids, in neological academic lexicography. Academic neography (neological academic lexicography) is a direction that appeared in the 1960s at the Institute for Linguistic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The founder of this direction is Nadezhda Z. Kotelova, who created a typology of dictionaries of new words (iling.spb.ru/departments/14). The linguistic part of the article discusses prefixoids – a borderline morphological and word-forming phenomenon that has attracted the attention of linguists since the 1960s. The article analyzes compound words formed with prefixoids to see the characteristics of prefixoids of the 1990s – early 2020s. The research material are three types of neological dictionaries, a neological database of the Institute for Linguistic Studies, the Integrum text database. The analysis of prefixoids in terms of structure and part-of-speech belonging made it possible to identify 24 variants of formants. As the statistics based on the continuous sampling method show, prefixoiding is the most active way of forming compound words in modern Russian: words formed this way make up half of the total vocabulary (two dictionaries of the New in Russian Vocabulary. Dictionary Materials series were analyzed). The combinatorial ability of prefixoids has increased compared to the end of the 20th century. This type of word formation covers all styles and spheres, including colloquial and substandard vocabulary. The article summarizes the ways of describing affixoids, in particular prefixoids, in the dictionaries of neological academic lexicography; dictionary entries are subjected to such an analysis for the first time. The structure of entries describing prefixoids since the mid-1990s is also described. Based on the analysis of dictionary entries describing affixoids in neography, in 2022, a team of researchers of the Institute for Linguistic Studies created an electronic lexicographic resource (affixoid.iling.spb.ru). The database contains about 700 prefixoids and 200 suffixoids. As the best way to generalize and unify materials on affixoids, in particular the most active category of prefixoids, a lexicographic presentation of the material was chosen. The entry of the electronic resource was based on Affixoids of the Russian Language. Experience of a Reference Dictionary edited by Evgeny Levashov. The resource is intended for linguists, specialists in the field of Russian lexicology, lexicography, word formation and morphemics, as well as for the widest audience. The scientific potential of the resource and its main purpose is to summarize in lexicographic form information about Russian affixoids, as well as to unify their semantic description. The resource is also an auxiliary tool for creating word-formation references in the main neological electronic resource neolex.iling.spb.ru. © Ю.С. Ридецкая, 2023."
"Automatic Term Recognition is used to extract domain-specific terms that belong to a given domain. In order to be accurate, these corpus and language-dependent methods require large volumes of textual data that need to be processed to extract candidate terms that are afterward scored according to a given metric. To improve text preprocessing and candidate terms extraction and scoring, we propose a distributed Spark-based architecture to automatically extract domain-specific terms. The main contributions are as follows: (1) propose a novel distributed automatic domain-specific multi-word term recognition architecture built on top of the Spark ecosystem; (2) perform an in-depth analysis of our architecture in terms of accuracy and scalability; (3) design an easy-to-integrate Python implementation that enables the use of Big Data processing in fields such as Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

"Recruitment is one of the company's most important and crucial tasks. A company needs to select the best person for the job who has all the skills to fulfil the duties. A resume is a reflection of a person's abilities. These days, companies receive an enormous number of applications for a job. Traditional recruiting methods such as analyzing and class manually analysing and classifying resumes are becoming consuming a lot of time. So, there is a need for automation of the resume analysis and classification phase. The automation should work in such a way that it will take resumes, job roles, and job descriptions as input and classify whether the resumes are suitable for the job or not. This can be done with the help of text analysis and classification algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The question of how we should resolve conflicts between the demands that arise from general morality and those derived from a particular professional role (for example, that of a lawyer) is one of the traditional problems of professional ethics. The aim of this article is to provide an answer to this question on the basis of consequentialist ethics, or a specific variant of it, which is based on utilitarianism and whose operation in practice is closer to pragmatic reasoning. In the text, the author first discusses the very nature of the above conflict, then critically analyses some of the existing approaches to its resolution, and finally presents the starting point offered by the pragmatic utilitarianism he proposes here. It has plausible norma-tive foundations, as well as a good ability to resolve moral conflicts and various kinds of trade-offs. Above all, it allows us to maintain rationality in our decision-making processes and it can also organically take into account the plurality of moral attitudes that is often seen as a key characteristic of contemporary Western societies.

"Background: Concerns have been raised about the inconsistency and quality of pre-service teacher preparation, especially in reading literacy. Mixed-reality simulations can potentially revolutionise initial teacher education by offering realistic, risk-free practice opportunities to master reading practices. Objectives: This study explores pre-service teachers’ perceptions of: (1) interacting with avatars, (2) teaching core reading skills, particularly eliciting background information on informational text, and (3) using an action review cycle within a mixed-reality simulation environment. Method: A qualitative exploratory case study design was used in this study in order to document pre-service teachers’ perceptions of engaging within a mixed-reality simulation environment. A purposive sampling strategy was used to select participants for this study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Findings reveal that pre-service teachers valued interacting with the avatars and appreciated the unique focus on eliciting learners’ background knowledge, a core reading practice. They typically teach full lessons with limited genuine engagement during microteaching opportunities, making this an interesting experience. They highlighted the mixed-reality simulation’s features, such as pausing, redoing, and receiving immediate feedback. The simulator allowed them to concentrate on skill mastery rather than staging lessons for grades. Conclusion: This study concludes that pre-service teachers’ skill development benefits from deliberate practice opportunities designed to enhance complex skills. Mixed-reality simulations could reshape how student teachers are prepared for reading instruction. Contributions: This research contributes to the understanding of pre-service teachers’ perspectives on teaching core reading practices in a mixed-reality simulation environment. © 2023 AOSIS (Pty) Ltd.

The method of case analysis for examining the operations of the Viber channel of Mariupol citizens during and after the siege of the city was applied in this article. A relational content analysis of text messages and meta-data of the channel were conducted. The resulting empirical material was conceptualized in the logic of thematization of basic models of democracy and their criticism. The Viber channel media community during wartime was considered in the context of the concepts of the natural state and the social contract. A special place is occupied by the optics of the diversity of forms of “grassroots democracy” and their localization. In terms of “networks of trust” in the context of the opposition of “democratization–de-democratization” (Charles Tilly) and the search for a “deliberation sense of community” (Joseph Bessette). The non-political nature of grassroots movements of media communities and their homology to the decentralization reform in Ukraine are emphasized. © 2023 Foundation for Good Politics
"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, although beneficial for data collection and analysis, can also facilitate scientific fraud. AI detectors can help resolve this problem, but their effectiveness depends on their ability to track AI progress. In addition, many methods of evading AI detection exist and their constantly evolving sophistication can make the task more difficult. Thus, from an AI-generated text, we wanted to: (1) evaluate the AI detection sites on a text generated entirely by the AI, (2) test the methods described for evading AI detection, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of these methods to evade AI detection on the sites tested previously. Hypothesis: Not all AI detection tools are equally effective in detecting AI-generated text and some techniques used to evade АI detection can make an AI-produced text almost undetectable. Materials and methods: We created a text with ChatGPT-4 (Chat Gеnеrаtivе Prе-trained Transformer) and submitted it to 11 АI detection web tools (Оriginаlity, ZеrоGPT, Writеr, Cоpylеаks, Crоssplag, GPTZеrо, Sapling, Cоntеnt аt scаlе, Cоrrеctоr, Writеfull еt Quill), bеfоrе аnd аftеr applying strategies to minimise AI detection. The strategies used to minimize AI detection were the improvement of command messages in ChatPGT, the introduction of minor grammatical errors such as comma deletion, paraphrasing, and the substitution of Latin letters with similar Cyrillic letters (a and о) which is also a method used elsewhere to evade the detection of plagiarism. We have also tested the effectiveness of these tools in correctly identifying a scientific text written by a human in 1960. Results: From the initial text generated by the AI, 7 of the 11 detectors concluded that the text was mainly written by humans. Subsequently, the introduction of simple modifications, such as the removal of commas or paraphrasing can effectively reduce AI detection and make the text appear human for all detectors. In addition, replacing certain Latin letters with Cyrillic letters can make an AI text completely undetectable. Finally, we observe that in a paradoxical way, certain sites detect a significant proportion of AI in a text written by a human in 1960. Discussion: AI detectors have low efficiency, and simple modifications can allow even the most robust detectors to be easily bypassed. The rapid development of generative AI raises questions about the future of scientific writing but also about the detection of scientific fraud, such as data fabrication.

"Text mining and information retrieval are fundamentally dependent on the selection of text feature items. Features must be created manually for use in traditional feature extraction methods. While it may take a lot of effort to manually build an effective feature, deep learning makes it possible to automatically learn new representations of successful features from training data in the context of new applications. Text mining has made a lot of progress thanks to deep learning, which is a new way to find features. Deep learning is different from more traditional methods because it automatically learns features from large datasets, while the latter adopts handcrafted features, which rely heavily on the prior knowledge of designers and thus make it nearly impossible to take advantage of large datasets. Feature representation in deep learning may be automatically taught using big data, which typically consists of millions of parameters. This thesis starts with a brief overview of the most common ways to extract text features. It then talks about the widespread use of deep learning methods in text feature extraction and their applications. Finally, it makes some predictions about the future of deep learning's role in feature extraction.  © 2023 IEEE."
"On the disputed territory of Brazilian literature (Dalcastagnè, 2012), what is the place occupied by slam poetry? Moreover, in this possible space, what is the position of black and female authorship? Addressing these questions implies considering a cultural scenario that is organized outside the national literary field; therefore, it means dealing with issues related to power relations inherent in a historically unequal society, as is the Brazilian one, and the role that poetic production can play in this context. Based on these questions, the general objective of this article is to reflect on the slam poetry produced in Brazil by black female authors in the context of contemporary Brazilian literature and on the impact of these poems as texts capable of problematizing the literary criticism scenario, besides presenting the reading and analysis of Tawane Theodoro (2019b)’s slam poetry “O peso das palavras”, in the light of this debate. © 2023 Universidade de Brasilia.

"The present work resumes the participation of the UMSNH Team at RestMex 2023. Our approach aims to categorize tourist destination reviews in Cuba, Colombia, and Mexico in three different aspects: the country to which the attraction belongs, the type of attraction, and the level of tourist satisfaction. For this purpose, a variety of different Word-Embeddings (FastText, μ-TC, BERT) will be used to generate a baseline, after which combinations of these will be assembled using XGBoost to try to improve on their individual results. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"In this paper, we first study the representation of news text, build the content tree using the CTWE text method, and combine the word vector with the interrelationship between words in the content tree. Then, a feature word extraction technique is applied to filter key information, and Single-pass hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to classify the news content, and a data mining algorithm is applied to realize news delivery. Finally, the impact of information's initial value and credibility on the transmission process is examined, and the model's feasibility and practicality are assessed. The results show that the RMSE value of the data mining model is 0.0408, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.9334, and the cosine similarity is 0.9596, and the model in this paper has the smallest deviation from the real data and the greatest similarity compared with other models. This study confirms the unique advantages of the data mining model in news dissemination.  © 2023 Xin Liu, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Web-blogging sites such as Twitter and Facebook are heavily influenced by emotions, sentiments, and data in the modern era. Twitter, a widely used microblogging site where individuals share their thoughts in the form of tweets, has become a major source for sentiment analysis. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in demand for sentiment analysis to identify and classify opinions or expressions in text or tweets. Opinions or expressions of people about a particular topic, situation, person, or product can be identified from sentences and divided into three categories: positive for good, negative for bad, and neutral for mixed or confusing opinions. The process of analyzing changes in sentiment and the combination of these categories is known as “sentiment analysis.” In this study, sentiment analysis was performed on a dataset of 90,000 tweets using both deep learning and machine learning methods. The deep learning-based model long-short-term memory (LSTM) performed better than machine learning approaches. Long short-term memory achieved 87% accuracy, and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved slightly worse results than LSTM at 86%. The study also tested binary classes of positive and negative, where LSTM and SVM both achieved 90% accuracy. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved."
"Objective: To summarize the evidence on the efficacy of aquatic therapy on motor and social skill as well as executive function compared with land-based exercises in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Data Sources: The following 6 databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Google scholar (advance), and Web of Science from 1990 to June 2022. Study Selection: The search included only clinical trials. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text and conducted manuscript selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Data Extraction: Using standardized forms, data were extracted and all points of disagreement were discussed between authors. Data Synthesis: Data synthesis was applied to summarize information from the included trials. The quantitative analysis incorporated fixed-effect models. Of the 150 studies identified in the initial search, 16 trials (248 children) met the eligibility criteria. Aquatic therapy improved factors related to the Humphries’ Assessment of Aquatic Readiness (HAAR) checklist such as mental adjustment (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.19; I2=10%) compared with land-based exercises (control), water environment (SMD, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.43-1.54; I2=83%), Rotation (SMD, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.14-1.12; I2=0%), balance and control (SMD, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.47-2.72; I2=36%) and independent movement (eg, walking, moving upper body, standing, transferring) in water (SMD, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.37-1.38; I2=0%) compared with the control group in the 4 trails. The HAAR tool is based on the Halliwick method and aims to assess the appropriateness for an individual with disability to engage in aquatic therapy. The study protocol was also registered with PROSPERO number CRD42022341898. Conclusion: Aquatic therapy demonstrated a more robust positive effect on factors related to the HAAR checklist than land-based exercises. Further research is needed to further elucidate the clinical utility of aquatic therapy for children with neurodevelopmental disorder at long-term follow-up. © 2023 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine"
"Objectives: To systematically synthesize the views of community-dwelling Asians on Advance care planning and to summarize the factors and reasons affecting their uptake of ACP. Design: Mixed-methods systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42018091033). Setting and Participants: Asian adults (≥18 years old) living in the community globally. Methods: Medline (Ovid), Web of Science, CINAHL (EBSCO), Open Grey, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 30, 2022. Qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods studies reporting on the views of non–seriously ill community-dwelling Asian adults on ACP or the factors influencing their ACP uptake were included. Secondary research, studies not published in English, or studies not available as full text were excluded. Two independent teams of researchers extracted data, assessed methodologic quality, and performed the data analysis. Data analysis was conducted using the multistep convergent integrated approach based on Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for mixed-methods systematic review. Results: Fifty-eight studies were included. Non–seriously ill community-dwelling Asians were willing to engage in ACP (46.5%-84.4%) although their awareness (3.1%-42.9%) and uptake of ACP remained low (14.0%-53.4%). Background factors (sociodemographic factors, and health status, as well as experience and exposure to information) and underlying beliefs (attitude toward ACP, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) were found to affect their uptake of ACP. A conceptual framework was developed to facilitate a proper approach to ACP for this population. Conclusions and Implications: A flexible approach toward ACP is needed for non–seriously ill community-dwelling Asians. There is also a need to raise end-of-life and ACP literacy, and to explore ways to narrow the gap in the expectations and implementation of ACP so that trust in its effective execution can be built. © 2023 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine"
"This paper describes experiments in the automated analysis of Guarani-Spanish code-switched text as part of a shared task at IberLEF2023. The submission includes results for all three tasks: (1) language identification, (2) named-entity classification, and (3) Spanish code classification. A CRF trained on text features and several neural network approaches using pre-trained multilingual representations are evaluated. We find that fine-tuning the multilingual representations using unlabeled monolingual Guarani data is beneficial for all the three tasks, and that multi-task training achieves the best results for task 2. The systems described here achieved first place in all three tasks. Interestingly, we did not see a performance boost by replacing multilingual BERT with a pre-trained language model that specifically targets indigenous languages of the Americas. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"The emergence of artificial intelligence language services has raised hopes related to facilitating the task of publication activity. Members of the academic community wondered whether chatbots could optimize the process of scientific writing. ChatGPT, a language model capable of, among other things, generating scholarly texts, received particular attention. The cases of writing academic papers using ChatGPT have led to a number of publications analyzing the pros and cons of using this neural network. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using ChatGPT to write an introduction to a scientific paper on a topical issue of the Arctic governance. A set of queries to ChatGPT network, based on the logic of the commonly accepted in academia publication format IMRAD, has being developed. This format is characterized by structural and functional elements, which served as a logical basis for the queries. The responses received from ChatGPT were analyzed for their compliance with the requirements for a scientific article, according to the IMRAD publication format. The result of the analysis showed that ChatGPT is not able to meet the requirements for publishing a scientific article in the modern scientific publication discourse. © 2023 Moscow Polytechnic University.

"This paper presents the participation of the SINAI team in the MEDDOPLACE shared task, held on IberLEF2023, focusing on detecting, normalizing, and classifying various types of places and related information in Spanish clinical case reports. Our team tackled all four sub-tasks. For named entity recognition, recurrent classifiers trained on contextual embeddings from a pre-trained RoBERTa language model outperformed the baseline, achieving F1-score of 0.8512. In the second sub-task, a combination of string matching, transformer-based embeddings, TF-IDF character-based n-gram, and Levenshtein distances yielded promising results, albeit with room for further analysis and improvement. On the entity classification sub-task we achieved a micro-average accuracy of 0.7694 by fine-tuning the RoBERTa model. Our team also presented three pipeline versions for end-to-end classification, incorporating variations in the NER component. Notably, the best-performing pipeline achieved F1-score of 0.6272. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"This study offers a selective overview of the most important methodological approaches and theoretical concepts relevant to the study of musical meaning which have emerged in the Anglo-American musicological tradition since the 1990s. It takes as its starting point the work of Lawrence Kramer, which represents the conceptual underpinnings of New Musicology, and continues with Michael Klein’s study of musical intertextuality, which helps to further illustrate the implications of post-modern philosophy for the hermeneutical interpretation of music. A significant portion of the text is dedicated to Robert Hatten’s work on markedness, correlation, gestures, topics, and tropes. The discussion of the topic theory also covers the contributions made by Raymond Monelle, Danuta Mirka, and others. The overview continues with Esti Sheinberg’s theory of musical incongruities and her typology of modes of semantic ambiguity, including irony, satire, parody, and the grotesque. To complement the traditional text-based approach to musical meaning, this overview also considers meanings communicated through the movements of the human body, referencing Nicholas Cook’s thoughts on embodied cognition and Robert Hatten’s approach to interpreting musical gestures encoded in a musical text. Attention is also paid to the line of thinking leading from Edward T. Cone’s ideas on the presence of different voices and personae in seemingly singular musical works, through Fred Maus’s conception of music in terms of dramatic interaction of musical agents, to Hatten’s theory of virtual agency. This is followed by the summary of Byron Almén’s theory of musical narrative, i.e. the capacity of music to articulate a trajectory leading from one state to another, propelled by the dynamic forces of conflict and resolution. Subsequent chapters discuss the relevance of recent approaches to the study of musical form (William Caplin, James Hepokoski, Warren Darcy) and the possibilities/limits of musical narrative in music since 1900, in which the conventional principles of syntax (tonality, form, motivic/thematic structure) are often questioned. In the closing section, the author returns to Kramer’s ideas, takes a stance with regard to the opposition of semiotic and hermeneutic approaches, and discusses ethical issues associated with the act of interpretation (and misinterpretation). © Ústav dějin umění, Akademie věd České republiky, v. v. i."
"Background: Domestic violence is a global public health concern as stated by World Health Organization. We aimed to conduct a textual analysis of tweets associated with domestic violence through keyword identification, word trends and word collocations. The data was obtained from Twitter, focusing on publicly available tweets written in English. The objectives are to find out if the identified keywords, word trends and word collocations can help differentiate between domestic violence-related tweets and non-domestic violence-related tweets, as well as, to analyze the textual characteristics of domestic violence-related tweets and non-domestic violence-related tweets. Methods: Overall, 11,041 tweets were collected using a few keywords over a period of 15 days from 22 March 2021 to 5 April 2021. A text analysis approach was used to discover the most frequent keywords used, the word trends of those keywords and the word collocations of the keywords in differentiating between domestic violence-related or non-domestic violence-related tweets. Results: Domestic violence-related tweets and non-domestic violence-related tweets had differentiating characteristics, despite sharing several main keywords. In particular, keywords like “domestic”, “violence” and “suicide” featured prominently in domestic-violence related tweets but not in non-domestic violence-related tweets. Significant differences could also be seen in the frequency of keywords and the word trends in the collection of the tweets. Conclusion: These findings are significant in helping to automate the flagging of domestic-violence related tweets and alert the authorities so that they can take proactive steps such as assisting the victims in getting medical, police and legal help as needed. © 2023 Chua et al.

"Maternal mortality is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries compared to other parts of the world. International research efforts are reflective of the urgency to improve global maternal outcomes. The existing literature of maternal health interventions in low- and middle-income countries targets a variety of populations and intervention types. However, there is a notable lack of systemic reviews that examine the wider contextual and mechanistic factors that have contributed to the outcomes produced by interventions. This article aims to use realist synthesis design to identify and examine the relationships between the contexts, mechanisms and outcomes of maternal health interventions conducted in low- and middle-income countries. This will inform evidence-based practice for future maternal health interventions. In May 2022, we searched four electronic databases for systematic reviews of maternal health interventions in low- and middle-income countries published in the last 5 years. We used open and axial coding of contexts, mechanisms and outcomes to develop an explanatory framework for intervention effectiveness. After eligibility screening and full-text analysis, 44 papers were included. The majority of effective interventions reported good healthcare system contexts, especially the importance of infrastructural capacity to implement and sustain the intervention. Most intervention designs used increasing knowledge and awareness at an individual and healthcare-provider level to produce intended outcomes. The majority of outcomes reported related to uptake of healthcare services by women. All mechanism themes had a relationship with this outcome. Health system infrastructure must be considered in interventions to ensure effective implementation and sustainability. Healthcare-seeking behaviours are embedded within social and cultural norms, environmental conditions, family influences and provider attitudes. Therefore, effective engagement with communities and families is important to create new norms surrounding pregnancy and delivery. Future research should explore community mobilization and involvement to enable tailored interventions with optimal contextual fit. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The objective of this study was to determine the survival rate and the effects of different treatments on patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The study employed a systematic approach that included a search strategy across four databases: Embase, Web of Sciences, PubMed, and Scopus. The results obtained were screened initially by titles and abstracts, followed by full-texts in EndNote 8 software. The next stage involved data extraction and qualitative evaluation, where the Metan command was used to estimate the pooled survival rate. A total of 28 studies with a sample size of 63,796 were finally analyzed. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates (OS) for IBC patients were found to be 52% (95% CI; 46-58%, I2: 99.42%) and 61% (95% CI; 53-69%, I2: 93.63%), respectively. The 5-year OS rates in patients with non-metastatic and metastatic IBC were 59% (95% CI; 54-63%, I2: 98.31%) and 30% (95% CI; 26-35%, I2: 50.84%), respectively. The 5-year OS rate in non-metastatic patients who underwent BCS surgery was 60% (CI 95%; 26-94%, I2: 95.13%). The overall 5- and 3-year OS rates for patients with IBC were lower than those for all types of breast cancer, and the rates were even lower in patients with metastasis. Therefore, it is recommended that healthcare workers and women at risk should be vigilant of early symptoms of IBC to prevent metastasis by seeking medical attention on time. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 International License."
"The prevalence of online hate speech targeting the LGBTQ+ community poses a significant challenge in maintaining a safe and inclusive digital environment. This paper deals with the importance of addressing this issue by proposing methods for detecting this offensive messages towards this community population in Mexican Spanish. The study explores a considerable variety of approaches to solve the task with classical machine learning algorithms and with different approaches for feature extraction. Additionally, text preprocessing techniques specific to Twitter data, and word embeddings are employed to enhance the performance of the models. Through experimentation and comparative analysis, we assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying and classifying offensive messages. The findings of this research contribute to the development of robust tools for identifying and mitigating online hate speech, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and tolerant digital space for the LGBTQ+ community. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"In this paper, we present our system for the textual entailment identification task as a subtask of the SemEval-2023 Task 7: Multi-evidence Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Data. The entailment identification task aims to determine whether a medical statement affirms a valid entailment given a clinical trial premise or forms a contradiction with it. Since the task is inherently a text classification task, we propose a system that performs binary classification given a statement and its associated clinical trial. Our proposed system leverages a human-defined prompt to aggregate the information contained in the statement, section name, and clinical trials. Pre-trained language models are then finetuned on the prompted input sentences to learn to discriminate the inferential relation between the statement and clinical trial. To validate our system, we conduct extensive experiments with a wide variety of pre-trained language models. Our best system is built on DeBERTa-v3-large, which achieves an F1 score of 0.764 and secures the fifth rank in the official leaderboard. Further analysis indicates that leveraging our designed prompt is effective, and our model suffers from a low recall.

"This qualitative paper aimed to develop a model for early childhood teacher and caregiver [ECTC] preparation and development to enhance the desired qualities of young children. Two semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 60 (30 participants in each interview) including early childhood care and education [ECCE] experts, school administrators at ECCE level, early childhood teachers from both public and private sectors, caregivers, undergraduate students majoring in ECCE, and parents, followed by a focus group interview of 30 purposively selected participants and a public hearing with 35 participants. A four-step content analysis was conducted: (1) familiarizing the data; (2) splitting the text into meaning units and then condensing these meaning units; (3) developing codes; and (4) forming categories and themes (Erlingsson & Brysiewicz, 2017). Results suggested three components of the model: Quantitative and qualitative goals, mechanism and relevant agencies, and early childhood education and care [ECCE] program. The quantitative goal was the consistency between the number of graduates and future needs for ECTC, while the qualitative goal was the competencies of ECTC. Mechanisms conducted by the relevant agencies were different according to their roles. Three ECCE programs were established. The findings help improve understanding of early childhood teacher education, particularly in a developing country, and solve the current problems in caregiver and teacher preparation and development. © 2023 Kasetsart University."
"A contemporary European city faces various challenges, and it remains in a permanent state of crisis. The components that create such a situation are subject to change over time. In addition to the existing problems, the inhabitants, authorities, and people involved in designing and transforming the city, including architects, face new challenges. In recent years, the old problem of a shortage of affordable housing has been coupled with new challenges, including a sudden influx of refugees, climate change and its consequences, and the pandemic. Solutions to these issues are complex and multi-dimensional, and the actions to be taken are of interdisciplinary nature. Prefabricated architecture can be part of these solutions. Prefabricated building technologies, including prefabricated large-panel buildings, modular buildings and mobile structures, can, under appropriate conditions, modernize the process of building new housing. These solutions fit into the idea of sustainable development and can respond to unexpected and dynamically changing circumstances over time (emergency buildings). This paper examines the contemporary urban crisis and possible steps to be taken through the prism of the possibilities offered by the design of prefabricated buildings. The question is what criteria and design strategies should be adopted for prefabricated architecture to meet the demands of a city in crisis? The conducted analyses are universal. Nevertheless, they consider the application of prefabricated solutions in architecture in Poland and the potential for its further development. Therefore, the discussed implementations from the author’s country are given an important role in the text and are shown first against the background of European design practice. Omission of solutions from other continents is a deliberate delimitation. © 2023. Anna Tofiluk."
"This paper aims to apply sentiment analysis techniques to cope with the rapid growth of public opinion data. Due to the complexity of Chinese semantics and the sparsity and high-dimensionality of text data, sentiment analysis faces great challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on RoBERTa. The model uses the RoBERTa model to encode text into word vectors, and weights the word vectors with a weight matrix to enhance the emotional features in the sentence. Then, the contextual features of the word vectors are extracted by BiLSTM, and the hidden feature vectors are weighted by the attention mechanism, and finally classified by the fully connected layer. Experiments show that compared with the BERT model and other text classification models, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper is significantly improved in the three public data sets. © 2023 SPIE."

In particular, it examines the case of Girolamo Ascanio Molin (1736–1814), a politician, scholar and writer who, between the late 18th and early 19th century, built an extensive collection, whose physiognomy evolved according to the historical context, the frequentations of the senator, the opportunities provided by art markets and the self-representation strategies adopted by the patriciate in response to the New Regime. © 2023 Zalozba Z R C.

"The study is devoted to the actualization of the ideas of the great comparative scholar of the XIXth century Max Müller (1823–1900), a contemporary of A. Schleicher, who, as is traditionally believed, worked mainly in the naturalistic trend. The authors of the study show that the achievements of M. Müller were unreasonably underestimated, calling the scientist a popularizer of science. The victory of positivism in German linguistics weakened interest in the works by M. Müller: linguistics was no longer perceived as a natural science. It is noted that the positivist approach denied the “metaphysical” typology, close in spirit to M. Müller. The authors come to the conclusion that M. Müller’s ideas and methodological attitudes survived his time into the future and sound relevant in the humanities of the XXIst century, based on the anthropological understanding of linguistic phenomena. M. Müller was one of the first scholars to distinguish between philology and linguistics, he boldly extrapolated the attitudes of comparative studies to other areas of humanitarian knowledge — mythology, religion, innovatively applied a socio-cultural approach to the analysis of language features and the study of archaic texts. The study compares M. Müller’s ideas with traditional historical observations of national comparativist-and-historical observations of Russian comparativists — F.I. Buslaev and I.I. Sreznevsky. It is emphasized that his works reveal the connection of philosophy with private sciences: linguistics, theology, cultural history. In this sense, “The Science of Language” can be regarded as an original experience of creating philological hermeneutics. It is stated that M. Müller studied the historical space of language from the point of view relevant to the modern science of comparative semasiology. The refraction of his ideas is observed in the works of modern scientists — typologists, comparativists, conceptologists: V.A. Dybo, V.V. Ivanov, V.N. Toporov, Yu.S. Stepanov. Once again, the naturalistic approach is reaching a new level of development in the XXIst century, and the comparative method — the main research tool of M. Müller and other scientists of the Schleicher era — is being actualized not only in linguistics, but also in philology, history of religion and ethnology. The dialectical approach to typological linguistics applied by M. Müller, remains in demand by the science of modern times. © 2023, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. All rights reserved."
"This text addresses the touristification of the historical centres of Spanish cities. Two major cycles of recent touristification processes are identified: the first, from the 1990s to the 2008 crisis, and the second, from the crisis to the present day. The study of these two cycles is organised in two parts. Firstly, the main features of the cycle are identified with allusions to the current tourism situation based on data and information extracted from secondary sources. Secondly, an account is given of the main contributions in Geography made during this cycle, in the form of a state of the art at the time of the period. In contrast to a more conventional model, which separates the state of the art from the analysis of the phenomenon, we have preferred to present the dynamics of tourism and its approaches to study in an intertwined manner, thus highlighting the features of each cycle in terms of tourism and the city, but also its modes of study as far as Geography is concerned. Finally, conclusions ends by pointing out permanences and changes in the process of touristification and its interpretation in disciplinary terms and alludes to the situation of uncertainty generated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a challenging task that plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion, monitoring market trends, and assessing the impact of news on economic agents. In this shared task, we address targeted sentiment analysis in the financial domain, focusing on identifying the main economic target in news headlines and determining the sentiment polarity towards such targets. We propose a methodology that combines transformer-based models and phonestheme embeddings to extract meaningful features from the text, which are then used in a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for sentiment classification. Our approach shows promising results, outperforming the baseline with an F1-score of 0.529229 in Task 1. This research contributes to financial sentiment analysis by addressing the complexity of financial language and considering multiple economic agents' perspectives. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"This paper analyses the influence that the decisions made during the translation process may have on character representation in an audiovisual text. I will study the presence of discursive creation in the dubbing and subtitling into Spanish of two recently premiered German series (Sisi, in 2021, and Die Kaiserin, in 2022). They are based on the life of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria, and Queen Consort of Hungary. I will focus on the utterances of Ludovika of Bavaria, Elisabeth’s mother, when she speaks to her daughter or dialogs with her. The analysis will determine whether the presence of discursive creation, and the consideration of pragmatic factors and audiovisual translation constraints help to keep or change this character’s representation as it was originally portrayed in the German productions. © 2023 Universidad de Granada.

"Observing the challenges of the translation of legal texts in China, it is noteworthy that the source language, until the plethoric legislation under Dèng Xiǎopíng, was mainly German. The challenge eventually consisted in finding or ‘inventing’ adequate Chinese terms to render the German terms of art. Then the pendulum swung back. Chinese became the source language as Chinese statutes had to be translated into English. The challenge for the translators is a new and different one, because the English legal terms refer to the common law system (while Chinese law belongs to the Germanic legal family). What is for instance for a Chinese court the legal value of a translation which leads an existence beside the original text, e.g. of the English translation of a disposition of the Chinese Civil Code? A court is, generally speaking, only bound by an ‘authentic’ translation, – not by a simple official or by a private translation. Moreover, in the hypothesis that both language versions are authentic, the court has, in case of divergence between them, the obligation to reconcile the two versions. For a court – or an arbitrator, a legal counsel or a scholar – having to interpret and apply a particular disposition in a pending case, the added value of a translation is the following one. The interpretation which the translator himself gives of the text which he has to translate, can influence and facilitate their subsequent understanding, even in the case of a non-authentic translation. One could say that the text is ‘chewed’ already. The translation, if made timely, could also help the legislator to draft a final text which would be more clear and readable. For the drafter of an international treaty or of a commercial contract the same is true. The obvious negative aspect of a translation is that it can contain inconspicuous juridical errors and by consequence create confusion and misunderstanding by those who will have to apply the disposition. In the recent Chinese Civil Code some examples of such mistranslation can be given. In case of translation of a legal text of a non-common law jurisdiction a special warning about the danger of introducing in a surreptitious way foreign common law concepts in the target law system, is not superfluous. The process of translation of a legal text requires first an understanding of the precise legal meaning of it, and subsequently the conveying of that meaning in the target language in respect of the coherence of the concerned target law system. That last point precisely is the challenge. Two recommendations can in conclusion be made, one concerning the timing of starting the translation process, and another one concerning a desirable supervision by a comparative lawyer during the translation process. © 2023, Faculty of Modern Languages and Literatures, Adam Mickiewicz University.

"A key technical ingredient in the analysis of numerical approximations of PDEs with GRF inputs from function spaces, and of numerical methods for their efficient numerical treatment are constructions and numerical approximations of GRFs on real Hilbert and Banach spaces. Due to their high relevance in many areas of science (theoretical physics, quantum field theory, spatial and high-dimensional statistics, etc.), a rich theory has been developed in the past decades and a large body of literature is available now. We recapitulate basic definitions and key results, in particular on GMs, that are necessary for the ensuing developments. We do not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey. We require the exposition on GMs on real-valued Hilbert and Banach spaces, as most PDEs of interest are formulated for real-valued inputs and solutions. However, we crucially use in the ensuing sections of this text analytic continuation of parametric representations to the complex parameter domain. This is required in order to bring to bear complex variable methods for derivative-free, sharp bounds on Hermite expansion coefficients of GRFs. Therefore, we develop in our presentation solvability, well-posedness and regularity for the PDEs that are subject to GRF inputs in Hilbert and Banach spaces of complex-valued fields. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This article undertakes an analysis of four short stories by black Brazilian author Cristiane Sobral: “Cauterização” (2009) and three short stories published in the collection Pretos em contos – volume 2 (2021). Throughout the article, we cite portions of our 2019 interview with Sobral to illuminate her work and to present her as a model for processes of collaborative writing and action in the field of literature. In the stories, Sobral aims to promote a deeper appreciation of blackness in the minds of black and non-black readers, often through portrayals of internal and external crises the protagonists go through. These texts contain many attempts to reconfigure the minds of readers—to cultivate a black Brazilian consciousness in people of various racial identities. Sobral shows how this will benefit all of society, and not just black Brazilians. The article argues that, through her texts, Sobral intends to provoke in readers a crisis of conscience and identity capable of moving them to new understandings of themselves, of the world today, and of possible worlds. The article ends by commenting on the reception of Sobral’s works and her importance in the current literary movement, in efforts to legitimize black women and black women writers in modern-day Brazil. © 2023 Universidade de Brasilia.

"The fascinating world of Facebook commentary sections under the news portals are considered. There are headlines about politicians who can exercise power and about people that are rich and successful and could inspire awe. When we talk about the language of the politics we mostly consider and monitor the language of politician or language of the media/yellow press. However, there is a pool of reactions in the comment section where people sometimes anonymously, sometimes openly express their opinions on what we can call elites. Research method is based on discourse analysis of chosen Croatian media on Facebook in selected timeframe. The comment section is an interesting paradox of spoken language in written form. We can divide the users into few groups a) the supporters and fans; b) in opposition; c) those who are (trying to be) funny no matter the situation; d) drawing attention to the deprived to level the field e) asking “who cares” or “who are they anyway”. The main contribution of this text is a monitoring of the language/social place that is not explored that much especially when it comes to small language environment. The comment sections reflect not only language in use but also moods, wits, and problems of its users and it could be taken into consideration about how this part of society feels and talks about privileged. © 2023, International University Seminar for Balkan Studies and Specialization.

"Quality in simultaneous interpretation (SI) has always been an elusive concept, and the literature has usually argued that it is not easy to establish a valid instrument for the assessment of any interpretation assignment. The provision of accessibility services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing in live audiovisual subtitling, however, has routinely demanded quality assessment procedures of both the intralingual and interlingual live subtitles shown on the screen. In speech-to-text interpreting (STTI), which includes both intra- and interlingual respeaking (i.e. live subtitling without and with translation respectively), the NTR Model was proposed for the assessment of interlingual respeaking (Romero-Fresco & Pöchhacker, 2017). The purpose of this contribution is (i) to argue why the NTR Model might be conceptually valid for the assessment of SI, (ii) to present the results of a small-scale analysis of an SI task evaluated with four instruments aimed at scrutinizing the benefits of this Model and its applicability to SI, and (iii) to advocate for the use of objective assessment systems for student and professional performance in SI. © 2023 Universidad de Granada.

"Objective: Distraction osteogenesis is one of the treatment options in patients with severe maxillomandibular abnormalities to treat morphological and respiratory problems (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome). The study aimed to evaluate the effect of Le Fort I, II and III distraction osteogenesis (DO) on upper airway dimensions and respiratory function. Methods: Electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases. Studies that only involved two dimensional analyses were excluded. Besides, studies that performed DO in conjunction with orthognathic surgery were not considered. NIH quality assessment tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed to assess sleep apnea indices and the mean differences in the airway dimensions before and after DO. Gradings of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation were used to analyze the evidence level. Results: Among the 114 studies that went under full-text analyses, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results of the quantitative analyses showed that maxillary Le Fort III DO significantly increased the amounts of oropharyngeal, pharyngeal and upper airway volumes. However, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) showed a non-significant improvement after this procedure. Besides, the dimensions of the airways increased with Le Fort I and II DO, according to a qualitative analysis. Considering the design of the included studies, our results had a low level of evidence. Conclusion: Maxillary Le Fort DO does not significantly impact AHI, while it significantly increases the airway dimensions. Meanwhile, multicentric studies with standardized evaluation are still required to confirm the effects of maxillary Le Fort DO on airway obstruction. © 2023"
"We build a Sketch Engine corpus for Xenophon’s classical Greek scientific treatise On Horsemanship. Sketch Engine is a web-based corpus-analysis tool that allows the user to inspect the lexical makeup of a text (cf. keyword lists), explore the surroundings of select items (cf. concordances) and identify fixed expressions in a text (cf. n-grams). We make available our corpus-preparation tool and our corpus configuration file for Sketch Engine. We use the Sketch Engine corpus to detect discontinuous verbal multi-word expressions, specifically support-verb constructions (e.g. to take a decision). We examine how support-verb constructions – through their structural and lexical properties – aid discourse coherence and cohesion throughout Xenophon’s treatise. We furthermore examine how the recurring support-verb constructions in the treatise reflect the scientific register of the text. The article shows how an understudied category of lexico-syntactic device (support-verb constructions) in classical Greek majorly aids discourse cohesion, structurally and contextually speaking. It also shows how an understudied text in the form of a technical treatise (On Horsemanship) majorly furthers insight into scientific literacy of the classical period. Finally, by making available our corpus-preparation tool and code, we hope to further collaboration and adaptation and thus improvement of existing tools and counteract the multiplication of tools. © 2023, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

"This paper reports our algorithm for user profiling based on a non-linear low-dimensional representation of term distribution entropy applied to the PoliticES 2023 challenge. The proposed algorithm learns a 3D-dimensional model of text data that captures the important features for user profiling while can provide insightful information through cluster analysis and visualizations. The method uses a bag of words and weighting schemes based on the term's distribution entropy. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on the PoliticES 2023 dataset in its four user profiling subtasks: gender identification, profession identification, and binary and multiclass political ideology. The results show that our proposed solution achieved competitive results on all four sub-tasks. The proposed algorithm is also explainable, which means it can provide insights into why it makes certain predictions. This makes the proposed algorithm a valuable tool for user profiling, as it can be used to understand the factors influencing user behavior. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"This article is a conjointly formal and thematic inquiry dedicated to unpacking the internal coherence of Philip K. Dick’s A Scanner Darkly (1976). Organized around the unifying problem of pattern recognition, the article clarifies the deep congruence that exists between the seemingly unrelated imaginary technologies of the novel, used on both sides of the central demarcation that divides the identity of its protagonist: law enforcement and the trade in controlled substances. While it benefits from concepts designed to investigate science fiction as a genre, it also brings in discourses developed to make sense of media technologies in the real world. Guarding against the danger of eclipsing the text under information about the media historical context, this article allies media theory with narrative analysis and relies on “micrology” as a strategy of selective close reading following the logic of detection, recognition, and the failures thereof in the novel. This manner of inquiry allows me to specify the nature of pattern recognition as a lost capacity in the narrative arc, tracking the problems of information theory and the decline of cognitive capacities, as well as demonstrating their immanence to a single complex of ideas. In this sense, what belongs to intellectual history in the following discussion, is subject to the requirement that it makes the technological and psychological aspects of the narrative more intelligible and respond to the unique challenges of its combination of estranging world-building and all too familiar countercultural tropes. © 2023, Istanbul University Press.

"The paper analyzes the features of the transmission of gender-marked language structures in translation from English into Russian. The research object is the linguistic manifestation of gender-generic relations in the text of feature film scripts and their translation. The author describes the structure of scripts, which, in order to express the emotionality of the characters, must contain the relationship of events, descriptions of the environment, and brief notes. At the level of translation analysis, the author presents strategies, methods, and methods of translation, considering social and grammatical gender relations in the language. When translating, it is necessary to qualitatively convey the interpretation and understanding of the system and norms of the text of the source language, along with an explanation of its linguistic structures. The paper considers contemporary approaches to understanding the correlation between the semantic category of gender and the socio-cultural category of gender, which are especially significant in translation activities in the film industry. It should be noted that within the framework of the spread of globalization and the struggle for political influence between women and men, gender manifestations in the language in the context of socio-political discourse become the starting point for controversy. An appropriate understanding of the extralinguistic realities of the social and grammatical gender structures of the language will help the translator create an image that is as close as possible to the original and does not contradict the socio-cultural realities of the country of the target language. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This essay examines Georgi Plekhanov, founder of the Russian Marxist movement and a supposed exemplar of “vulgar Marxism.” It analyses Plekhanov's formulation of a Marxist aesthetic, interrogating the widespread image of Plekhanov's “vulgar” focus on economic determinism and his neglect of cultural forces' influence on revolutionary praxis, locating him instead within a fuller history of Marxist thought. A contextualization of Plekhanov's fin-de-siecle writings on art demonstrates that these texts were effectively a component of his contemporary polemics against critics of Marxist theory, and that within them he was pursuing his polemical agenda of criticizing Kantian philosophy and defending Marxist materialism. These dual aims manifested in Plekhanov's rejection of the Kantian notion of aesthetic disinterestedness and a stress on the formative role class conflict exerted on artistic creation, ultimately resulting in his formulation of an original aesthetic theory prescribing political commitment and thus mobilizing artworks towards revolutionary ends. © 2023 Association for Economic and Social Analysis."
"Background: This study aimed to articulate chronological characteristics of decisions made by Japanese women with breast cancer (BC) since their diagnosis. Methods: Open-ended questions were asked using an Internet-based cross-sectional survey method. Qualitative content analysis was performed on 1,158 free descriptive responses obtained from 549 participants, which were categorized according to the content of decisions. Furthermore, 994 text data from 433 respondents to the quantitative questions were categorized according to the decisions’ timing and examined in relation to medical and sociodemographic factors. Results: Whereas more than 60% of medical decisions, except chemotherapy, were made before initial treatment, approximately more than one-third of sociopsychological decisions were made only after the initial treatment. In decisions regarding medical care, only surgical decisions showed an association between timing and the participants’ decision-making style. Meanwhile, in decisions regarding sociopsychological matters, socioeconomic status at the time of diagnosis, such as marital and employment status, along with the perceived importance of what was to be determined, were associated with the timing of decision-making related to employment, attitudes toward life with BC, family matters and financial affairs. Conclusion: Women make various decisions depending on the amount of time since the diagnosis of BC. Generally, medical decisions are made prior to initial treatment, while these temporal characteristics are not observed for decisions relating to sociopsychological matters. Furthermore, socioeconomic status influences the timing of decision-making regarding sociopsychological matters. This finding can illustrate the manner in which to go through life with BC, and thus, help women who are unexpectedly diagnosed with BC to be more prepared. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 International License."
"Sentiment analysis has always been a hot research topic in the field of natural language processing. With the development of artificial intelligence and big data technology, many data such as text, images, and videos that have personal emotional tendencies are accidentally generated. Initially, researchers mainly focused on studying text data, but over time, more and more people began to realize the limitations of single-mode analysis. By introducing multi-modal data such as images and videos, more dimensional information can be provided for sentiment analysis, thereby improving performance. Therefore, more and more researchers are exploring richer sources of emotional information to improve the effectiveness of sentiment analysis. This article proposes a multi-modal sentiment analysis method based on deep learning and designs an experimental model targeted towards video modal data. In terms of text, this article proposes a GloVe-based BiGRU word vector model to process data. For images, the method changes from using simple frame extraction to speaker anchoring, uses object detection technology to segment the region of interest for the subsequent model to extract image expression features. A pre-trained ResNet101 model is used to obtain vectors and generate a sequenced image matrix, which is then input to LSTM for processing. From the experimental results, it can be seen that this method performs better than existing methods in terms of accuracy and F1 scores. © 2023 SPIE."
The proceedings contain 166 papers. The topics discussed include: effects of different mobility of electrons and holes in chains with different types of conductivity; the impact of organic production and organic certification on purchase intention based on machine learning and text analysis; improved object detectors based on semantic feature fusion; fast image interaction technology based on virtual reality; optimization of multimodal transportation path for fresh agricultural products considering unexpected factors and transfer frequency constraints; Lapa: multi-label-flipping adversarial attacks on graph neural networks; challenges and solutions for network security in the information age; research on parameter association design method of complex assembly; design and implementation of inventory management information system for resource-based enterprises; and a method of topology obfuscation based on adding virtual nodes and links.
"This study uses machine learning and text analysis methods to explore whether organic production and organic certification affect the purchase of organic products. Organic tea was selected as the research object and analyzed through the collection of online comment texts and questionnaire data. It is found that there were no significant differences between gender and age groups in the attention paid to organic tea production, organic certification, and organic tea quality. According to the binary metalogic regression and XGBoost algorithm of machine learning, the quality of organic tea is the most important factor affecting consumers' willingness to buy organic tea. In addition, the understanding of organic production and confidence in organic certification will affect the purchase behavior of organic tea. From the term frequency and semantic network, it can be found that consumers believe that organic tea is a durable, mellow, and high-quality product, which is worth promoting. © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: With the increase in the aging population, informal caregivers have become an essential pillar for the long-term care of older individuals. However, providing care can have a negative impact and increase the burden on caregivers, which is a cause for concern. Objective: This study aimed to comprehensively depict the concept of “informal caregiver burden” through bibliometric and content analyses. Methods: We searched the Web of Science (WoS) database to obtain bibliometric data and included only papers published between 2013 and 2022. We used content analysis to extract and identify the core concepts within the text systematically. Results: Altogether, 934 papers were included in the bibliometric analysis, from which we selected 19 highly impactful papers for content analysis. The results indicate that researchers have focused on exploring the factors that impact informal caregiver burden. Meanwhile, there has been a widespread discussion regarding the caregiver burden among those caring for recipients with specific illnesses, such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer, as these illnesses can contribute to varying levels of burden on informal caregivers. In addition, questionnaires and interviews emerged as the predominant methods for data collection in the realm of informal caregiver research. Furthermore, we identified 26 distinct assessment tools specifically tailored for evaluating burden, such as caregiver strain index (CSI). Conclusion: For future studies, we suggest considering the intersectionality of factors contributing to the burden on informal caregivers. This approach could enhance the well-being of both caregivers and older care recipients. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Following a three-year post-termination transition period to bring investor-state arbitration disputes, the investment protections afforded by Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) finally expired in June 2023. Chapter 11 was one of the most litigated, cited, commented, and copied investment treaties. An important, but largely ignored, part of its legacy is how the making of NAFTA Chapter 11 shaped its subsequent successful diffusion. Combining traditional legal assessment with computational text-as-data analysis, this article shows how the give and take during the negotiations generated buy-in on the part of Mexico and Canada and emulation by Latin American countries who helped to spread NAFTA Chapter 11 language globally. The link between the making and diffusion of NAFTA Chapter 11 highlights the power of negotiated compromise: sharing the pen with others may sometimes be the most effective way to write the rules that come to shape the world. © 2023 The Canadian Yearbook of International Law/Annuaire canadien de droit international."
"The BUAA team's participation in REST-MEX 2023 and focuses on their exploration of essential features that capture writing style, such as character n-grams, as well as thematic elements like word usage and word n-grams. The Rest-Mex competition encompasses various subtasks, including the identification of tourist attraction types, which involves a thematic perspective. The prediction of the review's country of origin includes significant writing style components that can unveil the specific variant of Spanish used. Lastly, polarity prediction hypothesizes a blend of thematic components or commonly used words to express positive or negative opinions about tourist attractions, while also considering the author's writing style, such as the empathic or friendly tone used to describe the services and amenities of each attraction. The objective was to analyze different stylistic features of the texts and determine the most informative set in order to improve the classification in the analysis of Spanish tourist texts using the SVM algorithm. To achieve this, stylistic and thematic attributes were explored and combined using a two-stage hyperparameter search strategy. with this approach, a sentiment track score of 0.72 was achieved, securing the 6th place out of 17 participating teams. It is important to highlight that this result is significant, considering the simplicity of the proposed solution and a method that requires few computational resources. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Research objectives: This paper aims to identify inaccuracies in the Russian translation by A.S. Kozin of paragraphs 270 and 275 of the Mongolian 13th-century historical text “The Secret History of the Mongols.” These inaccuracies hinder a proper understanding of the information presented. The paragraphs in the source text narrate events related to the organization and course of the Great Western campaign of the Mongols (1236–1242). The translations sometimes present information that contradicts other sources and, consequently, modern interpretations of the history of the 1236–1242 Campaign. Furthermore, the points noted are occasionally refuted by other information within the same source. The analysis of these excerpts, which are ambiguous in meaning, leads to the conclusion that mistakes were made in their Russian translation. Notably, the inaccuracies identified in A.S. Kozin’s translation have not been previously addressed by researchers. Errors in the translation of the source material hinder the accurate comprehension and interpretation of its content by Russian-speaking researchers, occasionally leading modern authors astray and potentially resulting in incorrect conclusions. Research materials: This study focuses on specific information in the Russian translation by A.S. Kozin of paragraphs 270 and 275 of the Mongolian historical text “The Secret History of the Mongols.” The investigation was conducted by comparing questionable segments with translations of the source text in other European languages, as well as with re-transcriptions of the text into Mongolian carried out by specialists. Results and novelty of the research: This paper exposes inaccuracies in A.S. Kozin’s Russian translation of “The Secret History of the Mongols” and proposes their correction. A thorough understanding of the source material is crucial for its accurate interpretation and drawing of correct conclusions. This study may be of particular interest to Russian-speaking researchers. © Фидаров Р.Ф., 2023."

"Introduction: There has been an unprecedented rise is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) amongst medical fields. Recently, a dialogue agent called ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has grown in popularity through its use of large language models (LLM) to clearly and precisely generate text on demand. However, the impact of AI on the creation of scientific articles is remains unknown. A retrospective study was carried out with the aim of answering the following questions: identify the presence of text generated by LLM before and after the increased usage of ChatGPT in articles submitted in OTSR; determine if the type of article, the year of submission, and the country of origin, influenced the proportion of text generated, at least in part by AI. Material and methods: A total of 390 English articles were submitted to OTSR in January, February and March 2022 (n = 204) and over the same months of 2023 (n = 186) were analyzed. All articles were analyzed using the ZeroGPT tool, which provides an assumed rate of AI use expressed as a percentage. A comparison of the average rate of AI use was carried out between the articles submitted in 2022 and 2023. This comparison was repeated keeping only the articles with the highest percentage of suspected AI use (greater than 10 and 20%). A secondary analysis was carried out to identify risk factors for AI use. Results: The average percentage of suspected LLM use in the entire cohort was 11% ± 6, with 160 articles (41.0%) having a suspected AI rate greater than 10% and 61 (15.6%) with an assumed AI rate greater than 20%. A comparison between articles submitted in 2022 and 2023 revealed a significant increase in the use of these tools after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 (9.4% in 2022 and 12.6% in 2023 [p = 0.004]). The number of articles with suspected AI rates of greater than 10 and 20% were significantly higher in 2023: >10%: 71 articles (34.8%) versus 89 articles (47.8%) (p = 0.008) and >20%: 21 articles (10.3%) versus 40 articles (21.5%) (p = 0.002). A risk factor analysis for LLLM use, demonstrated that authors of Asian geographic origin, and the submission year 2023 were associated with a higher rate of suspected AI use. An AI rate >20% was associated to Asian geographical origin with an odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.03–3.11) (p = 0.029), while the year of submission being 2023 had an odds ratio of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1–2.5) (p = 0.02). Conclusion: This study highlights a significant increase in the use of LLM in the writing of articles submitted to the OTSR journal after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5. The increasing use of these models raises questions about originality and plagiarism in scientific research. AI offers creative opportunities but also raises ethical and methodological challenges.

"In recent years, the use of metaphor in white papers has proliferated as it plays a significant role in cognitive processing. In order to shed light on the intricate relationship between humans and the natural environment, this study focuses on the analysis of metaphor usage in a particular white paper titled “China’s Green Development in the New Era” within the field of ecopolitics. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, namely the utilization of a self-built corpus and case studies, is employed to categorize the translation strategies of metaphors. The findings of this study demonstrate that the metaphors utilized in the white paper effectively capture elements of social cognition and ideology. Moreover, with the assistance of part-of-speech tagging tools, it is observed that most translated metaphors strive to maintain the salient features of the source text, aiming to achieve equivalence in both form and meaning. © 2023 Author(s)."
"The paper analyzes the metaphor of “an invisible hand”, which was introduced two and a half centuries ago by Adam Smith (1723—1790) and which eventually became the central concept of modern economics. Its first part presents a detailed textual analysis of three fragments from Smith’s works where it is discussed — in the posthumously published “The history of astronomy” (1796), “The theory of moral sentiments” (1757) and “The wealth of nations” (1776). A question arises what meaning Smith put into his metaphor and what significance he attached to it — was there some important general idea behind it or was it merely a passing rhetoric device? There is also no consensus among historians of economic thought what interpretation is more correct — theological (in this case, the “invisible hand” is attributed to the Divine Providence directing it) or secular (in this case, it acts autonomously, without control from any external powers). In addition to “an invisible hand”, we also find in Smith’s texts “the visible hand” of the state, and he leaves no doubt on whose side his sympathies are. © 2023, Vopr. Ekon. All rights reserved."
"This paper introduces a proposed solution for the classification of tourist text reviews. The problem was initially presented at Rest-Mex 2023: Research on Sentiment Analysis Task for Mexican Tourist Texts. The objective of this task is to determine the polarity (1 and 5), the type of opinion (hotel, restaurant, or attraction), and the country (Mexico, Cuba, Colombia) associated with a given set of reviews. Our approach is primarily based on the Mutual Information (MI) measure. During the training stage, our approach involves clustering each word from the provided training data according to their respective classes. Subsequently, we compute the MI value of each word within each class. Additionally, we generate synonyms for each word and incorporate them into a set, associating them with the same MI value as their respective word. This set of words, referred to as ""trained"" words, along with their normalized MI values, is utilized as class features. In the classification stage, when a new instance is provided, each word is compared with the ""trained"" words belonging to each class. The MI values of the intersected words are then summed. The predicted class is assigned based on the class with the highest sum value. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Mass media mediate different publics, thus being crucial in constructing political reality. By selecting which topics are cov-ered (agenda), which voices are heard, or how social and political issues/actors/dynamics are represented (priming and framing), mass media impacts how political conversations and processes unfold. Acknowledging the increasing mediatisa-tion of politics, this article zooms into media texts of the Portuguese media during a complex political period that included national elections to explore how populism as a term, label, or topic was used and/or co‐opted to create and negotiate political EU representations. Building on a historical perspective and using critical thematic analysis, this article argues that populism was used in the media and by the media as a discursive mechanism of political positionality and/or dele-gitimisation or criticism of political actors, agendas, or moves, thus making populism and the EU co‐constitutively used as embodying political antipodes and making the EU work as a discursive buffer concerning populism in the country. © 2023 by the author(s)."
"Metaverse is designed as a time and space-independent environment where virtual and reality will be intertwined, real-time and multi-user, human–computer–robot interactions will be possible. Metaverse design needs to be handled together with the internet, social networks, computer games, virtual reality glasses, augmented reality software, the internet of things, wearable devices, 5G/6G internet infrastructure, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, and robotics technologies. The Metaverse in design is a concept that covers every field, from education to art, from commerce to health, and from games to entertainment. Platforms, where many people of different languages, religions, races, and ages can interact simultaneously with avatars, AR/VR, smart devices, and wearables, have the potential to generate enormous amounts of data. The analysis of this produced data with advanced artificial intelligence techniques has critical importance in terms of both the ecosystem’s continuity and the user experience’s improvement. Artificial intelligence and robotic technologies act as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds in Metaverse platforms. To provide communication between human–avatar, avatar–avatar, human–robot, and robot–avatar, natural language recognition, voice recognition, voice-to-text conversion, and text-to-speech conversion tasks can be performed with artificial intelligence technologies. Metaverse platforms, where individuals in the real world can control their avatars or robots in the virtual world with various hardware, communicate with others, and produce rich digital content, also promise to make their economies. However, such a Metaverse ecosystem has not been created, as the necessary technology and infrastructure are not yet available. In addition, the hardware required for users to enter these Metaverse platforms is limited in number, quite expensive, cumbersome, and unsuitable for long-term use. For this reason, technology companies and social media giants are investing heavily to create their Metaverse ecosystems. Therefore, the future of the internet is shaped in parallel with the development of infrastructure and technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"OBJECTIVES: The distinction of benign lesions from malign tumors is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of miRNAs as plasma biomarkers for the discrimination of malign and benign breast tumors. METHODS: Whole blood samples obtained from 40 individuals in 3 groups designated as invasive ductal carcinoma group, fibroadenoma group and healthy controls were included in this study. The expression levels of 372 miRNAs were determined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The comparison of fibroadenoma group with healthy controls revealed an upregulation of thirty miRNAs and downregulation of twenty-nine miRNAs. The comparison of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) group with controls has shown that eight miRNAs were upregulated while eleven miRNAs were downregulated. When comparing IDC and fibroadenoma groups, 15 miRNAs were found to be upregulated, while 10 miRNAs were downregulated. Further analysis of these miRNAs aimed to determine their power in distinguishing IDCs from fibroadenomas. Among the miRNAs analyzed, seven miRNAs have shown sufficient discriminative power, of which three miRNAs, namely miR-637, miR-523-5p and miR-490-3p, have shown a significantly high discriminative power.

"Fibre-Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology is now being used in numerous fields for data collection from different physical phenomena, like pipeline monitoring, traffic monitoring on highways, monitoring the condition of track and train on railroads etc. One such field of application is the collection of geo-physical data, where it is used to collect seismic information. Vibrations are detected so that acoustic energy can be captured along the route of optical fibres. Thus, existing fibre optic cables can be readily utilized for the purpose of DAS, allowing data capture in real time. However, the data collected from DAS systems need to be analysed and processed with the help of advanced computer algorithms in order to gain important insights into the observed physical phenomena. Appropriate signal processing need to be applied to detect and extract different signatures, mostly vibrations due to various movements along the path of laid out optical fibre. In the present work, signal processing algorithm is presented for detection of such signatures, in line with keyword based algorithms applicable to text mining. The methodology is tested on available public domain data for studying an earthquake in Indonesia and results are presented. © 2023 IEEE."
"Sound studies in general, and voice studies in particular, present particular challenges for digital humanities scholarship. The software tools available to digital humanists who want to study performative speech are less familiar and less developed for our uses, and the user base is also much smaller than for text mining or network analysis. This article provides a critical narrative of our research and an outline of our methodology, in applying, developing and refining tools for the analysis of pitch and timing patterns in recorded performances of literary texts. The primary texts and audio considered are poetry readings, but the tools and methods can and have been applied more widely to podcasts, talking books, political speeches, etc. © 2023, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

"The study of opinions, sentiments, assessments, perspectives, and feelings as they are expressed in written language is the focus of sentiment analysis and evaluation mining. It is commonly the subject of text mining, information mining, and web mining because it is one of the most active study fields in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis has been applied in many different contexts, including the study of how events affect unofficial groups and the exploration of presumptions about goods and services. The importance of sentiment analysis is increasing at the same time as virtual entertainment such as surveys, group chats, web blogs, micro sites, Twitter, and interpersonal organizations. In this work, we provide the results of our preliminary studies on twitter sentiment analysis. This study seeks to distinguish subjects from sentiment in tweets. It recognizes the sentiment that refers to the particular problem using Natural Language Processing techniques. Our analysis consists of three main processes, subjective grouping, semantic affiliation, and extreme order, to characterize sentiment. By describing the syntactic relationship between sentiment dictionaries and subject, the study makes use of sentiment vocabularies. Exploratory results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs better than existing message sentiment analysis tools because tweets don't have the same architecture as traditional messages.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This paper analyses the story «Cirios rojos» by Segundo Serrano Poncela from a deconstructive perspective. Segundo Serrano Poncela wrote the story during his exile in Latin America and tells an event that occurred at the beginning of the military conflict of 1936. The story pits members of the two sides of the Spanish Civil War, a devout woman and a Republican man, against each other in a life-and-death struggle. Serrano Poncela presents an inside observation of the thoughts and feelings of his characters and brings out their different visions. The unforeseen confrontation of the two adversaries becomes a conflict between them; the devout woman wishes to expel the republican as her enemy; he is dependent on her help. The woman’s house becomes a battlefield for them, where one wants to save herself from the presence of the other, and the other wants to save his life. The text constructs a hierarchical opposition between the two; it elevates one and lowers the other, underlining the inherent characteristics of the two points of view. Focusing on significant points in the text, we try to show how the higher side of the hierarchy overthrows its own logical system, falling into contradictions between what it stands for and what it does. © 2023, Istanbul University Press.

"This article introduces to political science a framework to analyze the content of visual material through unsupervised and semi-supervised methods. It details the implementation of a tool from the computer vision field, the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW), for the definition and extraction of ""tokens""that allow researchers to build an Image-Visual Word Matrix which emulates the Document-Term matrix in text analysis. This reduction technique is the basis for several tools familiar to social scientists, such as topic models, that permit exploratory, and semi-supervised analysis of images. The framework has gains in transparency, interpretability, and inclusion of domain knowledge with respect to other deep learning techniques. I illustrate the scope of the BoVW by conducting a novel visual structural topic model which focuses substantively on the identification of visual frames from the pictures of the migrant caravan from Central America.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"Aim. Burnout syndrome in academicians of healthcare professions adversely aff ects their well-being and performance during work, and it is considered common worldwide. The aim of this systematic review was to identify burnout factors among medical faculty. Material and methods. Electronic searches were conducted in Citations and Abstracts for Literature of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) Plus with full text, MEDLINE with full text, Academic Search Complete, and PsycInfo following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After excluding duplicates and articles, which did not meet the inclusion criteria, 17 studies were included in the fi nal analysis. The Quality Index checklist developed by Downs & Black was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. There are no randomized controlled trials in our area of interest, and non-randomized studies scored low. Results. A total of 17 studies (7,056 participants) across six countries were compatible with the inclusion criteria. Main associated factors of burnout included socio-demographic and work-related characteristics; physician factors (age, gender minority status, disability, desire to reduce the workload) and workplace culture; demographic factors, including sex, ethnicity/race, years of experience, specialty, and work-related factors; lack of institutional factors, such as mentorship, collaboration opportunities, feelings of empowerment, value, and support of well-being; poor faculty relationships and professional behaviors; perceived stressors, spousal/ partner support, self-efficacy, and depression; long working hours, interpersonal interactions among the colleagues, family and social factors, including challenges related specifically to women, feelings and emotions, and personal qualities; high workload, limited time off, nature of work (high stake job), stigma/culture around burnout, administrative burden, lack of autonomy, and frequent performance feedback; high schedule misalignment; inadequate professional fulfillment, culture of wellness, personal reliance, and efficiency of practice; lack of organizational justice and job satisfaction; and anxiety-depression levels. Conclusions. There was a considerable prevalence of burnout among medical faculty, which can be debilitating. Burnout among medical faculty remains the greatest threat to institutional growth and success.  © 2023 Maryam Alvandi et al., published by Sciendo."
"This paper offers a multilingual perspective from the point of view of affective jurilinguistics on the link between the concepts of justice and play through media and literary discourses. The emotional impact of social norms on the members of any social group is highlighted, while individual and collective identity is built by playing. Playing is construed as a socializing activity per se, be it under an explicit or hidden form. Homo ludens is, by definition, a homo juridicus, too, as he complies with the rules of the social games which characterize life in a community. Researchers in the field of affective neurosciences have demonstrated that our perception of the world is first and foremost affective. The rational construction of concepts and discourse follows affective perception and is rooted in it. In the field of justice, this means that a person needs to feel safe within the group they belong to and make sure that their life and the group’s will go on. Perception is the result of a permanent social contract which is renewed regularly and cathartically through arts. Alain Supiot stated that man is a metaphysical animal, adding that “the life of the senses in a human being is intertwined with the meaning of life” (Supiot, 2005: 7). By perceiving the world through his senses, the human being must bond with the other human beings, being thrown to the others through words. Thus, “the bond of the Law and the bonds of the words are intertwined in order to introduce every newborn baby to humanity, that is to give meaning to their life, in the double sense, general and juridical, of this word” (Supiot, 2005: 8). Affective jurilinguistics appears to be a privileged area of multidisciplinary research in pragmatics, discourse analysis, history of mentalities and neurosciences, as well as a useful instrument for the observation of language and discourse phenomena within legal texts and texts which are related to the field of law and justice (journalistic and literary texts, etc.). © 2023, Faculty of Modern Languages and Literatures, Adam Mickiewicz University.

"As an academic endeavor in an EFL setting especially in the field of reading comprehension, this study intended to examine intercultural communicative competence (ICC) and the effects of cultural familiarity on reading comprehension based on two specific ethnicities (Turk and Fars). To this end, participants, 130 EFL students majoring in English, were chosen from three universities in Iran. The effects of cultural familiarity on students’ reading comprehension were examined by utilizing two types of processes, providing relevant background knowledge and text nativization. These two processes were used as two separate treatments for the members of the experimental groups. Members of both control and experimental groups subsequently received reading comprehension tests. Then, to elicit ICC levels, the participants were asked to complete ICC Questionnaire. The statistical analysis of the data revealed the significantly positive effect of cultural familiarity on the reading comprehension performance of both Turk and Fars experimental groups and no significant difference was observed between the reading comprehension performance and ICC level of the ethnic groups of Fars and Turks. The present study emphasizes the facilitating and positive effect of cultural familiarity on the reading comprehension of specific ethnic groups and suggests that cultural familiarity can be a valuable tool for enhancing reading comprehension and promoting language performance and cultural competence of Iranian EFL learners. Therefore, due to the importance of teaching culture in the field of English language teaching, there should be much more attention to cultural and intercultural matters when designing a language curriculum. © 2023 Author(s)."
"This paper is a case-driven contribution to the discussion on the method-theory relationship in practices within the field of Computational Literary Studies (CLS). Progress in this field dedicated to the computational analysis of literary texts has long revolved around the new, digital tools: tools, as computational devices for analysis, have had here a comparatively strong status as research entities of their own, while their ontological status has remained unclear to the day. As a rule, they have widely been imported from the fields of data science and NLP, while less often being hand-tailored to specific tasks within interdisciplinary settings. Although studies within CLS are evolving to both a higher degree of specialization in method (going beyond the limitations of out-of-the-box tools) and a stronger theoretical modeling, the technological dimension remains a defining factor. An unreflective adoption of technology in the shape of tools can compromise the plausibility and the reproducibility of the results produced using these tools. Our paper presents a multi-faceted intervention to the discussion around tools, methods, and the research questions that are answered with them. It presents research perspectives first conceived at the ADHO SIG-DLS workshop Anatomy of tools: A closer look at textual DH methodologies that took place in Utrecht in July 2019. At that event, the authors discussed selected case studies to address tool criticism from several angles. Our goal was to leverage a tool-critical perspective, in order to “take stock, reflect upon and critically comment upon our own practices” within CLS. We identified Textométrie, Stylometry, and Semantic Text Mining as three central types of hands-on CLS. For each of these sub-fields, we asked: What are our tools and methods-in-use? What are the implications of using a tool-oriented perspective as opposed to a methodology-oriented one? How do either relate to research questions and theory? These questions were explored by case-studies on an exemplary basis. The unifying perspective of this paper is an applied tool criticism – a critical inquiry leveraged towards crucial dimensions of CLS practices. Here we re-compose the original oral papers and add entirely new sections to it, to create a useful overview of the issue through a combination of perspectives. While we elaborated the thematic connections between the individual case studies, we hope the interactive spirit of an exemplary exchange remains palpable: individual research perspectives shape the case studies reported for Textométrie, Stylometry and Semantic Text Mining, are complemented by further studies showcasing CLS-specific perspectives on replicability and domain-specific research, and a short section discussing a tool inventory as a practical, community-based incarnation of tool criticism. © 2023, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

"WebNir (https://webnir.eu) [1] is an open-access web platform that exposes several applications related to the assessment of risk from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) are made available. This platform is developed by the 'Nello Carrara' Applied Physics Institute of the National Research Council (IFAC-CNR) within the framework of a research project financed by INAIL (Italian Workers Compensation Authority). This paper describes the application that allows the automated processing of measurements produced by various instrumental chains operating in the time or frequency domain. The goal of these automated procedures is to perform the verification of compliance with exposure values, the calculation of various radiological protection indices and the graphical display of the source data and processing results. Initially, the procedure refers to the most common measuring instruments, implementing specific scanning algorithms for each. Then, this approach was extended to accept more generical measurement results, potentially produced by any measurement chain, as long as they are in open format (text file or spreadsheet). In particular, for data files whose structure is unknown to the system, the user provides the import procedure with the parameters necessary for its correct interpretation. The application also allows the calculation and representation of quantities not made available by the considered measurement chain (e.g., exposure indices, Δ B /3s variation). © 2023 International Union of Radio Science."
"This text is a political analysis of the events surrounding the demise of the Austro–Hungarian administration in Transylvania and its replacement by the Romanian one at the end of World War I. It focuses on the months of November and December 1918. In particular, the text looks at the Romanian paramilitary groups called the National Guards. I argue that in Transylvania in November and December 1918, the National Guards played a pacifying and state-building role, through their repressive and anti-communist function. Unlike the paramilitary phenomenon in the rest of Europe, in Transylvania it was the very counter-revolutionary function of the paramilitary troops that produced constructive and constitutive effects. At the same time, unlike the Romanian historiography, which almost unanimously has seen the role of these troops as only a positive one, I underline the repressive function of the National Guards, which made them act violently against any alternative political projects of that period in the region. The revolutionary state of the province in those days had to be calmed down for Transylvania’s autonomy to be ensured under the control of the local Romanian authorities. The Romanian elite’s state-building project needed security to gain legitimacy. To this end, this elite took control of the various paramilitary forces of the region and monopolized them under the National Guards umbrella. These groups were crucial in the repression against the republican movement and the perceived Bolshevik threat. © 2023 Sage Publications."
"The article presents the participation of the Javier Alonso-Mencía team in the REST-MEX@IberLef 2023 text clustering competition. The solution proposed by the Javier Alonso-Mencía team is based on clustering with K-means and Gaussian Mixture using representations of texts obtained through Sentence Transformer (multilingual). Prior to the clustering, several transformations are applied, including the elimination of stopwords and punctuation, as well as lemmatization of words. After obtaining vectors from the Sentence Transformer, dimensionality reduction is performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The best clusters, along with the selection of certain hyperparameters, was determined through visual analysis of the groups in a two-dimensional UMAP plane. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Purpose: Equitable inclusion of racial and ethnic participation in clinical trials is crucial to improving disparities in health care, especially for historically marginalized populations. Our study aims to describe the racial and ethnic demographics of patients enrolled in published phase 2 clinical trials involving proton therapy in the United States. Materials and Methods: Published manuscripts were identified in PubMed, Embase, World of Science, and Cochrane. Phase 2 trials evaluating proton therapy for US patients were included. For each article in the study, data were collected comprising authors, title, and publication year, and clinical trial numbers were verified. Additional data included tumor site, primary institution, sample size, reported race/ethnicity, and raw number/percentile of race/ethnicity. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Results: Overall, 970 titles were identified; 636 remained after duplicate screening, and 75 full-text articles were assessed. We identified 38 eligible manuscripts for inclusion comprising 2648 patients. Only 15 (39%) of the publications reported race/ethnicity. Of these, 8 (21%) and 10 (26%) documented Hispanic or Black trial participants, respectively; however, only 6 (16%) documented trial participation for both Hispanic and Black patients. Of the 1409 patients with a documented race/ethnicity, 89.0% (n = 1254) were non-Hispanic white, 5.3% (n = 75) were Black, and 2.2% (n = 31) were Hispanic. Other and unknown race/ethnicity comprised the remaining patients (3.5%; n = 49). Conclusion: We identified underreporting of demographic data in published phase 2 proton therapy trials, which unfortunately mirrored underreporting for cancer drug clinical trials. We also noted dramatic Black and Hispanic patient underrepresentation across the trials in which race and ethnicity are reported. Findings highlight the urgent need to identify and address barriers to proton therapy trials for Black and Hispanic patients ensuring clinical trials in radiation oncology are representative of the patients seen in clinical practice.

"Sentiment analysis in tourist texts has gained relevance in the last decade because tourism is a social, cultural, and economic phenomenon that contributes to the economic development of countries. Thus, there is a need to create new natural language processing (NLP) mechanisms that improve tourism services and meet tourist needs. For this reason, LKE-IIMAS team participated in the sentiment analysis task of Rest-Mex 2023, which has three sub-tasks: identifying polarity, type, and country on a given opinion. For solving both sub-tasks, we first generated several training sets using stratified sampling on the training set of this shared task. Then, we applied a back-translation method as a data augmentation technique to tackle the data imbalance in the polarity sub-task. Furthermore, We used a masked language model based on RoBERTa that had been trained with a large Spanish dataset to generate three training strategies. Our first strategy was to fine-tune the base model for text classification. The second strategy was to adapt the base model to the tourism domain and to fine-tune the model adapted to text classification. The third strategy was to fine-tune the model adapted with the data augmented. Finally, our team LKE-IIMAS achieved first in the ranking on the sentiment analysis task at Rest-Mex 2023. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"The objective of this text is to offer a classification of the ethical visions in circulation in the current debate capable of identifying which of them are compatible or not with the concept and institutions of the democratic rule of law. The text starts from the analysis of some thought models present in animalist, feminist and decolonial ethical visions to identify problems of compatibility and problems of caricature, that is, which of these visions develop tensions and incompatibilities with or offer caricatured visions of the democratic rule of law. Based on these reflections, the text proposes a distinction between ethics of identity and ethics of coexistence and outlines the general lines of a multinormative institutional model that allows both to coexist democratically in the same political community. © 2023 Departamento de Literatura EspaÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ola-Universidad de Sevilla.

"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to identify the infl uence of factors that determine the refusal of infl uenza vaccine among three subjects groups. METHODS: A survey was conducted amongst three high-risk groups in years 2018–2019 (Moscow, Russia). The survey involved 1,620 parents and pregnant women (group 1), 324 doctors (group 2) and 433 students (group 3). The analysis revealed a poor vaccine uptake among respondents of all three groups. RESULTS: According to the survey results, only 22.2 % of children and 13.8 % of adults were vaccinated against infl uenza. The group 2 showed higher rates for vaccinated adults and children, namely 36.7 % and 58.7 %, respectively. The lowest adherence to annual vaccinations was recorded in group 3 (only 17.3 %). There is also a negative correlation between adherence to vaccination and smoking –0.66), unhealthy diet –0.73), poor oral hygiene –0.61) as well as insuffi cient awareness of the need of infl uenza vaccine –0.81). CONCLUSION: The general lack of vaccination awareness has a fundamental role in forming a negative attitude toward infl uenza vaccine. It is necessary to conduct research to promote vaccination against infl uenza to improve vaccine uptake among high-risk groups, particularly in students (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 32).

"This research study presents a comparative analysis of multiclass classifiers for detecting irony and sarcasm in short texts. With the increasing use of social media, it has become important to develop accurate and efficient algorithms for detecting irony and sarcasm, which are often expressed implicitly in text. This study has evaluated five multiclass classifiers, including Naive Bayes, linear classifier, XG Boost, KNN, and SGD, using different text representations, such as count vectors, word-level TF-IDF, and hash vectors. The results showed that the linear classifier using word-level TF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of 74.39%, while the KNN classifier using hash vectors achieved the highest accuracy of 75.16%. However, all classifiers exhibited sensitivity to certain keywords and phrases, indicating the need for further research to improve the robustness of the classifiers. This study provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different multiclass classification approaches for detecting irony and sarcasm in short texts, which can guide future research in this field.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Introduction: The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) has been used for over 30 years to assess exercise capacity in patients with respiratory disease, and more recently, in those with heart failure. However, despite being a simple and reproducible test of real-world exercise capacity, its use in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) is less well accepted. We sought to review systematically the evidence surrounding the 6MWT in IHD. Methods: We searched the Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases for the following key terms: “six minute walk test/6 minute walk test/6MWT” and “angina/coronary artery disease/coronary disease/IHD/ischemic heart disease.” We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to select publications for full-text review and analyzed the collated data. Results: A total of 1228 unique papers were found, of which 71 were chosen for full-text review and 37 for detailed analysis. Most (23) concerned the effect on 6MWT distance (6MWTd) of cardiac rehabilitation, with measurements commenced after an intervention (acute myocardial infarction, n = 4; open heart surgery (OHS), n = 5; percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), n = 3; or other, n = 11). The effect on 6MWTd of OHS was investigated in 6 studies and of PCI in one study. The 6MWT is a useful measurement of physical capacity; data are limited on its ability to assess benefit following PCI. Conclusions: The 6MWT has been studied inconsistently in IHD. The majority of data are on patients before and after CR. Data are limited concerning the effect on 6MWTd of OHS or PCI. The available data support the 6MWT as a measure of change in performance status following coronary intervention. More work is required to confirm this hypothesis. © 2023 The Authors"
"Semantic Web is the vision to make Internet data machine-readable to achieve information retrieval with higher granularity and personalisation. Semantic annotation is the process that binds machine-understandable descriptions into Web resources such as text and images. Hence, the success of Semantic Web depends on the wide availability of semantically annotated Web resources. However, there remains a huge amount of unannotated Web resources due to the limited annotation capability available. In order to address this, machine learning approaches have been used to improve the automation process. This Systematic Review aims to summarise the existing state-of-the-art literature to answer five Research Questions focusing on machine learning driven semantic annotation automation. The analysis of 40 selected primary studies reveals that the use of unitary and combination of machine learning algorithms are both the current directions. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most-used algorithm, and supervised learning is the predominant machine learning type. Both semi-automated and fully automated annotation are almost nearly achieved. Meanwhile, text is the most annotated Web resource; and the availability of third-party annotation tools is in-line with this. While Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Accuracy are the most deployed quality metrics, not all the studies measured the quality of the annotated results. In the future, standardising quality measures is the direction for research. © 2023, Brno University of Technology. All rights reserved."

This study exploits evidence from the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion (ACA Medicaid) to examine the effects on the mental wellbeing of informal caregivers. Drawing on an event study and a Difference-in-Differences (DID) design we investigate the policy impact of ACA Medicaid using longitudinal evidence (from the Health and Retirement Study, HRS) for low-income individuals aged 64 or below. We find that ACA’s Medicaid reduced depressive symptoms among spousal caregivers, and specifically we estimate that exposure to ACA Medicaid gives rise to 8.2% points (on average, equivalent to 30% decrease) reduction in the feeling of depression and 8.7% points increase in the feeling of happiness (on average, 11% increase). The estimates are robust to various specifications, and we identify several potential driving mechanisms for the findings: reductions in out of -pocket expenses and labor supply and, as expected, increased after Medicaid uptake. The evidence from falsification tests confirms that the estimated effects are likely due to ACA’s Medicaid.

These activities not only help protect the health and wellbeing of care receivers but also reduce burden associated with the formal health and care systems in the US. This perhaps comes at the cost of degradation of caregivers’ personal health and wellbeing. This cost to caregivers has spillover effects on their social and profession lives. It affects the work-life balance of individuals due to their caregiving obligations.

"Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the human–nature interactions research landscape can benefit researchers by providing insights into the most relevant topics, popular research areas and the distribution of topics across different disciplines, journals and regions. The research literature on direct human–nature interactions is constituted from a rich and diverse spectrum of disciplines. This multidisciplinary structure poses challenges in keeping up with developments and trends. We conducted a multidisciplinary text-analysis review of research on direct, sensory human–nature interactions to understand the main topics of research, the types of interactions, the disciplines within which they manifest in the literature, their growth through time and their global localities and contexts. Our analysis of 2773 articles showed that there has been recent growth in research interest in positive human–nature interactions that is biased towards high-income countries. There is a substantial body of research on negative human–nature interactions, mostly from the medical fields, which is distinct from research on positive human–nature interactions in other fields such as ecology, psychology, social science, environmental management and tourism. Of particular note is the very large amount of medical research on the causes and consequences of snake bites, particularly in Asia. Understanding the relationship between these two contrasting types of interactions is of significant practical importance. More recent attention towards positive human–nature interactions in high-income societies biases views of the relationship between people and nature. Research into human–nature interactions needs to take the next step towards a unified and holistic understanding of the benefits and costs of direct experiences with nature. This step is crucial to achieve a more sustainable future that benefits both biodiversity and human society, during great environmental and climatic change.

"A formal Gender Dysphoria classification— as outlined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders— is a prerequisite for the reimbursement of both gender-affirming medical care and transgender mental health care in the Netherlands. Gender Dysphoria and its conceptual precursors have always been moving targets: moving due to research, policy, care practices and activism both within and outside of medicine. This raises the question of what Gender Dysphoria is exactly. To elucidate this question, we turn to the people who use the concept in clinical practice to come to a diagnosis and treatment indication: mental health professionals working in gender-affirming medical care and transgender mental health care. Using a material semiotics approach, we reflect upon how Gender Dysphoria is done in clinical practice. Based on an analysis of seventeen practice-based interviews with clinicians as well as an examination of clinical guidelines and texts, we describe four modes in which Gender Dysphoria is ordered. These modes of ordering illustrate that Gender Dysphoria is not one, but multiple. We illustrate how in the mode of isolating, Gender Dysphoria is something which is carefully isolated from mental disorders, while in the modes doing the future and narrating, Gender Dysphoria is done as a continuous and predictable object of care. Such orderings of Gender Dysphoria potentially conflict with a fourth mode of ordering: the doing of diversity in transgender health care. The study’s findings provide empirical insights into how transgender health care is currently done in The Netherlands and provide a foundation on which ethical debates on what good transgender health care should entail. © 2023 The Authors.

"This paper introduces the LyS A Coruña proposal for the Guarani-Spanish Code Switching Analysis task at IberLEF2023. The shared task proposes to analyze Guarani-Spanish code-switched texts, focusing on language identification, named entity recognition (NER), and a novel classification task for Spanish spans in a code-switched Guarani-Spanish context. We propose three multi-task learning systems that have common encoders based on two language models and different decoders in a multi-task learning setup. The encoders use the contextual embeddings by: (i) a large language model (LLM) pretrained on bidirectional machine translation on 200 languages (including Spanish and Guarani) from the No Language Left Behind project, and (ii) a BERT-based model pretrained in Spanish and finetuned in around 800k Guarani tokens. The decoders are: (i) a softmax output layer for Task 1, and (ii) conditional random fields (CRF) output layers for Tasks 2 and 3. According to official results, we ranked third in the three tasks. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Darwin’s theory of evolution, which is based on variation, heredity, and selection, includes all biological fields and spreads to other areas such as philosophy. Medicine is an example of how the evolutionary perspective can greatly improve the understanding of concepts in an area, as human health and pathological conditions are under the effect of evolution. Evolutionary medicine is an emerging paradigm for understanding human heterogeneity, health, and diseases. Nevertheless, there are indications that medical research and practice are only marginally affected by these ideas. Here, we investigate how concepts of biological evolution are employed in medical research. We use a bibliometric approach to look for the presence and frequency of biological evolution-related concepts in medical articles. The distribution of these concepts over the years is analyzed according to the medical specialty and the impact of the journal. Our data showed that: i) only a small percentage of articles in medical journals have an evolutionary perspective; ii) medical journals where these evolution-based articles are published focus on basic science, theoretical medicine, and less frequently, on applied medicine; iii) these articles are mostly from the microbiology, immunology, neurology, psychology, behavior, and oncology fields; and iv) viruses are the most frequently covered microorganisms, followed by bacteria, fungi, and protozoans. The collection of our results, considering the importance of evolutionary medicine in the medical field, highlights the need for a decisive change in perspective in medical research. © 2023, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

"Data integration represents a challenge in application development. Although there are several alternatives to data integration, such as federated and distributed databases, there are still problems with the standardisation of distinct data sources, and this happens because different companies develop distinct systems with different paradigms and concepts. In this paper, we present a case study, in the agriculture and environment domain, of an essential point in the data integration domain which is to show resources to identify nearby attributes concerning the characteristics of the content foreseen in the requirements presented in the proposed schema. Information technology experts in agribusiness help map the most relevant attributes for the investigated scenario. In our experimental tests, we used a quantitative method data analysis approach to validate the results with quantitative comparisons regarding the percentages of proximity between the attribute contents in the databases. Our proposal presents an alternative to simplify data integration without intermediate application or middleware layers. The results were measured on a scale between 0% and 100% to identify candidate attributes. The results were good in identifying attributes in the databases in almost 67% of the cases. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved."

"In the field of stock price forecasting, we are actively seeking to integrate various information to more accurately grasp market dynamics. Although historical stock prices and financial news have been widely used in previous studies, it is relatively rare to find research considering news-based, technical, and chip factors simultaneously and evaluating their combined effect. In this study, we innovatively propose a multi-kernel model that not only combines news-based, technical, and chip factor analysis but also utilizes market data provided by the Taiwan Stock Exchange, including institutional trading situations and stock price technical indicators. The aim is to further enhance the prediction accuracy of stock price dynamics. Based on the frequency of word occurrences, we design a new discriminant index to extract features highly correlated with stock prices from financial news. The empirical results show that our multi-kernel model significantly surpasses the single-kernel model in prediction accuracy. However, we also find that although financial news is somewhat correlated with stock price dynamics, information such as chip factors and stock price technical indicators contribute more significantly in our model. This further validates that our multi-kernel learning algorithm can effectively handle multifaceted data sources and give appropriate weights according to the importance of each data point, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness of prediction. Through this research, we hope to bring new perspectives and inspirations to the field of stock price forecasting. © 2023 The Authors"
"According to the classification of speech strategies by O.S. Issers, semantic, lexico-grammatical, and pragmatic indicators act as linguistic indicators of speech strategies. The article is devoted to the analysis of the most significant linguistic and extralinguistic aspects of speech strategies that are used to create the image of the President of Egypt Abdel Fattah Khalil El-Sisi in the movie series “٣ ” (The Choice 3). These strategies were considered as part of the analysis of the Arabic polycode text, which is presented as the integrity of verbal and non-verbal components. The material of the study was the communicative acts of the main characters and the video sequence of the analyzed series, in which the authors recreated the revolutionary era of Egypt in 2013. The novelty of the study is an attempt to characterize Arabic political discourse as an independent linguistic phenomenon. As a result of the study, the authors arrive at the conclusion that the creation of the image of a politician requires such semantic indicators of speech strategy as: submission, threat, discrediting; lexico-grammatical indicators: syntactic synonyms of various types, paremiae, dialectal forms. The effect of applying these communication strategies, which create the image of the Egyptian president, is enhanced by extralinguistic parameters and symbols studied within the theory of the polycode text. The analysis of the interaction of codes of various genres of the polycode text in the Arabic political discourse is of interest for further research. © Dugalich N.M., Shavtikova А.Т., Izildin Okil, 2023."

"Background: Despite the widespread use of ultra-massive transfusion (UMT) as an intervention for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock, no standard definition exists. We performed a systematic review to determine a consensus definition for UMT. Methods: A search was performed from 1979 to 2022. The authors screened studies defining UMT and associated outcomes as defined by our prespecified PICO questions. The PRISMA guidelines were used. Results: 1662 articles met criteria for eligibility assessment, 17 for full-text review and eight for data extraction. Only two studies demonstrated a consensus definition of UMT, which used ≥20 units of red blood cell product within 24hrs. Parameters associated with increased mortality included lower blood pressure, lower pulse and lower Glasgow Coma Score at the time of presentation and a higher injury severity score and undergoing a resuscitative thoracotomy. Conclusions: The absence of a consensus definition for UMT raises challenges from clinical, research and ethical perspectives. Based on our findings, the authors advocate for the feasibility of standardizing the definition of UMT as ≥20 units of red blood cell product within 24hrs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. As such, an unmet need exists in the primary and secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (CVEs). Specifically, identifying drugs that can reduce the progression of CVD and serious adverse events is much needed. Drugs that work by reducing platelet aggregation, blocking cholesterol formation (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors), and/or blocking inflammation pathways (mainly interleukin-1b [IL-1b]) have been linked to preventing adverse CVEs, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), statins, colchicine, and IL-1 inhibitors (interleukin-1 receptor antagonists). This systematic review aims to provide insight into utilizing these four agents for the primary and/or secondary prevention of CVD. In this systematic review, we opted to review the efficacy of aspirin, statins, colchicine, and IL-1 inhibitors in the primary and secondary prevention of CVE to provide clinical practitioners with evidence-based practice approaches and determine any unmet needs in their utilization. Between October 1 and 12, 2021, a search was conducted and completed on five databases: PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Biomedical Reference Collection: Comprehensive. A total of 13 researchers (V.A., A.H., S.B., V.G., D.C., C.C., C.B., C.A., S.K., J.H., A.K., S.F., and S.E.) were involved in the search and screening of the articles. Search terms included ""aspirin, statins, colchicine, IL-1 inhibitors, and primary, secondary, myocardial infarction (MI).""Inclusion criteria included clinical study design, English language articles, all genders older than 50 years old, and established patient history of CVD, including MI. In addition, articles were excluded if they were animal models, in vitro studies, pharmacokinetic studies, systematic reviews, literature reviews, and studies exploring therapies other than those listed in the inclusion criteria. First, five individuals independently sorted through abstracts or articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, a team of 13 individuals sorted through full-text articles of selected abstracts based on the same criteria. A separate researcher resolved conflicts between the team. A total of 725 articles were identified from all databases, from which 256 duplicated articles were removed. Thus, a total of 469 articles abstracts were screened, of which 425 articles either did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the exclusion criteria. A total of 42 articles were retrieved and assessed for full-text review, from which 15 articles were retrieved for analysis. Statins may prevent primary CVEs based on their role in preventing cholesterol formation. Aspirin, canakinumab, and colchicine may be helpful in the secondary prevention of CVEs due to their blocking of various steps in the inflammation pathway leading to CVD. Future research should primarily focus on the use of canakinumab and colchicine in preventing CVD due to the limited number of studies on these drugs.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."
"Song discourse, as a type of discourse, represents a special field research. A piece of music related to a certain historical context is part of the expression of culture, memory and identity of the nation. The aim of the study is the interpretation of song and poetry works from the period of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), one of the difficult stages in the history of the country, as well as a semiotic analysis of the song texts of the two fighting parties. The analysis of the lyrics makes it possible to determine the key features of the depiction of the military conflict within the linguocultural, linguocognitive, social and political context. The role of song discourse as part of propaganda and a way to rally the population against the designated enemy is defined. In addition, the relevance of the study is consonant with the socio-political course of Spain in the last few years to deal with the traumatic past of the Civil War and the consequent dictatorship of F. Franco. The material of the study is Spanish-language song texts about the period of the Spanish Civil War (1936– 1939). The main research methods are lexical-semantic, contextual, corpus analysis, methods of semantic and pragmatic interpretation. In addition to the study of the song discourse of the Civil War period, the song discourse of the post-war period is also analyzed. The authors conclude that song and poetry texts acted as an effective tool for rallying the people and quickly conveying the position of the conflicting parties, strengthening propaganda. To date, the musical works of the supporters of the Republic who lost the war in 1939 and after 1939, which were censored in Spain, basking in the popularity, given the campaigns of Spanish public organizations to search for the remains of soldiers and perpetuate the memory of the victims of the Civil War of 1936-1939 and the dictatorship. © 2023, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia.

"The third most common cause of death worldwide is attributed to pulmonary diseases, making it imperative to diagnose them promptly. Radiology is a medical discipline that utilizes medical imaging to guide treatment. Radiologists prepare reports interpreting details and findings analysed from medical images. Radiology free-text reports are a rich source of textual information that can be exploited to enhance the efficacy of medical prognosis, treatment and research. Radiology reports exist in an unstructured format as are not suitable by themselves for mathematical computation or machine learning operations. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) strategies are employed to convert unstructured natural language text into a structured format that can be fed into machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models for information extraction. We propose a DL-based medical text modelling framework incorporating a knowledge base to predict pulmonary diseases from unstructured radiology free-text reports. We make detailed diagnostic performance evaluations of our proposed technique by comparing it with state-of-the-art NLP techniques on radiology free-text reports extracted from two medical institutions. The comprehensive analysis shows that the proposed model achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art text modelling techniques. © 2023 Prague University of Economics and Business.

"Background: Mental illness is a pervasive worldwide public health issue. Residentially vulnerable populations, such as those living in rural medically underserved areas (MUAs) or mental health provider shortage areas (MHPSAs), face unique access barriers to mental health care. Despite the growth of digital mental health interventions using relational agent technology, little is known about their use patterns, efficacy, and favorability among residentially vulnerable populations. Objective: This study aimed to explore differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes, and satisfaction across residential subgroups (metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, or rural), MUAs (yes or no), and MHPSAs (yes or no) among users of a smartphone-based, digital mental health intervention, Woebot LIFE (WB-LIFE). WB-LIFE was designed to help users better understand and manage their moods and features a relational agent, Woebot, that converses through text-based messages. Methods: We used an exploratory study that examined data from 255 adults enrolled in an 8-week, single-arm trial of WB-LIFE. Analyses compared levels of app use and therapeutic alliance total scores as well as subscales (goal, task, and bond), mental health outcomes (depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, resilience, and burnout), and program satisfaction across residential subgroups. Results: Few study participants resided in nonmetropolitan (25/255, 10%) or rural (3/255, 1%) areas, precluding estimates across this variable. Despite a largely metropolitan sample, nearly 39% (99/255) resided in an MUA and 55% (141/255) in an MHPSA. There were no significant differences in app use or satisfaction by MUA or MHPSA status. There also were no differences in depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, resilience, or burnout, with the exception of MUA participants having higher baseline depressive symptoms among those starting in the moderate range or higher (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item scale≥10) than non-MUA participants (mean 16.50 vs 14.41, respectively; P=.01). Although working alliance scores did not differ by MHPSA status, those who resided in an MUA had higher goal (2-tailed t203.47=2.21; P=.03), and bond (t203.47=1.94; P=.05) scores at day 3 (t192.98=2.15; P=.03), and higher goal scores at week 8 (t186.19=2.28; P=.02) as compared with those not living in an MUA. Conclusions: Despite the study not recruiting many participants from rural or nonmetropolitan populations, sizable proportions resided in an MUA or an MHPSA. Analyses revealed few differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes (including baseline levels), or satisfaction across MUA or MHPSA status over the 8-week study. Findings suggest that vulnerable residential populations may benefit from using digital agent–guided cognitive behavioral therapy. ©Valerie L Forman-Hoffman, Maddison C Pirner, Megan Flom, Andrew Kirvin-Quamme, Emily Durden, Jennifer A Kissinger, Athena Robinson.

"The article analyses a manuscript sequence of spiritual poems by Gabriele Fiamma (1533-1585). The sequence is contained in the manuscript N.A. 5 of the Ariostea Library in Ferrara, and is composed by an opening sonnet, and five canzoni written following Petrarchan metrical schemes. Considering the thematic structure of the texts and the organization of the sequence – especially in itsrelation with the probably later publication of Fiamma’s Rime spirituali (1570) – it is conjectured that the selection and the arrangement of the texts could trace back to the author. In the last part the article makes some considerations on the oppositional rhetorical structure in Fiamma’s poetics. © 2023, SISMEL Edizioni del Galluzzo. All rights reserved."
"With the rapid development of internet technology, it has become increasingly straightforward for people to seek and share health information in online health communities (OHCs). However, the current OHCs are mainly centralized systems fraught with data breaches, identity theft, and censorship problem. Some researchers proposed that Web3 technology can provide potential solutions to current problems. In this research, we identify three core components that should empathize in developing OHCs: trust, privacy, and information quality. Accordingly, we surveyed and analyzed Web3 literature and generated the spectrum of Web3 research. Then we applied text analysis to 6 articles we had collected to conduct a co-occurrence network and generate minimum spanning trees. We then discussed the important factors in the technical, application, and service aspects for applying Web3 technology in future OHCs development.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In the coastal areas of China, scientists have collected nearly 500 species of coastal plants and seaweeds. The collected information includes species description, morphological characteristics, habitat distribution and resource value of plants in China. By effectively extracting Chinese text information, this article establishes a Chinese text information extraction model based on DL. This article is based on short-term and short-term memory artificial neural networks for short text classification. In addition, this article also integrates the L-MFCNN models of MFCNN for short text classification. Comparing the two methods with traditional text recognition algorithms, information extraction based on syntax analysis and deep learning, the results show that, compared with the comparison method, the recognition accuracy of Chinese text information of this neural network model can reach 96.69%. Through model training and parameter adjustment, Chinese text information of coastal biodiversity can be quickly extracted, and species categories or names can be identified. © 2023 IGI Global.

"Introduction: Saccular cysts are rare benign anomalies of the larynx (1.5% of laryngeal anomalies) determined by dilatation of the laryngeal saccule. They can be congenital or acquired. Clinical manifestation depends on the site of the cyst and the age of the patient. Children frequently have stridor and dyspnea, while adults usually complain of dysphonia.The therapeutic approach can be surgical or nonsurgical (needle aspiration or drainage).However, guidelines on the management of this disease are lacking in the literature.This systematic literature review was conducted through an interferential analysis with the aim of detecting the association between clinical, diagnostic, and operative factors and the recurrence of saccular cysts. Materials and methods: This systematic literature review was evolved following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist statement Papers published up to August 2023 containing relevant clinical data were searched in Embase/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane database. Full texts lacking information on the patient's data, clinical, radiological, and/or histological diagnosis of saccular cysts of the larynx were excluded. Articles with follow-up inferior to 6 months and not reporting any treatment of the cyst were excluded, too. Data concerning signs and symptoms, cyst characteristics, and the type of treatment were described, and the risk of recurrence was studied in association with these features. A qualitative synthesis of the results was performed. Results: Ninety-eight articles were screened. One hundred two patients were involved in the analysis. The articles with low or intermediate risk of bias were 22 (8 case reports and 14 case series) and they were included in the statistical analysis. Median age was 25 years (range 0–81). Saccular cysts were congenital (46/102, 45%) of cases acquired (56/102, 55%). Relying on the available data, all patients were symptomatic, with stridor as the main symptom (59%). Surgical approach was performed in 85% of cases, while drainage or needle aspiration of the cyst was the treatment of choice in the remaining 25% of cases. Twenty-four percent of patients had recurrence of the disease within 3 months. Median age at recurrence was 9 years. Cysts characteristics, preoperative management, and type of treatment were associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Saccular cysts are rare congenital or acquired laryngeal diseases. Data regarding their management and factors associated with the risk of recurrence are still limited. Congenital cysts treated conservatively have a higher risk of recurrence than acquired cysts treated by open surgical techniques or by microlaryngoscopy. A better knowledge of factors associated with a higher risk of recurrence could help choose the best treatment. © 2023 The Voice Foundation"
"In this article, we investigate independent and handcrafted editorial production (particularly the cartonera edition), focusing on the trajectory of two small publishing houses created in brazilian peripheries in the second decade of the 21st century. We chose a corpus composed of the production of these two cartoneras to interpret the impact of independent editions on the literary field. Starting from an empirical object, which is the experience of editors of books with cardboard covers, we formulate an interpretation of the cartonero phenomenon, focusing particularly on the question of who can and who cannot publish their writings, discussing editorial aspects based on a collection of data related to the trajectory of the two publishers, as well as the use of concepts and the analysis of the texts that integrate the catalogs of Cartonera das Iaiá and Ganesha Cartonera. We also studied black and female authorship in cartoneras, as well as the contribution of this editing technology in voice assumption processes. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The present paper analyses pre-service teachers’ metacognitive actions during the processes of writing and revision of texts in English as a foreign language. Thirty-two students with elementary and intermediate English proficiency levels participated in the study. First, students wrote two texts in English with different cognitive demands (a summary and an essay) about some previously watched films. Metacognitive actions performed on each text were measured and related to the linguistic proficiency level and the task demand. Results showed that most of the control actions taken belonged to the superficial mental representation level. They were mainly aimed at correcting grammatical mistakes. Moreover, participants found more difficulties in the elaboration and revision processes when facing a high cognitive demanding task, such as writing an essay. © (2023), All Rights Reserved."
"Purpose: This paper aims to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the quality of integrated reports (IR) and highlight the gaps in the existing research to provide directions and suggestions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted through a systematic literature review using content analysis based on 40 papers from the Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCOhost databases on IR quality. While reading the full-text papers, the authors found six additional papers referenced by the literature being reviewed that were relevant to IR quality. Thus, there were 46 papers in the final review. The analysis begins with the definition and dimension of IR quality and theoretical lenses. Furthermore, this study outlines constructs or variables used in the previous literature. Findings: The authors found that most studies used the quantitative method (41 papers or 89%). Five papers in the literature used qualitative methods (11%). Most researchers (34 papers or 72%) defined IR quality as consistent with the International Integrated Reporting Council framework, specifically the eight content elements. In particular, with the constructs that make up the quality of the IR, variations between researchers were found. Furthermore, there were some gaps that could be the directions for future research. Research limitations/implications: The literature that provides academic knowledge about IR quality is still limited, and research on IR is still growing. The literature review conducted by this study can provide an overview of the current research positions on the quality of IR and directions for future research in this area. Practical implications: This study intends to show corporate executives a framework demonstrating the quality of corporate reporting. It can impact not only investors as a specific stakeholder group but also other stakeholder groups. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first literature review to examine the quality of IR, thus providing a map of current research to suggest directions for future research. Most of the previous literature reviews have been focused on integrated reporting (IR) in general and not quality. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Introduction: Individuals with chronic physical illness are at increased risk of negative psychological sequelae. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is an emerging treatment that might reduce these negative effects and increase quality of life in individuals with chronic physical illness. Objective: To systematically review literature examining the use of immersive VR in adult populations with chronic physical illness to understand: (1) how immersive VR is used to improve psychological well-being of adults with chronic physical illness (2) what effect this immersive VR has on the psychological well-being of adults with chronic physical illness. Design: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Searches of Ovid Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus between July 1993 and March 2023 inclusive. Results: 12 811 texts were identified; 31 met the inclusion criteria. Relaxing and engaging immersive VR interventions were shown to be acceptable and feasible among adults with cancer, dementia, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and multiple sclerosis. Many of the studies reviewed were feasibility or pilot studies and so the evidence about effectiveness is more limited. The evidence, mostly from studies of people with cancer, suggests that immersive VR can have a positive effects on anticipatory anxiety symptoms and pain. Conclusions: Environment-based and game-based relaxing immersive VR offer novel interventions, with beneficial effects among people with cancer and, potentially, beneficial effects in those with other long-term physical illness. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"While topic modelling is a contemporary method for analysing large sets of texts and documents, including short texts like tweets and reviews, very few special datasets have been released to benchmark the performance of topic modelling algorithms. These algorithms are usually evaluated based on human assessment and topic coherence. In this paper we present the HRAST (Hotel Reviews: Aspects, Sentiments and Topics) dataset, consisting of 23114 sentences extracted from hotel reviews. These sentences were manually classified into 21 different (but overlapping) topics (hotel aspects) while their sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) was also manually assessed. A subset of 5812 sentences express aspects in a contradicting manner, i.e., different aspects assessed via contradicting sentiments, and can be used for benchmarking aspect-based sentiment analysis methods. Some initial experiments for both sentiment analysis and topic modelling, to explain the use of the dataset, have been conducted using state-of-The-Art algorithms.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The paremiological fund of language either explicitly or implicitly expresses information about the value system of the people. The study is devoted to the description of labor as a value of European and Asian peoples on the basis of paremiological material. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that, proceeding from the analysis of authentic dictionaries of proverbs, the main semantic dominants of Russian, French and Kalmyk proverbs about labor were identified, as well as linguistic means of representing this value, due to both — universal features and the specifics of the studied linguistic cultures. Through a continuous selection of published and handwritten paremiographic sources, the author’s card file was compiled, numbering about 1000 items. The most representative examples served as illustrative material for the study, in the description of which the descriptive-analytical method was used, as well as the linguo-axiological and linguo-culturological methods which have received theoretical justification in recent years. Comparative analysis showed that in the three linguistic cultures a positive attitude towards labor dominates, which is a value opposed to laziness and idleness, which act as anti-values in proverbs. The following were established as the main axiological dominants: the connection between work and life in abundance, the need for effort and effort in work, the assessment of labor activity based on its results. An important function belongs to the components of proverbs related to labor (names of professions and occupations, attributes of labor that have certain symbols), through images, models of human behavior are transmitted. The mentioning of these components is associated with the development of various types of labor activity that were developed during the creation of proverbs. In French proverbs, the emphasis is made on the fact that labor is a value bringing material wealth, they value individual labor, and not the collective one, which is associated with the orientation of European French culture, belonging to the individualist type, being not at all the characteristic of the Eurasian Russian and Asian Kalmyk cultures. Among the axiological markers, the means of different language levels were singled out: a special rhythmic organization of the text; lexemes with evaluative semantics; the reception of repetition and the use of contrast, which allows, in particular, to express scenarios of behavior through anti-scripts, specific grammatical constructions. In Russian proverbs, proper nouns with the suffix of subjective evaluation-к-can be attributed to the means of expressing evaluation; in French and Kalmyk material, such axiological markers are absent, due to the typological features of the languages under consideration. © 2023, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia.

"Depression is an abstinent health ailment that affronts several people globally, affecting a consistent decline in mood resulting in a trivial impact on their emotions. The article centers around the utilization of BERT based features and Autoencoders to identify depression from textual input, while also exploring gender identity variations. The study emphasizes the importance of feature engineering for text data obtained from the DAIC_WOZ benchmark dataset. By employing BERT embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of text, in combination with Autoencoders and additional quantitative characteristics such as PHQ-8 participant feedback, assessment of absolutist word usage, and gender details, the model's performance is significantly improved. We conduct trials with BERT embeddings that encode the textual meaning to extract text characteristics. These features are subsequently combined using Autoencoders. Our method surpasses the performance of the baseline models, achieving an accuracy of 95.5%. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) is measured at 3.75 and the root mean squared error (RMSE) at 5.02, demonstrating the exceptional performance for binary depression classification. These discoveries reveal the capacity of machine learning in mental health investigation, especially when considering gender disparities. © 2023 IEEE."
"In this study, we apply text analysis and machine learning algorithms to study how to improve the satisfaction of Xiamen's green development. Through binary logical regression and the XGBoost algorithm, we find out the important factors that affect the satisfaction of Xiamen's green development and establish a logical regression equation. Through the public complaint text and reply text data captured in the consultation and complaint module of the Xiamen Ecological Environment Bureau, we establish the word frequency statistics and semantic networks. According to the research results, we proposed strategies to improve the satisfaction of green development in Xiamen. © 2023 IEEE."
"To address the influence of initial cluster center selection on K-means, we propose IPSOK-means, a text clustering method that utilizes improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). IPSOK-means incorporates a self-adjusting inertia weight mechanism to enhance population diversity and exploration capabilities.

"the Conte du Graal and Great Expectations · Chrétien de Troyes’s Conte du Graal and Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations are two examples of narratives concerned with the personal development of an individual as he learns about himself and tries to find his place in the world. They stand at the beginning and at the height of the development of the European Bildungsroman; Great Expectations is also known for its distinctive treatment of the genre, which sets it apart from other novels, such as Dickens’s own David Copperfield. This study focuses on a comparison between the Conte du Graal and Great Expectations showing that both texts share a similar narrative structure and a number of themes and motifs. The analysis of these shared features allows us to understand the different approaches to the theme of personal development in the texts and also their role in the development of the Bildungsroman tradition. © 2023 Fabrizio Serra Editore.

"Student presentations conducted with the help of PowerPoint represent communicative events that are inherently multimodal by incorporating visuals on slides accompanied by spoken commentary. However, despite their ubiquity in higher education, few studies have investigated the rhetorical relations between their auditory and visual modes. This study attempts to address this gap by applying theoretical frameworks for logico-semantics and image–text relations to student presentations conducted online at a private university in Japan. Analysis of over 5 hours of recorded data revealed how clauses in students’ spoken commentary related to visible entities on the screen primarily through exposition and, to a lesser extent, specification, summary, extension and enhancement. A further comparison of different stages within the presentations showed that summary and expansion played a bigger role whenever students provided background information or concluded the presentation. Further, qualitative discussion on selected excerpts sheds light on how the reading path alternated between exposition of visual text through repetition or synonymy and embellishment through specification or enhancement. However, comparing students also indicated that genre-specifics are not yet established for all students. The selection and configuration of logico-semantic relations influenced how slides compensated for verbal deficiencies, which has implications for the English as a Foreign Language context. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Writing a well-structured scientific documents, such as articles and theses, is vital for comprehending the document's argumentation and understanding its messages. Furthermore, it has an impact on the efficiency and time required for studying the document. Proper document segmentation also yields better results when employing automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) manipulation algorithms, including summarization and other information retrieval and analysis functions. Unfortunately, inexperienced writers, such as young researchers and graduate students, often struggle to produce well-structured professional documents. Their writing frequently exhibits improper segmentations or lacks semantically coherent segments, a phenomenon referred to as ""mal-segmentation."" Examples of mal-segmentation include improper paragraph or section divisions and unsmooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs. This research addresses the issue of mal-segmentation in scientific writing by introducing an automated method for detecting mal-segmentations, and utilizing Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (sBERT) as an encoding mechanism. The experimental results section shows a promising results for the detection of mal-segmentation using the sBERT technique. © 2023, Polish Association for Knowledge Promotion. All rights reserved."

"There are small differences between different retail product images belong to the same category, such as product models, sizes, and tastes. Retail product images do not have target local regions which can be used for detection and classification. Besides, the differences between subcategories are more subtle. These make fine-grained image classification for retail product images more challenging. It is hard to locate discriminative local areas in the product images, which are widely used in training for specific area detection such as head and trunk in fine-grained classification of birds images. However, the existing fine-grained image classification for product images only use image features to target local regions, but ignore text features in the images. Product images contain rich text information. Text feature is a very important component in product images. Since text recognition methods do not achieve satisfactory results on retail product images of low quality, we consider introducing text area features into fuzzy product image classification. We propose a fine-grained classification method for blur retail product images combining the features of text regions. First, we use the density-based clustering method to find category key areas in the text regions detected in the product images. Secondly, combine the key text areas features in the image when doing fine-grained classification. Experimental results show that our method achieves a higher classification accuracy in blur retail product image classifications, getting 4% improvement in the original classification results.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Society is witnessing two parallel phenomena: an increase in the number of mobile phone users worldwide and a growing concern about problematic smartphone use. Leading explanatory models suggest that social reward may explain some problematic smartphone use. Given that experimental evidence about the impact of social variables on problematic smartphone use is scarce, the impact of social expectancy on emotional arousal measured with skin conductance response (SCR) was analysed during instant messaging. Method: A sample of 86 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to two groups. Experimental group participants were instructed to send a social expectation-generating message to their more active contacts in their preferred social network. After experiencing a virtual reality distraction environment, participants’ SCR was measured when they were allowed to use the smartphone and when it was withdrawn. Results: Participants in the experimental group showed a higher SCR response than the control group. Peaks analysis also showed that peak amplitude was higher in experimental participants when their smartphones were used and withdrawn. Experimental participants also showed a longer half recovery time when using the smartphone. Conclusions: Social expectancy is a critical variable in understanding problematic smartphone use and it should be considered in clinical contexts. © 2023, Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias.

"Several previous studies have suggested using statistical machine translation instead of neural machine translation for extremely low-resource languages. We could translate texts from 12 different regional languages into Indonesian using machine translation experiments. We increased the accuracy of machine translation for 12 extremely low-resource languages by using several monolingual corpus sizes on the language model’s target side. Since many Indonesian sources are available, we added this corpus to improve the model’s performance. Our study aims to analyze and evaluate the impact of different language models trained on various monolingual corpus on the accuracy of machine translation. The increase in accuracy when enlarging the monolingual corpus is not observed every time, according to our experiments. Therefore, it is necessary to perform several experiments to determine the monolingual corpus to optimize the quality. Experiments showed that Melayu Pontianak achieved the highest bilingual evaluation understudy improvement point. Specifically, we found that by adding a monolingual corpus of 50–100K, they performed a bilingual evaluation understudy improvement point of 2.15, the highest improvement point they reached for any of the twelve languages tested. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: To verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in the usability test of the tinnitus assessment application. Methods: This is a descriptive usability test study that assessed the satisfaction, effectiveness, and efficiency of the application. The test was carried out virtually via Google Forms. First, the participants received instructions on how to access and use Avazum, through texts and illustrative images. Afterward, the users used the application, observing its functions and usability. Next, the participants answered the usability questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 21.0, to perform descriptive analysis such as frequency, percentages of data in the System Usability Questionnaire (SUS), and analysis in the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Results: Thus, the overall mean SUS score was consistent with satisfactory usability, which implies that the application does not present serious usability problems. Also, the overall NPS percentage indicated very good user satisfaction, with a good percentage of promoting users. As far as effectiveness is concerned, it was found that Avazum reached its goals, besides being efficient, as it uses clear language and is comfortably used. Conclusion: Avazum obtained very good satisfaction from users, in addition to achieving its goals. It proved to be effective, has clear language, and is comfortably used, adducing efficiency in the multidisciplinary evaluation of tinnitus. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a liceEste é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado.nça Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado."
"Background: Numerous individual and environmental factors including diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear to what degree dietary intake is affected in individuals with IBS. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize dietary intake of adults with IBS and to compare dietary intake between adults with IBS and non-IBS controls. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched through February 2023 for clinical trials and observational studies measuring usual diet in adults with IBS. Pooled weighted averages were estimated for total energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient data. Mean differences (MD) in nutrient intake were estimated for adults with IBS versus non-IBS controls using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency index (I2). Key Results: Sixty-three full-text articles were included in the review of which 29 studies included both IBS and control subjects. Nutrients not meeting the recommended intake level for any dietary reference values in the IBS population were fiber and vitamin D. Meta-regression by female proportion was positively correlated with total fat intake and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake. Comparisons between participants with IBS and controls showed significantly lower fiber intake in participants with IBS with high heterogeneity (MD: −1.8; 95% CI: −3.0, −0.6; I2 = 85%). Conclusions and Inferences: This review suggests that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS; however, overall dietary intake does not appear to be comprised. Causes and consequences of reduced fiber in IBS deserve further study. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS. However, overall intake of other macro- and micronutrients does not appear to be compromised. Causes and consequences of reduced fiber and Vitamin D intake in IBS deserve further study. © 2023 The Authors. Neurogastroenterology & Motility published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) formulates image classification as an image-to-text matching task, i.e., matching images to the corresponding natural language descriptions instead of discrete category IDs. This allows for open-vocabulary visual recognition, where the model can recognize images from an open class set (also known as an open vocabulary) in a zero-shot manner. However, evaluating the openness of CLIP-like models is challenging, as the models are open to arbitrary vocabulary in theory, but their accuracy varies in practice. To address this, we resort to an incremental perspective to assess the openness through vocabulary expansions, and define extensibility to measure a model's ability to handle novel classes. Our evaluation shows that CLIP-like models are not truly open, and their performance deteriorates as the vocabulary expands. We further dissect the feature space of CLIP from the perspectives of representation alignment and uniformity. Our investigation reveals that the overestimation of openness is due to confusion among competing text features, rather than a failure to capture the similarity between image features and text features of novel classes. We hope that our investigation and analysis will facilitate future research on the CLIP openness issue. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"The growing body of creativity research involves Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) approaches to automatically evaluating creative solutions. However, numerous challenges persist in evaluating the creativity dimensions and the methodologies employed for automatic evaluation. This paper contributes to this research gap with a scoping review that maps the Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to computations of different creativity dimensions. The review has two research objectives to cover the scope of automatic creativity evaluation: to identify different computational approaches and techniques in creativity evaluation and, to analyze the automatic evaluation of different creativity dimensions. As a first result, the scoping review provides a categorization of the automatic creativity research in the reviewed papers into three NLP approaches, namely: text similarity, text classification, and text mining. This categorization and further compilation of computational techniques used in these NLP approaches help ameliorate their application scenarios, research gaps, research limitations, and alternative solutions. As a second result, the thorough analysis of the automatic evaluation of different creativity dimensions differentiated the evaluation of 25 different creativity dimensions. Attending similarities in definitions and computations, we characterized seven core creativity dimensions, namely: novelty, value, flexibility, elaboration, fluency, feasibility, and others related to playful aspects of creativity. We hope this scoping review could provide valuable insights for researchers from psychology, education, AI, and others to make evidence-based decisions when developing automated creativity evaluation.

"Purpose: This study aimed to assess the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) as a study tool in solving biostatistical problems and to identify any potential drawbacks that might arise from using ChatGPT in medical education, particularly in solving practical biostatistical problems. Methods: ChatGPT was tested to evaluate its ability to solve biostatistical problems from the Handbook of Medical Statistics by Peacock and Peacock in this descriptive study. Tables from the problems were transformed into textual questions. Ten biostatistical problems were randomly chosen and used as text-based input for conversation with ChatGPT (versions 3.5 and 4). Results: GPT-3.5 solved five practical problems in the first attempt, related to categorical data, cross-sectional study, measuring reliability, probability properties, and the t-test. GPT-3.5 failed to provide correct answers regarding ANOVA, the chi-square test, and sample size within 3 attempts. GPT-4 also solved a task related to the confidence interval in the first attempt and solved all questions within 3 attempts, with precise guidance and monitoring. Conclusion: The assessment of both versions of ChatGPT performance in 10 biostatistical problems revealed that GPT-3.5 and 4’s performance was below average, with correct response rates of 5 and 6 out of 10 on the first attempt. GPT-4 succeeded in providing all correct answers within 3 attempts. These findings indicate that students must be aware that this tool, even when providing and calculating different statistical analyses, can be wrong, and they should be aware of ChatGPT’s limitations and be careful when incorporating this model into medical education. © 2023 Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute."
"Nowadays, the electric vehicle industry is developing rapidly. However, the frequent reports of electric vehicle accidents in the news also make consumers doubt its safety performance. Due to the complexity of the use environment, a large number of potential failure modes are difficult to detect before leaving the factory. There are real-time feedback from consumers on social media, which can help enterprises collect product defect information in time. Therefore, we propose an improved failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method that combines text mining and multi-view group consensus. On the one hand, it utilizes text mining and deep learning methods to build the product component dictionary and the failure word dictionary to classify defect-related texts and identify failure modes in social media data. On the other hand, considering the cardinal consensus and the classification consensus, the minimum adjustment consensus model is constructed in the proposed FMEA method to obtain the decision results of failure modes with the consistency of evaluation information and classification results. Finally, a case study of Tesla electric vehicles and comparison analyses are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed FMEA method. With respect to general machine learning methods, the proposed FMEA method can find defect-related texts in social media data more accurately and comprehensively. Compared with the previous FMEA methods, the proposed FMEA method can not only identify failure modes in social media data, but also obtain consistent decision-making results with multi-view group consensus. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: Digital technology is a means to uphold or violate human rights in various domains, including business, military, and health. Given the pervasiveness of mobile technology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), mobile health (mHealth) interventions present an opportunity to reach remote populations and enable them to exercise civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to health and education. Simultaneously, the ubiquity of mobile phones involves processing sensitive data which can threaten rights, including the right to privacy and nondiscrimination. Digital health is often promoted as advancing human rights and health equity; however, digital rights are underexplored in the literature on mHealth in LMICs. As such, creating an understanding of the digital rights topics covered in the 2022 literature is important to avoid exacerbating existing inequities relating to digital health design, use, implementation, and access. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify digital rights topics in the 2022 peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs. Methods: The Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping reviews guides this review. Searches were performed across 7 electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and PubMed). The screening processes were guided by the research question “What digital rights topics have been explored in the 2022 literature on mHealth in LMICs?” Only papers addressing mHealth in LMICs and digital rights topics were included. Data extraction will include publication title, year, and type; first author’s affiliation country; LMICs implicated; infrastructure challenges; study aims, design, limitations, and future work; health area; mHealth technology, functions, purpose or application, and target end users; human or digital right terms used; explicit rights topics cited; and implied rights topics. The results will be reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Results: This scoping review was registered in Open Science Framework (December 22, 2022). Title and abstract screening and full-text paper screening were completed in 2023. This resulted in 56 papers being included in the study. The target date for completing data extraction and publishing a case study of the initial findings is the end of 2023. The full scoping review findings are expected to be disseminated through various pathways benefiting academia, practice, and policy making by the end of 2024. These include journal papers, conference presentations, publicly available toolkits for research and practice, public webinars, and policy briefs with evidence-based policy recommendations emerging from this review. Conclusions: The planned scoping review will identify digital rights topics in the 2022 literature at the intersection of mHealth and LMICs. Furthermore, it will highlight the importance of patient empowerment, data protection, and inclusion in mHealth research and related policies in LMICs. © 2023 American Roentgen Ray Society.

"Sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic detection and classification of opinions expressed in texts. Emojis can be used to determine the sentiment polarities of the texts (i.e. positive, negative, or neutral). Several studies demonstrated how sentiment analysis is accurate when emojis are used (Kaity and Balakrishnan, 2020). While they have used emojis as features to improve the performance of sentiment analysis systems, in this paper we analyse the use of emojis to reduce the manual effort in labelling text for training those systems. Furthermore, we investigate the manual effort reduction in the sentiment labelling process with the help of sentiment-bearing words as well as the combination of sentiment-bearing words and emojis. In addition to English, we evaluated the approaches with the low-resource African languages Sepedi, Setswana, and Sesotho. The combination of emojis and words sentiment lexicon shows better performance compared to emojis-only lexicons and words-based lexicons. Our results show that our emoji sentiment lexicon approach is effective, with an accuracy of 75% more than other sentiment lexicon approaches, which have an average accuracy of 69.1%. Furthermore, our distant supervision method obtained an accuracy of 77.0%. We anticipate that only 23% of the tweets will need to be changed as a result of our annotation strategies. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Background: Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) is widely acknowledged globally as an effective method for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS. It allows people to understand their HIV status, make informed choices about getting tested for it, evaluate their personal risk of contracting HIV, and create plans to reduce that risk. The study aimed to evaluate the process of VCT services in public health facilities of Akaki Kality sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: A case study evaluation design with a mixed method was employed from May 12 to June 12, 2021. A total of 244 clients were interviewed during the study period. Furthermore, 12 direct observations, a review of documents from the past six months to the study period, and 12 key informant interviews were conducted. Quantitative data were entered into Epi data 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Univariate analysis was done and presented in tables and texts. Qualitative data were transcribed, translated, coded, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The overall service implementation process was measured on the basis of pre-determined judgmental criteria. Results: The overall level of VCT service implementation was 83.84%, to which the availability of resources (84.8%), compliance of service providers with the national guidelines (85.38%), and client satisfaction (76.93%) contributed. One facility had stock-outs of test kits in the last three months, and all VCT counseling and testing rooms lacked audio-visual privacy. Supportive supervision, the use of IEC materials during counseling, linking all HIV-positive clients to treatment and care services, and sending complete reports were practiced in a way that needs some improvement. Conclusion: Overall, the service implementation was deemed satisfactory, but further action is required to improve resource availability, ensure provider compliance with national guidelines, and enhance the status of the service. In addition, the Woreda Health Office and Addis Abeba Health Bureau should regularly supervise and provide feedback. © 2023 Masrie et al."
"Stock photos from commercial image banks are extensively used in a variety of texts, such as news reports, organizational websites, sponsored social media posts, and information brochures. This article aims at showing how and why commercial digital image banks can be apt resources for critical literacy work, demonstrated through a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 150 stock images of teenagers fromScandinavia’s most influential commercial image bank, Colourbox. The analysis maps social interests and ideals that Colourbox are inscribed with, including representations of gender and ethnicity. Based on the findings, the article argues that critical literacy work with stock photos can bring increased critical awareness of visual images, of visual representation of social actors, and of digital technologies as sociocultural phenomena. The study is theoretically informed by social semiotic perspectives on multimodality and digital technology in combination with critical literacy studies, including critical discourse analysis. © 2023 Author(s).

"Background: The principles of gender equality are integral to the goals, targets, and indicators of all sustainable development goals. Higher education institutes can be powerful agents for promoting gender equality, diversity, and inclusion not only in the higher education context but also in society as a whole. To address and overcome gender inequality in the higher education environment, experts posit that change needs to occur from day 1 of the student’s academic experience. To this end, training is required. A preliminary review of the literature indicates that multiple gender equality–based training programs or initiatives for students have been designed and evaluated in second and third-level education settings. Examples of educational activities undertaken include delivery of didactic teaching, participation in a face-to-face collaboration project, site visits, case studies, and coaching. Yet, our initial search indicated that, to date, a comprehensive review collating the available evidence on gender equality training for third-level students has not yet been carried out. Objective: Our review seeks to identify and explore the existing literature on gender equality training interventions for third-level students, with a particular emphasis on training content, methodology, and outcome evaluation. Methods: This scoping review will be structured using the Arskey and O’Malley’s 5-stage framework and will consider empirical research and other relevant published works that address gender equality training. Systematic searches will be carried out in 6 research databases and the gray literature using key search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been defined, and a data charting tool created to methodically extract information from selected literature. The free web software Rayyan will be used for primary screening where each reference will be screened in duplicate first by title, then abstract, and finally by full text. Results: This review forms part of the LIBRA (Balance) study and has received peer-reviewed grant funding from the Irish Higher Education Authority. LIBRA aims to use simulation-based education to develop a gender equality leadership training program for student leaders in higher education. The findings will be summarized in tabular form, and a narrative synthesis produced to inform curriculum development. Conclusions: This review seeks to inform curriculum design by reporting on the gender equality–enabling skills and leadership skills necessary to foster gender equality. This paper should inform recommendations for training and catalyze future research in this rapidly evolving area. © 2023 JMIR Publications Inc.."
"Internationally, the emphasis on school reforms is increasing, and school leaders play a key role in realising reform initiatives for school development and change. Often, the formation of partnerships between researchers and practitioners for school improvement is promoted to facilitate professional development and enhance student learning. However, limited attention has been directed towards the underlying ideas, values and beliefs in government-initiated strategies for partnership in the policy context of educational reform. This paper examines how partnerships between schools and higher education institutions are conceptualised and legitimised in Norwegian reform policy documents. We analyse three government white papers, each coupled with an executive partnership strategy document. The analysis applies a discourse analytical approach to policy as text and transmission. Our findings show a shift in the official national discourse on partnerships in education, underscoring new tensions regarding the power to define focus areas in the local reform work. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Purpose: This study aimed to measure the frequency of high-quality and transparent sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection and reporting in highly cited current alcohol use research, using the extant literature to identify community-informed priorities for the measurement of these variables. Methods: A single search to identify alcohol use literature was conducted on PubMed with results restricted to primary research articles published between 2015 and 2022. The 200 most highly cited studies from each year were identified and their titles and abstracts reviewed against inclusion criteria after deduplication. After full-text review, study characteristics and data indicating quality of SOGI reporting were extracted. The fidelity of the results was verified with a random sample before analyses. Results: The final sample comprised 580 records. Few studies reported gender identity (n = 194; 33.4%) and, of these, 7.2% reported the associated gender identity measure. A two-stage approach to measure gender was adopted in 3 studies, one study used an open-ended question with a free-text response option, and 13 studies recorded nonbinary gender identities (reported by 0.9% of the whole sample). Nineteen (3.3%) studies reported sexual orientation and more than half of these provided the sexual orientation measure. Eight of the 20 studies that reported sexual orientation and/or gender identity measures were classified as sexual and gender minority specialist research. Conclusions: Culturally competent SOGI reporting is lacking in highly cited current alcohol research. SOGI measures should be disclosed in future research and should provide free-text response options. Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."
"When discussing the relationship between humour and racism, research usually concentrates on ethnic or racist jokes or on other humorous texts which expressly target migrants or other minorities. Relevant studies more or less explicitly ascribe to critical humour studies investigating topics such as how and why humour targeting the linguistic, cultural, or religious Other reproduces and maintains social discrimination and inequality, as well as how and why the generic conventions of humorous genres do not incite the audience to think critically of their content but instead enhance their tolerance for discriminatory and racist standpoints. In this context, the present study explores humorous texts that at first sight appear to have antiracist intentions. More specifically, I analyse a corpus of satirical news coming from popular Greek websites and targeting majority people for their racist views and practices towards migrants. The analysis is based on the concepts of script opposition and target as defined in the framework of the General Theory of Verbal Humour. The findings suggest that distinguishing between antiracist and racist interpretations is not an easy or straightforward matter: humour seems to blur the boundary between racism and antiracism. In order to account for this dimension of humour, I exploit the concept of liquid racism put forward by Weaver (The Rhetoric of Racist Humour) to account for the ambiguities of humorous discourse when it involves racist and antiracist meanings and interpretations. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) modes have been successfully applied in several areas like computer vision, and intelligent manufacturing. They have great potential to improve the efficiency and security of power control systems. Before selecting and applying an appropriate AI model in a commercial power control system, it is necessary to test all candidate AI models and evaluate their performance. However, there are few studies on the systemic process of testing AI models and evaluating their performance. To this end, this paper presents a novel AI model testing and evaluation framework and introduces the AI model performance evaluation metrics and methods. Then, the AI model's testing process is described, and the methods of AI model training, model testing, result analysis, and model evaluation are described in detail. To facilitate the understanding of AI model evaluation methodology and for the task of malicious traffic identification, we give a specific case to show the testing and evaluation performance of the proposed text CNN and other benchmark deep learning models in terms of efficiency and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Orofacial pain conditions are complex disorders that involve biological, social, and psychological factors. Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) are one of the most common orofacial pain conditions, and our previous literature review indicated that exercise therapy has shown promise in reducing TMD-related pain. However, more evidence is needed to firmly establish its effectiveness. Objectives: This systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of exercise therapy on pain relief and jaw mobility in patients with pain-related TMDs. Methods: To include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) written in English, a literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBM reviews, and Academic Search Complete initially from 4th November 2020 until March 2022. A PICOS for this review was as follows; P: Patients with TMD myalgia or arthralgia, I: Excursion exercise, Stretch exercises, Resistance exercise, or Coordination exercise, C: No treatment or education only. O: Pain intensity and Range of Motion (ROM), S: RCTs. After title screening, a full-text assessment was done to extract data. According to Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0, risk of bias was assessed in each included paper by 2 reviewers independently. Results: A total of 3,388 titles were identified from the electronic database search. After the screening and full-text evaluation, only 5 studies (145 participants) were eligible to be included. Among the exercise modalities, coordination exercise showed a significant effect on pain relief and improvement of joint mobility. Discussion: Due to the heterogeneity and small sample size of the included studies, a meta-analysis was not feasible. However, this systematic review suggested that exercise therapy, especially coordinate exercise, can be effective in managing painful TMD conditions. Further research is needed to establish optimal parameters for this patient population, as well as standardization and consistency in terminology and treatment structure. 2023 Shimada, Ogawa, Sammour, Narihara, Kinomura, Koide, Noma and Sasaki."
"OBJECTIVES: Using the examples of the Social Workers College in Ostrava and the Secondary School of Social Law in Prague, we strive to understand how the first development phase of practice wisdom was constructed through the educational process of social work after 1945. THEORETICAL BASE: The study of social work history is considered important for strengthening the identity of social workers and anchoring the basic values and goals of the profession. The content of their education is the first developmental stage in the construction of practice wisdom, which shapes specific professional knowledge. METHODS: Methodologically, the text is supported by historical research: (1) content analysis of primary sources from Ostrava and (2) the oral histories of graduates from Prague. OUTCOMES: The result is a synthesis of knowledge on the constitution of education of social work after 1945, which presents the perception of knowledge gain as the initial phase of the construction of practice wisdom. SOCIAL WORK IMPLICATIONS: This may contribute to our understanding of the history of social work and enhance our ideas on education as a prerequisite for the emergence of practice wisdom. © 2023, Czech Association of Educators in Social Work.

"Digital platforms have revolutionized the way illegal drug trafficking is taking place. Modern drug dealers use social network platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, as direct-to-consumer marketing tools. But apart from the marketing side, drug dealers also use fintech payment apps to engage in financial transactions with their clients. In this work, we leverage a large dataset from Venmo to investigate the digital money trail of drug dealers and the social networks they create. Using text and social network analytics, we identify two types of illicit users: mixed-activity participants and heavy drug traffickers and build a random forest classifier that accurately predicts both types of illicit nodes. We then investigate the social network structure of drug dealers on Venmo and find that heavy drug traffickers share similar network characteristics with previous literature findings on drug trafficking networks. However, mixed-activity participants exhibit different patterns of network structure characteristics, including a higher clustering coefficient, suggesting that they may be accessing multiple networks and bridging those networks through their illicit activities. Our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between these two types of illicit users and provide law enforcement agencies with valuable insights that can aid in combating illegal drug transactions in digital payment apps. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The reader will have noticed the non-standard appearance of this piece. Indeed, we are used to reading papers which are either survey papers or research ones (or a mixture of both). However, it seems to be beneficial for a given field to sometimes take a pause and to observe the picture of the field’s development in a broad sense, from “above”, and to examine the directions in which things are progressing, in various directions, at the same time. This collection of short essays on some particular subdirections of the theory is an attempt to present such an overview. In recent years Asymptotic Geometric Analysis has grown enormously in its areas of interest, directions and results. Trying to understand and digest the picture of this development, I asked several experts who are close to me and represent the centers of various directions, to write for me a very concise and short description of their present central interests. More precisely, that part of their interests that relates to Asymptotic Geometric Analysis. Many agreed, and I am posting below the short texts I received. After each of them, I will place my comments, as well as some problems that arise when reading these texts. Of course, I know that a few promising and interesting directions are missing. Some articles I expected, I did not receive, and some directions are not active at present around me. It is my hope that such a presentation will add curiosity to some questions for experts, but more important, it will have, hopefully, a positive influence on the young generation joining this field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"In this paper, by collecting a large number of 3D scenes with traditional cultural styles, after pre-processing, the style analysis task of 3D scenes is realized through two stages of model style element discovery and scene style pattern mining. In the style pattern mining stage, the maximum frequent pattern mining algorithm is used to get the style pattern of the final scene, and the part is visualized. To reduce the user's selection time, a 3D interior layout recommendation system based on style rule mining is designed using collaborative filtering. Based on the previous work on scene style pattern mining, the style association rules are further mined, and the user is provided with candidate layouts and furniture dynamically and in real-time by introducing user interaction. Comparing the text-improved recommendation algorithm with the traditional recommendation algorithm, the accuracy rate of the traditional algorithm starts to saturate to 65% after TopN>20, while the algorithm in this paper is higher than 80%. In the analysis of traditional cultural contexts of interior art, in terms of the aesthetic acquisition, the highest proportion of aesthetic association is 63.7%. In terms of emotional expression, the proportion of symbolization of emotion is 73.1%. In terms of object comparison, the highest proportion of plurality and flexibility of combinations was 57.5%. Therefore, this paper provides good research ideas for how to better integrate traditional culture into interior design.  © 2023 Shuhua Zhu, published by Sciendo 2023."
"Purpose: to describe the profile of fluency concerning the typology of disfluencies, speed, and frequency of disruptions in spontaneous speech, reading, and retelling; to compare the fluency profile in adults who stutter in spontaneous speech, reading, and retelling of text. Methods: The present work is a cross-sectional comparative study with a sample composed of 15 adults who stutter of both sexes, with higher education or equivalent to complete elementary school II. Samples were collected in the tasks of spontaneous speech, reading, and text retelling through video calls made individually with the participants. The first 200 syllables expressed in each task were transcribed and analyzed according to the Fluency Profile Assessment Protocol (FPAP). The study compared the frequency of common and stuttering disfluencies and the speed in the different tasks surveyed. The Kruskal & Wallis test was used together with Duncan’s multiple comparisons test to compare the medians and verify possible differences between the tasks researched with a significance level of 5%. Results: The reading task presented a lower number of common disfluencies and a percentage of speech discontinuity about spontaneous speech and retelling tasks. No statistically significant differences were found between stuttering disfluencies in the three tasks surveyed. Conclusion: This study showed that there are differences in the occurrence of common disfluencies - hesitations, interjections, and revisions - and in the percentage of speech discontinuity during an oral reading of adults who stutter concerning spontaneous speech and text retelling. © Este é um artigo publicado em acesso aberto (Open Access) sob a licença Creative Commons Attribution, que permite uso, distribuição e reprodução em qualquer meio, sem restrições desde que o trabalho original seja corretamente citado."
"What do berries, avocado, quinoa, and ginger have in common? These food items are often regarded as superfoods, a marketing term that overstates the importance of single food items for one’s health and wellbeing. In the present paper, we set out to investigate how purported superfoods are represented in the discourse of online news. We use computational language models to extract the unique topics and terms used to discuss superfoods. Our results show that news coverage is dominated by many specific claims about the healing properties of superfoods. The structural topic model further demonstrates that articles mentioning superfoods are more likely to include topics about a) nutrients, physical appearance, and health in the same context, b) retail strategies, and c) scientific research about the health benefits of superfoods. These results illustrate complex representations of superfoods in news media. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"The foundation of the global and Indian economies is agriculture. Since agriculture started millions of years ago, many environments, civilizations, and technical developments have fostered and defined the evolution of agricultural technology. In this study, we examine how we may analyze images of plants and soil to better keep tabs on their health, as well as how we can determine how much water each kind of plant needs. Images of the plants and soil are first taken using a digital camera with the necessary resolution. The form and geometric characteristics are extracted from the plant images using the inner distance shape context-based descriptor and geometrical descriptors. The soil images are also used to extract features and color properties. The botanical plant species dictionary is used to identify the plant type using the contour elements of the plant photos. Gradient structured random forest (GS-RF) classification is used to forecast leaf diseases. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Gradient Deep Neural Network (HG-DNN) classification techniques are used to determine the causes of a given plant disease based on the characteristics of soil images and plant disease images. The findings are communicated to the growers through text messages sent to their mobile phones on a daily and seasonal basis, along with any potential recommendations for preventative actions. © 2023 Malque Publishing."
"The article is devoted to the analysis of the “Report about the official trip of the Minister of War to the Don Host Oblast in 1900” of A.N. Kuropatkin. This historical source is interesting because it is a personal narrative of the Minister of War of the Russian Empire, describing a trip to the Don Host Oblast in order to “understand the essence of the life of a Cossack”. Thus, it potentially makes it possible to understand the specifics of the views of the imperial government on the Don Cossacks at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries. However, until now, this text has been relatively little used by historians of the Cossacks (the studies of the Don Cossacks, carried out around the same time by A.N. Kuropatkin’s subordinates, generals P.O. Shcherbov-Nefedovich and N.A. Maslakovets, enjoy great authority). The article shows that this is not accidental. Research optics A.N. Kuropatkin was extremely specific: it is characterized by lack of system, inattention to some important aspects of the problem under study, unpreparedness for in-depth analysis and peremptory judgments. As a result, the minister's report demonstrates his detachment from reality and inability to understand the real problems of the Cossacks (for example, when inspecting the Don schools, he paid great attention to choral singing, but was not at all interested in more important things, such as the curriculum and the competence of teachers). Ultimately, the report of A.N. Kuropatkin clearly demonstrates why the imperial authorities failed to solve the problems of the Cossacks of the late imperial period: in their reform activities, imperial officials sometimes proceeded not from reality, but from a priori ideas about what the Cossacks should be like.

"Background: Women with overweight and obesity are at higher risk of developing complications in pregnancy such as gestational diabetes and longer-term chronic conditions. Research concerning health behavior change interventions during pregnancy and postpartum shows promising effects, but implementation into routine services is sparsely investigated. Most interventions focus on the antenatal or postpartum life stages, failing to meet the needs of women. IMPACT DIABETES Bump2Baby is a multicenter project across 4 high-income countries developed to test the implementation of an antenatal and postpartum evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) coaching intervention called Bump2Baby and Me (B2B&Me) designed to sit alongside usual care in the perinatal period. Objective: We aim to explore the feasibility and implementation of the B2B&Me intervention and investigate the effectiveness of this intervention in women at risk of gestational diabetes. Methods: IMPACT DIABETES Bump2Baby is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study, which integrates an evidence-based mHealth coaching app that includes personalized health behavior change coaching provided by health care professionals alongside antenatal care from the first antenatal visit to 12 months postpartum. The mHealth app offers the possibility of synchronous calls, asynchronous contact (including coach-participant text and video messaging exchanges tailored to the participant’s needs), and ongoing access to an extensive library of bespoke intervention materials. Participants will interact asynchronously with their health coach throughout the intervention via the app. This randomized controlled trial across 4 clinical sites within Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Australia will recruit 800 women in early pregnancy to evaluate the effectiveness on postpartum weight. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment implementation framework is the theoretical underpinning of the study. The implementation evaluation will be assessed at the individual, hospital staff, and broader community levels using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data sources for the RE-AIM evaluation will include app and platform analytics, screening and training records, participant medical records, key informant interviews, participant and partner exit interviews, cost data, study questionnaires, staff surveys, and blood sample analyses. Results: The study was approved and registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on November 19, 2020. Recruitment commenced on February 9, 2021, and data collection is ongoing. Publication of the results is expected in 2024. Conclusions: This is the first hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of an 18-month mHealth coaching intervention in at-risk women that we are aware of. As research aims to move toward real-world implementable solutions, it is critical that hybrid studies are conducted. The data from this large multicenter study will be useful in planning the potential implementation and scale-up of evidence-based perinatal health behavior change interventions. © 2023 JMIR Res Protoc 2023.

"This study examines the barriers to reading academic texts among university students for whom English is a foreign language. While many previous studies have focused on instructional design for building academic reading skills, this study focuses on the fundamental issues that need consideration before setting up the instructional design for English academic reading. Taking an interpretive phenomenological viewpoint, this study applied a qualitative method through an online survey and interviews. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, online data collection was the most accessible means of approaching the students. Ninety-five students from various non-English study programs (courses) at a private university voluntarily responded to the open-ended online questionnaire, providing survey data. Five students provided further data through individual interviews on their academic reading challenges. A thematic analysis of the survey data revealed four themes and eight subthemes representing the students’ challenges, which were explored further in the interviews. These challenges and the relationships among them are discussed. The results suggest that most students depended on single-word meanings as their prime strategy for achieving comprehension. However, this strategy also represented the most notable challenge in their effective reading of English academic texts. They failed to comprehend the text effectively because their translation did not make sense. Furthermore, the nature of the reading strategies of the student cohort had an impact on their baseline reading proficiency. © 2023, Syiah Kuala University. All rights reserved."
"At present, the text classification of power production safety hazards mainly relies on the traditional manual and empirical judgment. It is inefficient and cannot guarantee its correctness. To address these problems, a text feature extraction method based on Word2vec and convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed and combined with K-Means clustering algorithm to automatically classify power production safety hazard text. The method is based on the pre-trained Word2vec vectors and retrained based on its own text library of power production safety hazards. It combines the formal representation of low-dimensional vectors and the deep semantic features of the text, and finally clusters the text using a clustering algorithm. The experimental results show that the method can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of text classification.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Grammar errors are a natural part of everyday written communication. They are not a uniform group, but vary from morphological errors to ungrammatical word order and involve different types of word classes. In this study, we examine whether some types of naturally occurring errors attract more attention than others during reading, measured by detection rates. Data from 211 Danish high school students were included in the analysis. They each read texts containing different types of errors: syntactic errors (verb-third word order), morphological agreement errors (verb conjugations; gender mismatches in NPs) and orthographic errors. Participants were asked to underline all errors they detected while reading for comprehension. We examined whether there was a link between the type of errors that participants did not detect, the type of errors which they produce themselves (as measured in a subsequent grammar quiz), and the type of errors that are typical of high school students in general (based on error rates in a corpus). If an error is infrequent in production, it may cause a larger surprisal effect and be more attended to. For the three subtypes of grammar errors (V3 word order, verb errors, NP errors), corpus error rates predicted detection rates for most conditions. Yet, frequency was not the only possible explanation, as phonological similarity to the correct form is entangled with error frequency. Explicit grammatical awareness also played a role. The more correct answers participants had in the grammar tasks in the quiz, the more errors they detected. Finally, we found that the more annoyed with language errors participants reported to be, the more errors they detected. Our study did not measure eye movements, but the differences in error detection patterns point to shortcomings of existing eye-tracking models. Understanding the factors that govern attention and reaction to everyday grammar errors is crucial to developing robust eye-tracking processing models which can accommodate non-standard variation. Based on our results, we give our recommendations for current and future processing models. Copyright © 2023 Søby, Ishkhanyan and Kristensen."
"The poems included in the Rime secondo l’uso dei Siciliani antichi by Bernardino Baldi, published in the volume Lauro (Pavia 1600), linguistically and metrically imitate the forms and language of thirteenth-century Italian lyric poetry. By setting the poems within the sixteenth-century context of literary rediscov-eries of Italian poetical tradition, this article will focus on the analysis of those poems by Baldi that are canzoni (two of which are re-writings of texts by Giacomo da Lentini and Guittone d’Arezzo). This study will take into considerationthe phenomenon of the assimilation of archaisms and, conversely, that of the persistence of 16th-century literary forms in Baldi’s poems, in order to cast a new light on Baldi’s anti-classical poetic experiment. © 2023, SISMEL Edizioni del Galluzzo.

"Introduction: Hyperemesis gravidarum affects 0.3%–3% of pregnant women each year and is the leading cause of hospitalization in early pregnancy. Previous systematic reviews of available treatments have found a lack of consistent evidence, and few studies of high quality. Since 2016, no systematic review has been conducted and an up-to date review is requested. In a recent James Lind Alliance collaboration, it was clear that research on effective treatments is a high priority for both patients and clinicians. Material and methods: Searches without time limits were performed in the AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases until June 26, 2023. Studies published before October 1, 2014 were identified from the review by O'Donnell et al., 2016. Selection criteria were randomized clinical trials and non-randomized studies of interventions comparing treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum with another treatment or placebo. Outcome variables included were: degree of nausea; vomiting; inability to tolerate oral fluids or food; hospital treatment; health-related quality of life, small-for-gestational-age infant; and preterm birth. Abstracts and full texts were screened, and risk of bias of the studies was assessed independently by two authors. Synthesis without meta-analysis was performed, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. PROSPERO (CRD42022303150). Results: Twenty treatments were included in 25 studies with low or moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was very low for all treatments except for acupressure in addition to standard care, which showed a possible moderate decrease in nausea and vomiting, with low certainty of evidence. Conclusions: Several scientific knowledge gaps were identified. Studies on treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum are few, and the certainty of evidence for different treatments is either low or very low. To establish more robust evidence, it is essential to use validated scoring systems, the recently established diagnostic criteria, clear descriptions and measurements of core outcomes and to perform larger studies. © 2023 The Authors.

"Establishing consumers' views via text-based feedback in a questionnaire is crucial for organizations, include education, since it gives a summary of significant areas that help administrators plan, regulations, and decision making. Through surveys, academic organizations have gathered huge quantities of textual data all over the years. For the organization, it is still difficult to analyse the vast quantities of unstructured feedback from customers to understand their concerns and opinions generally. In this study, we propose deep learning (DL) based technique called topic modelling that utilizing Naive Bayesian (NB) to automatically summarize text and retrieve ideas from this raw data. Additionally, it discusses the text mining procedure used to extract relevant information from the vast volume of text-based data. The most significant issues obtained through feedback from customers were subsequently identified. The findings showed particular issues for workplaces, including environment, staffing, IT infrastructure, and customer feedback system. The feedbacks also prominently highlight difficulties with the attitude of student assistance and security staff as well as the library's management and operations. © 2023 Malque Publishing."
"The article analyses the text of the “Journey of the English Ambassadors to Rome in 1555” — a travel memoir compiled in the 1560s on the basis of a diary kept by Thomas North (1535 — c.1601), then a page in the household of ambassador Thomas Thirl-by, Bishop of Ely. Later in life, Thomas North became famous as the author of the first, often reprinted English translation of Plutarch’s “Parallel Lives” (1579), and his travelogue remains the most important of the extant documents related to the last English embassy to Rome (1555), which temporarily restored the country’s relationship with the Holy See. However, the “Journey” has been poorly studied and has never been looked at in the context of travel literature. Detailed analysis of North’s text shows that although the author followed the genre of medieval itineraries his work differs in focus and intent from other travel diaries and memoirs produced by English travelers and diplomats of the mid-16th century. North was not much interested in the political side of his journey, or even in the Roman antiquities. His text presents a series of the author’s impressions of what he saw in France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, of new palaces, fortresses, instruments, mechanisms and “wonders”: objects, animals and birds, and social practices. The unique combination of itinerary, diary and memoir in North’s “Journey” demonstrates how 16th century Europeans manipulated literary genres in search of a form suitable for describing their travel experiences and tastes. © A.

"Click-based echolocation can support mobility and orientation in people with vision impairments (VI) when used alongside other mobility methods. Only a small number of people with VI use click-based echolocation. Previous research about echolocation addresses the skill of echolocation per se to understand how echolocation works, and its brain basis. Our report is the first to address the question of professional practice for people with VI, i.e., a very different focus. VI professionals are well placed to affect how a person with VI might learn about, experience or use click-based echolocation. Thus, we here investigated if training in click-based echolocation for VI professionals might lead to a change in their professional practice. The training was delivered via 6-h workshops throughout the UK. It was free to attend, and people signed up via a publicly available website. We received follow-up feedback in the form of yes/no answers and free text comments. Yes/no answers showed that 98% of participants had changed their professional practice as a consequence of the training. Free text responses were analysed using content analysis, and we found that 32%, 11.7% and 46.6% of responses indicated a change in information processing, verbal influencing or instruction and practice, respectively. This attests to the potential of VI professionals to act as multipliers of training in click-based echolocation with the potential to improve the lives of people with VI. The training we evaluated here could feasibly be integrated into VI Rehabilitation or VI Habilitation training as implemented at higher education institutions (HEIs) or continuing professional development (CPD). 2023 Thaler, Di Gregorio and Foresteire."
"Objectives: This is a conceptual replication aiming to investigate the cognitive processes of students with reading comprehension difficulties using the think-aloud protocol. Methods: Among 72 third- and fourth-grade participants, 28 poor comprehenders and 44 average students were identified based on screening criteria and standardized tests. The thinkaloud protocol was used to monitor comprehension processes during reading. The participants verbalized their thoughts as they read expository and narrative texts. Those responses were transcribed and coded according to inference rates, correctness, and inferential types (explanation, prediction, or association). Results: First, poor comprehenders showed significantly lower rates and accuracies of inferences for both expository and narrative texts than average students did. Second, there were significant differences between poor comprehenders and average students in the proportions of the three types of inferences. Poor comprehenders generated significantly lower rates of explanatory, predictive, and associative inferences. Third, the inference types differed for different type of texts. Both groups made more predictive inferences when reading the narrative text than when reading the expository text. Conclusion: Differences in inference patterns between poor comprehenders and average students were identified using the think-aloud protocol. Different types of inferences were involved in processing different types of texts. Future research directions for developing learning strategies for encouraging solid inference are discussed. © 2023 Korean Academy of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology"
"""Ageing in place"" is the preferred choice for the majority of older persons in China, and community care services support them in living in their homes as long as possible. Based on statistics, interview data, and policy documents, this study analyses the provision and utilisation of community care facilities in Beijing by conducting spatial and qualitative analysis based on structuration theory. The mapping and spatial analysis reveal spatial inequity in the allocation of community care facilities in Beijing, which increased from 494 in 2017 to 1,201 in 2020. Communities in suburban areas, where the older population is growing the fastest, have poorer spatial accessibility to community care services than those located in the central city. Qualitative analysis based on interviews with 28 older residents in six communities, and six managers and staff members of community care facilities, revealed high demands for community care services including daily life support, emotional support, and healthcare services, with low utilisation of the services and many challenges for service provision. Poor perception and evaluation of the services by older persons result in low utilisation of the services. Financial difficulties in service provision and limited support from the government are the major challenges reported by the managers. Strategies have also been developed to meet these challenges by the older persons and managers. Text analysis of policy documents shows the development of regulations and policies on the construction, support, and quality management of the community care system. The complex dynamics of interaction between structure and agency in resource allocation and daily practice of service delivery shapes the provision and utilisation of community care services as a relatively new mode for aged care in China. The findings support understanding the challenges of community care service provision and utilisation from a health geography perspective. Joint efforts from local governments, communities, the private sector, and older residents are needed to support ageing in place in Beijing. © 2023 The Authors."
"Some commentators state that Marshall conceptualizes well-being primarily in terms of the consumer's and producer's surpluses, whose interdependence with moral character rests on the ability of markets to produce their effects on character spontaneously. The purpose of the present article is to show that evolutionary faith is not really enough to remove the tension between the economic and moral dimensions of Marshall's definition of well-being. Marshall understands that progress would not happen without assigning a special role to families and women in cultivating family affections as an essential means of harmonizing these two dimensions. To prove this point, the article examines several economic texts written before Marshall's major economic treatise, Principles of Economics, the first edition of which appeared in 1890. These texts have received little consideration in the existing literature about Marshall's treatment of the role of women in society.

"Umbrella clauses in bilateral investment treaties (BITs) can be named in various ways with differing scopes and effects depending on their texts. It is debatable whether a host state can be held liable based on an umbrella clause in a BIT if it breaches an investment commitment arising from the investment contract. There are two mainstream opinions in this debate: the restrictive and broad approaches. In our opinion, a case-specific approach should be adopted. In each case, the tribunal should act in conformity with the principle of competence-competence. During this analysis, the use of the general rule of interpretation (Art. 31) in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) should be considered. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"The purpose of this paper is to determine how COVID-19 shocks and government policies affected MSMEs’ financial and non-financial performance during the economic turmoil. The paper used both quantitative and qualitative methods. An online questionnaire survey was used to collect quantitative data from 380 Saudi MSMEs. The direct effects of the exogenous variables on the endogenous variable were determined using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Furthermore, multigroup analysis was used to examine the moderating effect of policy response on other variables. Interviews were conducted from a qualitative standpoint, and the information was converted into texts and qualitatively analyzed. Demand Shocks, Management/Operational Shocks, and Supply Shocks all have a significant impact on financial performance. The only significant predictor of non-financial performance was demand side shocks. Management/ operational side shocks, on the other hand, have no effect on the non-financial performance of MSMEs. Furthermore, policy response was found to be a powerful predictor of both financial and non-financial performance. During the COVID-19 outbreak, MSMEs’ policies and assistance programs had no discernible impact on demand and supply side shocks, as well as financial and non-financial performance. Overall, the findings of this study will help the Saudi government and other policymakers determine the best way to deal with current and future COVID-19 pandemics. © 2023, Small Business Institute.

"The author presents the arguments for the defining role of linguocultural studies at the present stage of the development of linguistics. It is noted that linguistics continues its search for the space of language studies in the light of integral human knowledge. Whereas structural approach views any language as an autonomous semiotic formation, “self-enclosed and self-supported”, as a rule, without taking into account extralinguistic aspects, which are studied in the framework of other humanities, anthropological approach is based on understanding language as a constitutive human property, as a part of humans’ daily living activities and their spiritual life. Linguistics has reached the point of studying language as an anthropological phenomenon and at this point solely linguistic analysis is not enough as it is insufficient to rely just on the traditional pattern including linguistics plus deep introspection or accidental, non-systematic knowledge taken from various humanities and sciences. It is suggested that anthropological “twist” in linguistics will let us overcome the long-running stage of spontaneous connection of the existing and potential linguistics. The article highlights the process of differentiation of linguistic approaches existing on the neighboring, but not identical, scientific platforms. At the same time the research conducted reveals the trend towards their convergence in the framework of the unified linguo-anthropological methodology. It is claimed that the defining role in this process belongs to linguocultural studies. The study deals with the basic principles of linguocultural approach. Various signs such as words, phraseological units and even the signs of the text size are used to identify the points of convergence between so similar, though not identical, branches — linguocultural studies and ethnolinguistics. The processes of interaction of mental structures and the language forms of their representation are explicated. Culturally marked signals in the semantics of language signs are identified and described. © 2023, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. All rights reserved."
"Host log contains rich semantic information, which is meaningful for cyber attack detection, cyber attack tracing and forensic. We propose a method that leverages the RoBERTa model to detect attack behavior. Our method models the problem of detecting cyber attacks based on host logs as a text classification problem in the field of natural language processing. The method involves constructing an activity graph to extract event sequences, which are then classified to identify attack. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on DARPA TC Program Engagement #3 dataset.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The aim of this article is to analyse the poetics of Antoni Malczewski’s Maria in terms of its cinematic qualities. The author uses various film theories, including those formulated by Siegfried Kracauer, Béla Balázs and Jean Mitry, in order to approximate the meaning of a text being cinematic and to find tools for the analysis of a literary text through this lens. Six features are distinguished: (1) fragmentariness of the plot structure, (2) editing within scenes, (3) a focus on movement, (4) transcending the limitations of human perception, (5) quasi-reproduction of reality and (6) giving images meaning as parts of a larger composition. These can be found in different passages from Maria, the analysis of which leads the author to conclude that the key to the cinematic qualities in Malczewski’s novel is the quasi-impersonal reproduction of reality achieved thanks to the withdrawn narrative perspective, the descriptions of empirical reality and the behavioural characteristics of the characters. In the summary, the cinematic qualities of Maria are put within a context of the history of literature and linked to the break with classicistic poetics and the move towards Romanticism. © The Author(s)."
"The log file can record the detailed operating information of the operating system and the running details of various service programs. Developers can use it to analyze system performance, check system exceptions and errors, and optimize the system at any time. Therefore, the importance of the log in the system's development and maintenance is unquestionable. However, with the increasing complexity of modern software systems, the log size is also increasing rapidly. Hence, traditional log analysis methods that rely mainly on manually customized regular expressions are not enough. A series of automated log analysis tools have emerged. This article designed a visual log analysis system called VLAS (Visual Log Analysis System). This paper first introduces log analysis's research status at home and abroad, as well as the evaluation of existing log analysis tools on various data sets, then briefly describes the relevant theories of log analysis. Then it introduces the design of the system from the overall architecture to the specific modules, and finally shows the functions that have been implemented in the system. VLAS can efficiently and quickly parse out structured log files and event template files that aggregate event statistics from the original log text. The structured log files are used for subsequent anomaly detection.The system implements three functions containing log parsing, anomaly detection and visual display. It integrates data processing and result analysis. Users can select appropriate algorithms according to the log data from different systems and get a better user experience.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: Racism exists in the healthcare system and is a root cause of health inequities among Indigenous Peoples. When microaggressions of racism are carried out by healthcare providers, therapeutic trust may be broken and quality of care may be impacted. Anti-racism response training is considered best practice in recognizing and addressing racism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a virtual (synchronous) anti-racism response training workshop among a group of rehabilitation therapists from across Canada. Methods: A 90-minute virtual anti-racism simulation workshop for rehabilitation therapists was developed and delivered virtually four times across Canada between 2020 and 2021. Following an introduction and pre-briefing, role-playing among participants was used to address microaggressive Indigenous-specific racism, followed by an in-depth debriefing with trained facilitators. A post-workshop survey was conducted to evaluate this anti-racism simulation workshop and assess the impact on participating occupational therapists (OTs) and physiotherapists (PTs). Following each simulation workshop, participants were invited to complete an anonymous post-activity survey (n = 20; 50% OTs, 45% PTs). Open text responses were analyzed thematically from the perspective of critical race theory. Results: The majority of the participants self-identified as women (95%); white (90%); mid-career (52%); and had never personally experienced racism (70%). All participants agreed that the workshop gave them ideas on how to start dismantling racism in their workplace. Thematic analysis resulted in four themes: so much to unlearn, remain humble, resist the silence, and discomfort is okay. Discussion: Despite feelings of discomfort, OTs and PTs appreciated anti-racism skills-based training and recognized the importance of taking action on racism in the workplace. Findings from this study support online (synchronous) anti-racism training as a viable and effective means of creating space for rehabilitation professionals to lean into brave conversations that are necessary for developing strategies to address racial microaggressions impacting Indigenous persons in the workplace. We believe that these small steps of preparing and practicing anti-racism strategies among rehabilitation therapists are essential to achieving a collective goal of dismantling racism in the health system. 2023 Fricke, Beach Ducharme, Beavis, Flett and Oosman."
"In university settings, writing argumentative essays from reading conflicting source texts is a common task for students. In performing this synthesis task, they must deal with conflicting claims about a controversial issue as they develop their own positions. Argumentative synthesis is characterized by writers’ back-and-forth moves between reading source texts and writing their own texts—a self-regulatory process that can be termed recursivity. The present study investigated the recursive behavior of Italian university students as they wrote argumentative syntheses while reading conflicting sources. The 43 graduate students participating in the study read four source texts on a controversial topic, evaluation in academe, with the goal of writing an argumentative essay. Reading of the sources was studied through a think-aloud procedure, and recursivity in writing the syntheses was recorded through Inputlog software. Comparisons were made between 22 high-recursive and 22 low recursive writers for the quality of their argumentative essays and for the critical strategies that they had used in reading the sources. Descriptive and nonparametic analyses produced the following three findings: (1) The strategies most employed in prereading were all related to synthesis-related activities: voicing opinion, expressing agreement, and expressing doubts. (2) Recursivity occurred most often in the middle of the synthesis process, as writers developed their arguments, instead of at the beginning or end. (3) High-recursive writers surpassed low-recursive writers by producing argumentative essays of higher quality and obtained better recall scores. They also employed more critical processing relevant to synthesis when reading the sources. This study provides insight on how recursivity is involved in argumentative writing but still there is need for further research. © 2023, The Author(s)."

"A handwritten book Collection of Military Letters is kept in the funds of the Russian National Library. It is a collection containing copies of messages about the military operations of parts of the Russian Army in 1702–1710. The study of the manuscript makes it possible to establish that the collection comes from the office of Boyar T. N. Streshnev and belonged to Clerk I. P. Topilsky. On the first pages of the collection, there is a previously unknown letter with a message about the assault and capture of the fortress of Nöteborg. An analysis of the letter demonstrates that its author was P. P. Shafirov, secretary of the Ambassadorial Prikaz. He was sent to Nöteborg to negotiate the conditions for surrendering the fortress. The letter contains information about the events of the assault, the course of negotiations, an assessment of the damage to the fortifications, and reports on the losses of the Russian side. Shafirov’s letter, written the day after the assault, is much longer than the known letters of Peter I but is not a work of the editors who created the official text of the report much later. The introduction of a new source about the assault and capture of Nöteborg adds to the knowledge about one of the significant events of the initial stage of the Northern War. © 2023 Ural Federal University.

"Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide, and early detection of gastric cancer is crucial to improving overall survival. Early gastric cancer screening prevents poor prognosis of gastric cancer through early diagnosis and early treatment, but requires high-quality endoscopy. We hope to improve the performance of early gastric cancer screening by using multimodal data in artificial intelligence-based systems. Therefore, we designed a multimodal fusion-based early gastric cancer screening framework that leverages both modal data, gastroscopic images and corresponding text, through multimodal bilinear fusion to improve performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"The dialogue summarization’s goal is to condense key information from complex dialogues into concise text, allowing users to browse through the content quickly. Unlike traditional text summarization, dialogue summarization data is characteristically lengthy and complex in structure.The traditional summarization model is unable to exploit the lengthy text information fully,and neglects the structural information of the conversation. To this end,this paper proposes a summarization generation method based on scene and dialogue structure by combining the extraction and generation model. This method generates the dialogue summarization using the scene,role,and dialogue content. Through dialogue analysis,a dialogue structure diagram incorporating elements such as roles,action descriptions,and conversations is constructed. The BERT pre-training model is fine-tuned using sequence tagging tasks to generate vector representation with dialogue sentences as the unit. Graph neural networks model the dialogue structure and filter out sentences containing key information. On this basis,the generation model uses the extracted results as the input. A Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) pre-training model as the basic framework, introduces additional role and scene information at the coding end,enriches the semantic features of the generation model,and uses the decoder with a multi-head attention mechanism to generate the summarization.The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can increase the ROUGE-1 index by up to 5.3 percentage points,compared to BART,MV_BART, HMNet,and other methods. © 2023, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

"Disinformation is a communicative phenomenon used in politics that is related to deception, with polarisation being one of its consequences. In order for misinformation to lead to polarisation, fear and insecurity are positioned as two important arguments, as they have the potential to reach the audience with great effectiveness. For this reason, this text analyses disinformation as a tool to encourage polarisation, studying the electoral political propaganda of the extreme right in Portugal and Spain. For this purpose, a rhetorical, semiotic and critical discourse analysis of Chega’s and Vox’s advertising graphics for the 2021 elections in Lisbon and Madrid, the two capitals of both countries, has been carried out. Results have been obtained in comparison, for example, the positioning of both parties as security providers. This strategy means that they present themselves as the only viable option for achieving the desired security and, in opposition, the others as insecurity and vulnerability. © 2023 Universidade da Beira Interior.

"Eating disorders represent a significant global health concern, characterized by high prevalence and profound repercussions for affected individuals. However, the timely identification of these disorders is impeded by the current reliance on time-consuming questionnaires as diagnostic tools. This article aims to outline the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based system designed to address this challenge. The methodology employed comprises three primary phases: a text preprocessing pipeline, topic extraction using BERTopic and the creation of binary classification and linear regression models based on fine-tuned BERT. These models enable the prediction of message origin from individuals with eating disorders and the estimation of the probability thereof. This comprehensive system facilitates the characterization and early detection of eating disorders within text messages. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"The paper aims to differentiate the combinable characteristics of “sustainable” and to streamline the transformation of its semantic structure in contemporary English. The availability of large online corpora provided a straightforward tool for analysis. The first step of the present work was to identify the collocational patterns for the keyword “sustainable,” then the frequency of all collocational pairs was found over the entire corpus; the collocations that occurred more than 20 times were considered to be important and included in the analyses. The concordances generated from text corpora were sorted according to their place—one to the right and two to the right to find any key factors or semantic fields. The data set was analyzed via SPSS 24. The factors identified in the “one to the right” group include “Energy facilities and solutions,” “Business and production,” and “Social development.” The factors in the “two to the right” group include “Human and social services,” “Earth resources exploitation,” and “Manufacturing and production.” © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Mental health is progressively reaching the attention of society because mental disorders provoke devastating consequences in the patients, their families and social circle. The preemptive detection of mental disorders, and in particular, depression disorders, may help its medical treatment. MentalRisk proposes three challenges related to the early detection of mental disorders. The SINAI team has participated in the task 2.a that consists in the detection of signals of depression in the Telegram messages of a set of users. We claim that the messages of people with depression have a relevant emotional burden. Accordingly, we follow a fine-tuning approach of the BETO Spanish language model pre-trained on a dataset of emotions. One of our submitted systems was reached the first position in the early detection of depression, and the fifth position according to an standard text classification evaluation. Hence, the use of emotional knowledge enhances the detection of depression. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) often requires both KG structural and textual information to be effective. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used to learn the textual information, usually under the fine-tune paradigm for the KGC task. However, the fine-tuned PLMs often overwhelmingly focus on the textual information and overlook structural knowledge. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes CSProm-KG (Conditional Soft Prompts for KGC) which maintains a balance between structural information and textual knowledge. CSProm-KG only tunes the parameters of Conditional Soft Prompts that are generated by the entities and relations representations. We verify the effectiveness of CSProm-KG on three popular static KGC benchmarks WN18RR, FB15K-237 and Wikidata5M, and two temporal KGC benchmarks ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15. CSProm-KG outperforms competitive baseline models and sets new state-of-the-art on these benchmarks. We conduct further analysis to show (i) the effectiveness of our proposed components, (ii) the efficiency of CSProm-KG, and (iii) the flexibility of CSProm-KG. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Although writing self-efficacy has been a productive line of research for several decades, no prior writing self-efficacy measure has focused on students’ self-efficacy for integrating information across multiple sources when producing an academic text. To fill this gap in existing research on the measurement of writing motivation, we designed a measure targeting the extent to which students are confident that they can write an academic text that integrates content from several different sources. In a study with Norwegian undergraduate students (n = 136), this measure, which we called the Multiple-Source based Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (MAWSES), was validated by means of confirmatory factor analysis and relationships between the resulting unitary construct and other relevant constructs. The findings provided evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the MAWSES. In future research, this measure could be included as an independent variable to predict processes and products of multiple-source based, integrated academic writing, as a moderator or mediator of effects in writing intervention research, or as an outcome variable in its own right.

"This article is a comprehensive empirical overview of environmental protection and conservation nonprofits’ discourse on social media. To what extent have these nonprofits framed climate change in their public discourse and how has it evolved over time? How do organizational characteristics and resources affect their social media behavior? To address our research questions, we use machine learning with texts—specifically topic modeling—to track the activity of 120 environmental nonprofits during a 14-year time span on X, formerly known as Twitter. Our analysis of more than 1.3 million tweets shows that climate change, although not closely aligned with the missions for more than half of the top tweeting organizations included in our sample, has consistently been a prevalent priority issue on their social media agendas for more than a decade. This heightened attention to climate change discourse by the environmental nonprofit sector denotes their uniform efforts to inspire government for climate action. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Power production safety hidden danger data is difficult to accurately identify, which leads to the inability to predict and prevent potential safety hazards. Moreover, the format of relevant laws and safety regulations in the power industry is different, and the original text information cannot be directly used for processing and analysis. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a preprocessing method for power production safety-related text information fusion cleaning. This paper proposes a feature mining method for power production safety hidden danger based on wavelet multi-window spectrum extraction.The crawling technology is used to crawl non-structured hidden danger data in the power production safety system, and NLP segmentation system is used to segment hidden danger texts. A database model is constructed to establish a high-quality sample data set with minimal cost and minimal sample deviation. The rough concept lattice generation algorithm is used for frequent access feature partitioning of data streams. And then, by constructing the wavelet function, the hyperbolic frequency mother wavelet of the hidden danger feature library of power production is obtained. The multi-window spectrum features of the database information flow are extracted to achieve feature mining of power production safety hidden dangers. Simulation results show that this method can effectively reflect the information characteristics of power safety hazard data and provide a basis for subsequent knowledge graph construction.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Stunting is a common nutritional problem in children. Many risk factors contributing to stunting are identified in the literature. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is useful for preventing impairment of fetal bone growth in the womb. However, lack of review in exploring supplementation of prenatal vitamin D is related to stunting in children. Purpose: This study aims to identify the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation in preventing stunting. Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial study, published between 2011–2023, a full-text article for pregnant women and an independent variable supplement vitamin D to prevent children’s stunting. The keywords used in English were “children OR child” AND “pregnant women” AND “preventive stunting” AND “vitamin D”. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool. Results: From the results of the study selection of 511 articles, 11 articles met the inclusion and eligibility criteria for study analysis. Four studies indicated that the administration of vitamin D did not influence the length of the neonate’s body or the Length for Age Z-Score (LAZ), used as an indicator of stunting. However, seven articles demonstrated that providing vitamin D supplements to pregnant women impacted various aspects of anthropometry, including the length of the neonate’s body. Our findings show that the dosage used of vitamin D in pregnancy varied between 1400–60,000 per week. Overall, results of this study analysis show that the intervention of prenatal vitamin D supplementation has an impact on the prevention of stunting. Conclusion: This literature review highlighted the benefits of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy and for the children’s growth. Prenatal vitamin D supplementation is needed to prevent stunting. © 2023 Sukmawati et al."
"Sentiment analysis (SA) has recently developed an automated approach for assessing sentiment, emotion, and these reviews or opinions to extract relevant and subjective information from text-based data. Analyzing sentiment on social networks, such as Twitter, has become a powerful means of learning about the users’ opinions and better understanding and satisfaction. However, it consumes time and energy to disperse and collect surveys from clients, often inaccurate and inconsistent, and evaluating and improving the accuracy of the methods in sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper uses NLP, text analysis, biometrics, and computational linguistics to detect and extract replies, moods, or emotions from Skytrax Airline Customers' Feedback SACF data. This research uses deep learning models to analyze various approaches applied to small SACF to solve sentiment analysis problems. We applied word embedding (Glove embedding models) to improve the sentiment classification performance of a series of datasets extensively utilized for feature extractions. Finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the SACF data analysis utilizing deep learning (DL)for evaluating the performance of the different models and input features, which is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CONV1D), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for application to big datasets in 2019. This approach was assessed using each classification technique; the precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics for sentiment analysis have been identified.

"Purpose: Signals of end-of-life decline observed in daily habits, such as mealtime participation, are important for moving towards comfort-focused goals of care in the final months of life of long-term care (LTC) residents. It is unclear how eating issues observed in real-time in LTC homes are used as indicators of suspected end of life. The study quantifies nutrition and key non-nutrition related signals (eg, general decline, unstable vitals) documented to describe end-of-life decline and the subsequent time to death. Patients and Methods: A retrospective chart review identified the first documented conversation where end-of-life decline was considered by members of the care team (eg, nurses, physicians, dietitian, family member) for 76 randomly selected decedents from 9 LTC homes in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Time (days) to death was calculated. A directed content analysis of the free-text description of the suspected end-of-life decline was used to categorize signals. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis tested the risk of mortality associated with each categorized signal. Results: Time to death of residents (mean age = 88 ± 7 years; 60% female) from the first documentation of potential end-of-life decline ranged from 0 days to over 2 years prior to death (median = 27.5 days). Seven nutrition-related and 18 non-nutrition related signals were identified. Swallowing difficulty (HR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.41, 6.33), cognitive decline (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.77), delirium (HR = 13.23; 95% CI = 1.57, 111.69), and cancer (HR = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.48) were associated with time to death. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the signals used by care providers in LTC to suspect that residents are declining towards the end of life and identifies four signals that were associated with time to death. When identified by care providers as indicators of end-of-life decline, swallowing difficulty and delirium predicted a shorter time to death, while cancer and cognitive decline predicted a longer time to death. Recognition of nutrition and non-nutrition related signals may be leveraged to systematically introduce timely comfort care conversations. Plain language summary: This study is part of a larger project exploring the experience of older adults living in residential long-term care (LTC) facilities around nutrition-related challenges (eg, refusing to eat, weight loss) in the final months of life. It is well known that residents experience more complex nutrition-related challenges with proximity to the end of life and that such challenges are associated with increased risk of death. Furthermore, LTC staff rely on observable signals, including nutrition-related challenges, to indicate that residents in their care are experiencing end-of-life decline and to reorient goals of care to emphasize comfort. As such, we carried out this study to identify how common nutrition-related challenges observed in residents may be leveraged to introduce comfort conversations between LTC staff, residents, and their family caregivers. To accomplish this, we performed an in-depth review of resident charts of 76 deceased LTC residents. In our review, we identified the point at which the LTC staff first noted a decline in the residents’ health that potentially indicated end-of-life decline. We took detailed notes of the circumstances surrounding the suspected decline and categorized the reasons given. Our study describes these documented reasons (ie, ‘signals’), which included seven nutrition-related challenges, only one of which (ie, swallowing difficulty) was associated with shorter time to death. From these findings, we can conclude that goals of care should be reassessed when LTC residents experience swallowing difficulty, while the other identified signals (eg, food refusal) may prompt LTC staff to initiate comfort-focused conversations despite uncertain imminence of death. © 2023 Morrison-Koechl et al."
"Depression is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by persistent sadness, lack of interest, and diminished pleasure. Detecting depression is crucial for timely intervention and support. In this paper, we address the task of depression detection in text data, focusing on binary classification and regression. We present our approach, leveraging a dataset comprising labeled messages from Telegram groups related to mental disorders. We begin by exploring the existing literature on depression detection, highlighting the challenges faced and the methods employed. Our approach involves data pre-processing, lexical feature extraction, phonesthemes embedding, and using the RoBERTa transformer model. We achieved promising results in the training phase through rigorous experimentation and model refinement. However, we encountered challenges upon evaluating our approach in the MentalRiskEs evaluation. We identified areas for improvement, particularly in latency and speed of detection for real-time monitoring of depression-related risks. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in automating depression detection and provides insights into the potential of text analysis techniques for mental health assessment. We remain committed to further enhancing our methodology and advancing the field to improve the well-being of individuals affected by depression. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"In short video communication, the user's emotional analysis is the basis of exploring the communication law of video media. The short video danmaku contains important information to analyze the user's emotional tendency. So identifying the emotional tendency of the audience via short video danmaku is significant for the video media communication. A novel prediction model for short video danmaku emotion recognition is designed. Firstly, the short video audience's emotions are divided into five categories to construct the user's emotional space. Then the video danmaku is preprocessed by shallow learning model. Then the preprocessed text vector generated by the preprocessor is input into Bi(LSTM+GRU)-Att model to extract high level features. Finally the shallow learning model completes the danmaku emotion recognition. The prediction model not only fully extracts the text and semantic features of the context, but also improves the model's interpretability. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy reaches 87.7% and the accuracy on the test set reaches 99.6%. Therefore this model has high accuracy in short video danmaku emotion recognition. The proposed model can be used as a basic tool for short video propagation mechanism analysis. © 2023 IEEE."
"Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) is an evidence-based treatment that uses environmental supports including signs, text messages, checklists, smart pill containers, and the organization of belongings to bypass cognitive and motivational impairments and to cue adaptive behavior in the home or work environment. We developed and tested a remote version of CAT to make the treatment available more broadly. Because CAT is focused on working with the individual in their home environment to establish supports, CAT may not be as easy to translate into an effective virtual treatment as talk-Therapies. Fifty-six members of managed care were assigned to or given their treatment preference for CAT or Remote CAT (R-CAT) for 6 months. In-person or virtual pill counts were conducted monthly and assessments of habit-formation, symptoms, functioning, and satisfaction were administered every 2 months by independent raters. Analyses using mixed models with repeated measures focused on pre-planned evaluations of within-group change. Adherence improved significantly in R-CAT, functioning improved significantly in CAT and both groups improved significantly on measures of habit-formation and symptoms across 6 months. Higher functioning individuals appeared to choose R-CAT. Satisfaction with treatment was very high in both groups. R-CAT appears to be a potentially effective treatment, particularly for medication follow-Though. However, in contrast to decades of previous research, fewer than 20% of eligible Medicaid recipients agreed to participate in the study. This may have been due to recruitment during and immediately post-pandemic.  © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Maryland's school of medicine, Maryland Psychiatric Research Center."
"The Routledge Handbook of CoFuturisms delivers a new, inclusive examination of science fiction, from close analyses of single texts to large-scale movements, providing readers with decolonized models of the future, including print, media, race, gender, and social justice. This comprehensive overview of the field explores representations of possible futures arising from non-Western cultures and ethnic histories that disrupt the “imperial gaze”. In four parts, The Routledge Handbook of CoFuturisms considers the look of futures from the margins, foregrounding the issues of Indigenous groups, racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities, and any people whose stakes in the global order of envisioning futures are generally constrained due to the mechanics of our contemporary world. The book extends current discussions in the area, looking at cutting-edge developments in the discipline of science fiction and diverse futurisms as a whole. Offering a dynamic mix of approaches and expansive perspectives, this volume will appeal to academics and researchers seeking to orient their own interventions into broader contexts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Taryne Jade Taylor, Isiah Lavender III, Grace L.

"The article examines the methodological problems of the historical-philosophical research of the “Soviet philosophy.” The process of the emancipation of thinking is examined through the analysis of the tradition of the Alushta Schools of Young Philosophers in 1987–1993. These schools played a historically significant role in overcoming the prejudices and stereotypes of the Soviet consciousness by the Ukrainian philosophical community. The mentioned analysis led to a few conclusions regarding the methodology of historical-philosophical research of the intellectual legacy – primarily texts – of the Soviet era. (1) Soviet philosophy was certainly an anti-philosophy, a social machine of anti-thinking. (2) The basis of analyzing both texts and events of this philosophy should consider the phenomenon of doublethink – two simultaneous and parallel spaces of discourses’ (meanings’) existence. Doublethink reflects the situation when ideological officialdom, loyalty to which was necessary, and the opposing desire for true thinking coexisted. (3) This collision led to the development of and was characterized by a number of features: the “Aesopian language,” peculiar regimes of private trust, intellectual reservations, etc. The article corroborates that the change in the dynamics of the intellectual situation (language of philosophy, mode of communication, communities of intellectuals, ethos and ideals of scientific research, etc.) is the main subject of historical-philosophical research. © С.

"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a rapidly expanding research field, making it difficult to keep up with all of its activities. It aims to examine people’s feelings about events and individuals as expressed in text reviews on social media platforms. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been the most successful in the past few years at dealing with sequence data for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These RNNs suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients and are inefficient at memorizing long or distant sequences. The recent attention strategy successfully addressed these issues in many NLP tasks. This paper aims to leverage the attention mechanism in improving the performance of the models in sentiment analysis on the sentence level. Vanilla RNN, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit models are used as a baseline to compare to the subsequent results. Then, an attention layer was added to the architecture blocks, where the encoder state reads and summarizes the sequential data. This layer provides weights to the summarized portion so that the decoder state can translate it more accurately and the model can make more accurate predictions. Under the same parameter settings, the integrated attention approach is evaluated and compared to the baseline models. The experimental results show that combining attention with these models can increase overall performance by a good margin in the suggested evaluation metrics compared to other works; it will help to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"Background Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have largely been incorporated into practice in high-income settings due to proven improvement in perioperative outcomes. We aimed to review the implementation of ERAS protocols and other perioperative optimisation strategies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and their impact on length of hospital stay (LOS). Methods We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Global Health (CABI), WHO Global Index Medicus, Index Medicus, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) for studies incorporating ERAS or other prehabilitation approaches in LMICs. We conducted a pooled analysis of LOS using a random-effects model to evaluate the impact of such programs. This systematic review was pre-registered on PROSPERO. Results We screened 1205 studies and included 70 for a full-text review; six were eligible for inclusion and five for quantitative analysis, two of which were randomised controlled trials. ERAS was compared to routine practice in all included studies, while none implemented prehabilitation or other preoperative optimisation strategies. Pooled analysis of 290 patients showed reduced LOS in the ERAS group with a standardised mean difference of -2.18 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -4.13, -.0.05, P < 0.01). The prediction interval was wide (95% CI = -7.85, 3.48) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94%). Conclusions Perioperative optimisation is feasible in LMICs and appears to reduce LOS, despite high levels of between-study heterogeneity. There is a need for high-quality data on perioperative practice in LMICs and supplementary qualitative analysis to further understand barriers to perioperative optimisation implementation.

"The process of selecting a supplier is a significant decision in supply chain management, as it can greatly impact the quality and cost of the procured products or services. This becomes even more important when shopping online, as there may be numerous options and thousands of reviews for a specific product type. In this research a novel hybrid methodology for supplier selection in e-commerce environment is introduced, which combines text mining and sentiment analysis of large customer review data and expert opinions of fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). Supplier selection requires expert perspective to determine the relevant criteria and assign them proper importance weights. Artificial intelligence is used to extract and interpret the emotional tone of customer reviews, adding valuable input to the determination of evaluation criteria and the rating of alternatives. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology, which is useful in situations with high levels of uncertainty or conflicting objectives and allows for the conversion of these qualitative expert opinions into a quantitative evaluation and determination of final criteria and their importance with the help of decision-makers' wisdom. By combining Artificial Intelligence techniques and MCDM approach, a more comprehensive and nuanced methodology to supplier selection is offered, taking into account both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the decision. As two different real-life case studies, office chairs and robot vacuum cleaners from Amazon.com, both characterized by a substantial number of customer reviews and various features, were selected. Users' perspectives on multiple product features were identified, allowing for informed decisions and the provision of feedback on potential product improvements. Remarkably, the proposed methods aligned with the star ratings provided by 40,000 Amazon customers, underscoring the reliability and validity of the method. The proposed approach stands out in the supplier selection field with its innovative combination of sentiment analyses of customer review and perspectives of the decision experts, offering a cutting-edge tool for e-commerce managers to select or evaluate suppliers in e-commerce environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"One of the most crucial components of information technology infrastructure in the modern world is cloud data centers. Customers have access to these data centers' infrastructure and software, which enable them to store and process massive amounts of data. However, the security and protection of private data in cloud data centers is a serious problem that needs effective and c solutions. Security and privacy issues exist because cloud computing outsources the processing of sensitive data. Consumer worries about cloud infrastructure security remain, particularly those related to data privacy. A thorough analysis of research efforts in the area of cloud security is the main objective of this study. In order to do this, a variety of models were evaluated, their advantages and disadvantages were identified, and a viable security solution based on symmetric algorithms was put forth. The original text in the proposed solution (Hybrid encryption algorithm) is first encrypted using the faster symmetric key method AES, and then its key is encrypted using the faster asymmetric key scheme RSA. This increases efficiency and speed. This method will shorten the time required for data encryption while enhancing its security. The final step was implementing the desired solution in the Eclipse software environment and comparing it against the Blowfish and RSA algorithms. The evaluation's findings indicate that the solution is more advantageous, which has resulted in a nearly two-fold decrease in execution time and a marked increase in throughput when compared to the RSA algorithm. Additionally, the execution time has shrunk, and throughput has been vastly improved compared to the Blowfish method. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization). All Rights Reserved."
"Space charge ellipsometry detection method provides an effective technical means to clarify the charge accumulation mechanism under transient stress, which can support the reliable assessment for the power electronic equipment insulation. In this article, the multisource signal transmission is constructed, which validates the feasibility of the measurement method from theoretical perspective. Meanwhile, the influencing factors of the measurement sensitivity are analyzed. The analysis and experiments show that there is a negative correlation between the measurement sensitivity with the substrate material elastic modulus and the sensor thickness. Then, the elastooptical sensor with micrometer thickness is designed. Although the structure influence of the millimeter-thickness sensor has been analyzed in the previous study, considering the large difference between micrometer and millimeter thicknesses, the micrometer-thickness sensor shape influence is further explored to avoid the influence of the size effect. It shows that as for the micrometer-thickness sensor, the refractive index variation of the hexagonal structure sensor shows a higher consistency with the applied elastic wave. Finally, the measurement reliability of the ellipsometry detection method is evaluated. The experiment finds that compared with the piezoelectric sensor, the ellipsometry detection method when using the sensor with micrometer-level thickness can achieve the tracking of the femtosecond pulsewidth elastic wave with less broadening of 1 ns and higher space charge measurement spatial resolution of $2~\mu \text{m}$. © 1963-2012 IEEE."
"Breastfeeding is recognised as a human right and in the UK, it is a legal requirement for employers to provide a space where breastfeeding mothers can rest. Despite this, breastfeeding rates in the UK are amongst the lowest in the world and breastfeeding mothers suffer prolonged loss of earnings compared to those who do not. In response, this study aimed to measure the attitudes to infant feeding among staff and students in a UK higher education institution and understand the experiences of those who have breastfed and/or expressed on campus. A convenience sampling technique was used to recruit 72 staff members and 99 students at the same UK university. Respondents completed an online questionnaire which first presented the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale and then provided an open text box where people who had experience of feeding on campus could share their experiences. Female respondents were more likely to prefer breastfeeding than men. Students were more likely to prefer breastfeeding than staff. However, raising breastfeeding awareness among both staff and students is required. A realist thematic analysis of the comments made by 17 staff members about their feeding experiences on campus identified a lack of consistency in terms of management and access to suitable facilities to either express milk or breastfeed. It is argued that a combination of education around breastfeeding, visual cues that breastfeeding is welcome, provision of suitable facilities and a clear breastfeeding policy that is consistently implemented is required to support breastfeeding on campus. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: Complex interactions between political economy factors and corporate power are increasingly recognized to prevent transformative policy action on non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention. System science offers promising methods for analysing such causal complexity. This study uses qualitative system dynamics methods to map the political economy of diet-related NCD (DR-NCD) prevention policy-making aiming to better understand the policy inertia observed in this area globally. Methods: We interviewed 25 key policy actors. We analysed the interviews using purposive text analysis (PTA). We developed individual then combined casual loop diagrams to generate a shared model representing the DR-NCD prevention policy-making system. Key variables/linkages identified from the literature were also included in the model. We validated the model in several steps including through stakeholder validation interviews. Results: We identified several inter-linked feedback processes related to political economy factors that may entrench different forms of corporate power (instrumental, structural, and discursive) in DR-NCD prevention policy-making in South Africa over time. We also identified a number of feedback processes that have the potential to limit corporate power in this setting. Conclusion: Using complex system methods can be useful for more deeply understanding DR-NCD policy inertia. It is also useful for identifying potential leverage points within the system which may shift the existing power dynamics to facilitate greater political commitment for healthy, equitable, and sustainable food system transformation. © 2023 The Author(s)."

"Text image machine translation (TIMT) aims at directly translating text in the source language embedded in images into the target language. Most existing systems follow the cascaded pipeline diagram from recognition to translation, which suffers from the problem of error propagation, parameter redundancy, and information reduction. The end-to-end model has the potential to alleviate these issues via bridging the recognition and translation models. However, the challenge is the data limitation and modality gap between text and image. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model, namely Modal contrastive learning based End-to-end Text Image Machine Translation (METIMT), which alleviates these issues through end-to-end text image machine translation architecture and modal contrastive learning. Specifically, an image encoder is designed to encode images into the same feature space of corresponding text sentences, with the guidance of an intramodal and inter-modal contrastive learning module. To further promote the research of text image machine translation, we have constructed one synthetic and two real-world datasets. Extensive experiments show that our lighter, faster model outperforms not only existing pipeline methods but also state-of-the-art end-to-end models on both synthetic and real-world evaluation sets. Our code and dataset will be released to the public. IEEE"
"Clouds play an important role in the Earth's climate system; however, various observational methods describe clouds differently, leading to cloud products being described with different characteristics, and affecting our understanding of cloud effects. To address this problem, this study integrates different cloud products into the transfer-learning procedure of a deep-learning model and determines the cloud effective radius (CER), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud top height (CTH) from Himawari-8 thermal infrared measurements. The retrieval results were independently evaluated against the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer science products and further compared with Himawari-8 operational products during the day. The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the model for the CER, COT, and CTH were $4.490~\mu \text{m}$ , 11.198, and 1.904 km, respectively, which are lower than those of Himawari-8 operational products (RMSE: $11.172~\mu \text{m}$ , 14.755, and 2.860 km). Moreover, validation results against active sensors show that the model performs slightly better during the day than at night, and both are generally better than the Himawari-8 operational product. Overall, the model maintains stable performance during both day and night, and its accuracy is higher than that of Himawari-8 operational products.  © 1980-2012 IEEE."
"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which involves four elements from user-generated texts: aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Most computational approaches focus on some of the ABSA sub-tasks such as tuple (aspect term, sentiment polarity) or triplet (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) extraction using either pipeline or joint modeling approaches. Recently, generative approaches have been proposed to extract all four elements as (one or more) quadruplets from text as a single task. In this work, we take a step further and propose a unified framework for solving ABSA, and the associated sub-tasks to improve the performance in few-shot scenarios. To this end, we fine-tune a T5 model with instructional prompts in a multi-task learning fashion covering all the sub-tasks, as well as the entire quadruple prediction task. In experiments with multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the proposed multi-task prompting approach brings performance boost (by absolute 8.29 F1) in the few-shot learning setting. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The paper offers an analysis of Quechua words and phrases used in reference to the Virgin Mary in four doctrinal works published between 1585 and 1631. The objective of the analysis is to determine the strategies of intercultural translation employed by the authors of the texts and to reconstruct the possible reception on the part of their intended audience. The analysis reveals that, apart from the formulae adapted from the European tradition, the authors drew the means of expression from precontact Andean religion and culture, especially from its ways of referencing religiously important female figures: the Quya and the female deities. This practice was most probably based on an assumption on the part of the authors that the connotations of Quechua words and phrases used by them corresponded to those which formed part of the established practice of Marian devotion in the Western Christendom. It enabled, however, a reading of the texts that construes a figure of Mary as analogous, perhaps even identical in some aspects, to female deities of the Andean religion. © The Author(s), 2023."
"OBJECTIVE: The aim: The purpose of the article is to identify the essence and causes of collective trauma and reveal its consequences for group identity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The authors used an interdisciplinary approach along with the principles of objectivity, tolerance, and impartiality. The analysis of the texts was conducted according to the basic principles of hermeneutics, namely the inexhaustibility of the authentic text and immanent critique. In addition, the method of conceptual and categorical analysis was applied, as well as induction, deduction, generalization, etc. The data collection was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar databases. Research papers were identified according to search terms: ""trauma"", ""traumatic experience"", ""collective trauma"", ""traumatization"", ""stress"", ""historical trauma"", ""defeat"", ""the Holocaust"", etc. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Collective trauma is a mental wound caused by the direct or indirect traumatic experience - a stressful situation that becomes a source of emo¬tional tension due to an unexpected threat to the life of a group of people. Collective trauma occurs, on the one hand, due to the awareness of helplessness in the face of danger and, on the other hand, due to the excessiveness of traumatic experience, which turns it into the eternal present and destroys identity. Historical traumas arise in the process of conscious exploitation of traumatic experience by political or other leaders in order to achieve emotional unity and group consolidation. Without appropriate processing, they can cause antisocial behavior of the traumatized persons that manifests in seeking revenge. Social partnership can help us to avoid the negative consequences of collective trauma and achieve social consensus."
"In this work, we have comprehensively investigated the degradation behaviors and mechanism of 1.2 kV silicon carbide (SiC) metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) under repetitive surge current stress. The experimental results show that the negative drift of threshold voltage (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\textit{V}_{\text{th}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) is related to the gate turn-off voltage and the surge current. The gate leakage current (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\textit{I}_{\text{gss}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) increases by about one order of magnitude after the stress. The deterioration of the electrical parameters is considered to be the gate oxide degradation associated with the increase of SiC/SiO<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> interface traps. By using the low-frequency noise (LFN) technique, it is demonstrated that the trap density of the device with the most severe degradation after the stress becomes 3.5 times the initial one. On the other hand, we observed that the voltage drop (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\textit{V}_{\text{sd}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) of the body diode and on-resistance (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\textit{R}_{\text{ds(\biosc{on})}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) increased.

"This work aims to introduce Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) under the Internet of Things (IoT) context to enhance the accuracy and granularity of sentiment analysis in animated online education texts. It employs a multimodal data collection approach and uses IoT technology to gather multimodal textual data from students engaged in animated online education. The data includes students' feedback texts, emotional texts, written texts, and verbal expressions during animated online education. Subsequently, a model named Information Block Bidirectional Long-Short term Memory (IB-BiLSTM) is designed and utilized to construct a sentiment classification model for animated online education texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an accuracy of 93.92% and an F1-score of 90.34% for sentiment classification in animated online education texts and the loss function converges to around 0.14. This model effectively captures the emotional changes and evolution during students' learning process. Thus, the proposed model holds significant potential and practical significance for enhancing animated online education's personalization and emotional engagement.

"Generating persona consistent dialogue response is important for developing an intelligent conversational agent. Recent works typically fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models on this task by concatenating persona texts and dialogue history as a single input sequence to generate the target response. While simple and effective, our analysis shows that this popular practice is seriously affected by Order Sensitivity where different input orders of persona sentences significantly impact the quality and consistency of generated response, resulting in severe performance fluctuations (i.e., 29.4% on GPT2 and 83.2% on BART). To mitigate the order sensitivity problem, we propose a model-agnostic framework, ORder Insensitive Generation (ORIG), which enables dialogue models to learn robust representation under different persona orders and improve the consistency of response generation. Experiments on Persona-Chat dataset justify the effectiveness and superiority of our method with two dominant pre-trained models (GPT2 and BART). © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In this paper, we propose a prediction method for shoot events using multimodal features. Soccer event prediction has conventionally been conducted based on statistical analysis by using an enormous quantity of tracking data. In contrast, with the development of the machine learning technology, an approach that uses advanced semantic information extracted from various data such as video, audio, and text has achieved high accuracy in many tasks of soccer analysis. Therefore, it is expected to improve the prediction performance of shoot events by cooperatively using multiple modalities instead of tracking data. Specifically, the proposed method predicts shoot events by considering spatio-temporal relations of a graph constructed based on audio and visual features extracted from soccer videos. Through the experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our method.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In his De gloria et gaudiis beatorum, printed in 1501, the clergyman Zaccaria Lilio explores a popular topic in the religious life of Renaissance Italy: what is heaven like and what kind of experience awaits the blessed there? And his answer represents a snapshot of a characteristic manner in which heaven was imagined in the period, both in written and visual form, one strongly focused on a sensory understanding of the afterlife and in which music played an important part. By identifying the sources of Lillio's interpretation of the sense of hearing in the afterlife, a network of clergymen interested in heavenly sensory delights is revealed, initiated by an Italian curiosity for a fourteenth-century text by a follower of Meister Eckart. This article aims not only to bring to the attention of scholars Lilio's neglected sensory treatise, but also to provide an in-depth analysis of the intricate connections between Italian authors of sensory treatises from the fifteenth century. The implications of this textual tradition disseminated through preaching are of great importance to the development of the image of heaven and its music in Renaissance Italy, for which the sensory perspective was of crucial importance. © 2023 The Authors.

"In this paper, we present the interim results of a transformer-based annotation pipeline for Ancient and Medieval Greek. As the texts in the Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams have not been normalised, they pose more challenges for manual and automatic annotation than Ancient Greek, normalised texts do. As a result, the existing annotation tools perform poorly. We compiled three data sets for the development of an automatic annotation tool and carried out an inter-annotator agreement study, with a promising agreement score. The experimental results show that our part-of-speech tagger yields accuracy scores that are almost 50 percentage points higher than the widely used rule-based system Morpheus.

"This letter presents a new approach to low-power, low-latency, and frequency-selective wake-up receivers. A novel architecture is introduced to achieve frequency domain selectivity, including analog techniques, that enable data detection without the need for power-hungry digital processing. A two-mode duty cycling is also utilized, which helps reduce the power consumption of the receiver significantly with negligible latency. A prototype of the proposed receiver is fabricated and verified in a 180-nm CMOS process. The fabricated chipset achieves a sensitivity of-84.9 dBm with 4.32-ms wake-up latency and drains an average current of 12.2 μ text A}. Interference tests show an outstanding signal-To-interference ratio (SIR) of-42/-49/-51 dB at 0.11%/0.22%/0.33% frequency offset from the carrier, confirming the interference immunity of the proposed design.  © 2018 IEEE."
"Text generative models trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) suffer from the notorious exposure bias problem, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are shown to have potential to tackle this problem. The existing language GANs adopt estimators, such as REINFORCE or continuous relaxations to model word probabilities. The inherent limitations of such estimators lead current models to rely on pretraining techniques (MLE pretraining or pretrained embeddings). Representation modeling methods (RMMs), which are free from those limitations, however, are seldomly explored because of their poor performance in previous attempts. Our analyses reveal that invalid sampling methods and unhealthy gradients are the main contributors to such unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present two techniques to tackle these problems: dropout sampling and fully normalized long short-term memory network (LSTM). Based on these two techniques, we propose InitialGAN whose parameters are randomly initialized in full. Besides, we introduce a new evaluation metric, least coverage rate (LCR), to better evaluate the quality of generated samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the InitialGAN outperforms both MLE and other compared models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a language GAN can outperform MLE without using any pretraining techniques. IEEE"
"In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal video captioning framework based on cross-modal fusion of visual and textual data. The proposed approach integrates a modality-attention module, which captures the visual-textual inter-model relationships using cross-correlation. Further, we integrate temporal attention into the features obtained from a 3D CNN to learn the contextual information in the video using task-oriented training. In addition, we incorporate an auxiliary task that employs a contrastive loss function to enhance the model's generalization capability and foster a deeper understanding of the inter-modal relationships and underlying semantics. The task involves comparing the multimodal representation of the video-transcript with the caption representation, facilitating improved performance and knowledge transfer within the model. Finally, a transformer architecture is used to effectively capture and encode the interdependencies between the text and video information using attention mechanisms. During the decoding phase, the transformer allows the model to attend to relevant elements in the encoded features, effectively capturing long-range dependencies and ultimately generating semantically meaningful captions. The experimental evaluation, carried out on the MSRVTT benchmark, validates the proposed methodology, which achieves BLEU4, ROUGE, and METEOR scores of 0.4408, 0.6291 and 0.3082, respectively. When compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach shows superior performance, with gains in performance ranging from 1.21% to 1.52% across the three metrics considered. © 2013 IEEE."

We evaluate both token classification and text classification settings for this problem, and compare performance of different pre-trained models including BETO, SpanBERTa, Multilingual Bert, and RoBERTuito. The results show that models achieve performance above 0.8 F1 for all types of cynical expressions in the text classification setting, but achieve lower performance (around 0.6-0.7 F1) for the harder token classification setting. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The goal of this work is the research and comparative analysis of the algorithms for text data classification in the context of solving the problem of validating medical news. The goal is achieved by considering different classification methods and identifying their advantages in solving this problem. The study considers the approaches to evaluating medical news using machine learning methods using different metrics. We describe the algorithm of partitioning data into collections with subsequent preprocessing and investigate a method for vectorizing the text to evaluate the significance of a word in a text document based on the data from the entire document dataset. In an experiment, we established the most efficient classification algorithm and made conclusions based on experimental results. © 2023 IEEE."
"Objective: Cardiovascular disease can be prevented through lifestyle changes, but such changes are often hard to attain. Text message interventions with lifestyle advice have shown small but promising effects. Our objective was to explore participant experience of a text message lifestyle intervention for patients with hypertension, and implications for future lifestyle interventions. Design and subjects: Fourteen participants were purposefully selected for telephone interviews after completion of a text message lifestyle intervention. A semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions was used. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The material was analyzed through systematic text condensation as described by Malterud, a data-driven analysis style that includes deductive elements. Setting: Primary care in three regions in southern Sweden. Results: The analysis resulted in three themes. ‘Blood pressure and lifestyle, how seriously to take it?’ revealed a remaining need for knowledge regarding to what extent lifestyle affects risk for cardiovascular disease. ‘The text messages–a useful reminder in need of tailoring’ described that the design of the intervention was satisfactory, but suggested improvements through increased individualization. Finally, ‘Water off a duck’s back or a kick in the pants–when does behavior change?’ showed how some participants responded to the push to change while others did not, supplying material for further analysis in a framework of behavioral change theory. Conclusion: A key to adoption was advice that was applicable in daily life. Timing in relation to a diagnosis of hypertension or other motivational factors, and tailoring to prior knowledge, habits, and limitations could increase effectiveness. © 2023 The Author(s).

"This study proposes a comprehensive measure of Euroscepticism through textual analysis of parliamentary speeches. This innovative approach offers direct insights into politicians' attitudes towards European integration, enabling quantification of the intensity of Eurosceptic sentiments. We leverage advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including supervised classification and transfer learning. The objectives of this research are three-fold: A) to introduce a novel method for measuring Euroscepticism using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, b) to compare the predictive performance of these various techniques for the task at hand, and c) to mitigate, to the extent possible, the inherent difficulties and limitations of crowdsourced data annotation when the process requires expert knowledge. Results indicate that in the absence of a humanly curated annotated dataset, GPT outperforms other approaches (F1 score 0.74). On the contrary, when such a dataset exists, Few-Shot classification proves to be the optimal solution (F1 0.87). These findings pave the way for a more accurate assessment of Euroscepticism and potentially other political phenomena, through the innovative use of NLP techniques.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Structural and semantic linguistics has accumulated colossal experience in the systematization of language units, the relationships between them, has formed a unified view of the language as a complex system. Cognitive and discursive paradigm in linguistics has made it possible to explain linguistic and speech characteristics with the context and attracted the cognitive nature of the linguistic sign as a full-fledged component of analysis. Transferring the idea of anthropocentrism to the figure of the second participant in communication, it came to the conclusion that the last component plays large role in the communicative interaction between addresser — text — addressee, and that the interpretive potential of the text depends on the cognitive abilities of this addressee and his discursive baggage. In the/given article the listed characteristics of the state of modern linguistics made it possible to try to identify an interdependent relationship between the structural and semantic characteristics of language units selected by the author of a literary text from the arsenal of the language and woven into its syntagmatics, and the cognitive and discursive «subtext» that linguistics extracts from the text, which helps expose the author’s intentions more clearly. The material for the analysis made fragments of works by the classical Russian literature authors (I.A. Bunin, I.A. Goncharov, M.M. Prishvin, A.P. Chekhov), structural and semantic analysis was used as a leading method, supplemented with elements of content and discourse analysis. The novelty of the research lies in the desire to make a linguistic analysis of the speech canvas of a literary text in the context of new explanatory «horizons» that have opened up due to the cognitive-discursive paradigm. The study of the linguistic «details» of specific fragments of literary texts has shown that the interpretation of a literary text is based on the characteristics of linguistic units (morphemes, words, word forms, syntactic constructions, CSI, etc.) described in detail within the framework of the structural and semantic paradigm, expanding the view of the contextual environment (in this case — already broad context) allows introduce into the interpretation arguments that depend on the interpreter’s own reading and within his value system. © 2023, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia.

"The essay studies the forms of Tasso’s canzone belonging to the encomiastic genre, focusing on the large corpus collected in the Seconda parte delle Rime published by the author in 1593. After briefly recalling the importance of this selection within Tasso’s immense lyric production, and the philological problems still connected to it, it proposes a reading in series of its canzoni and an analysis of some recurring and characteristic figures. The careful strategies of variation that preside over the choice and arrangement of the texts are thus brought to light: the collection appears almost as a repertoire of models for the various forms of encomium adaptable to the noble metre of Petrarch’s canzone. © 2023, SISMEL Edizioni del Galluzzo.

"This study explores professionals’ construction of their multifaceted identities as representatives of their corporations in business writing. The self-mention framework is applied to explore the representation of the “business-self” which I propose encompasses the projection of individual, collective, and corporate identities. A corpus of 100 CEO's letter to shareholders was examined for the use of personal pronouns and company referential terms and collocation analysis performed to understand the surrounding discourse contexts. The findings reveal a distinct hierarchy of identities; US business professionals communicate with stakeholders by immersing themselves in the identity of the collective and make a concerted effort to project the corporate identity, whereas representation of the individual self is minimal. The study provides important insights into the identity construction work undertaken by professionals in authentic business texts and the findings can help inform English for Specific Purposes (ESP) practitioners of business communication courses in higher education. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Bernd Frohmann's investigations have been relevant to the field of information science and related disciplines, addressing topics such as enunciation/discourse, institutionality, dispositives, networks, agency, documentary practices, actors, associations, policies, information regimes, and materiality. These themes are shaped, in terms of materiality, through the stabilization of statements in documents or ""quasi-objects"" that circulate and generate social effects. Therefore, the objective is to analyze the concept of materiality in Frohmann, considering institutional, epistemological, and political implications. Literature review was conducted, including Frohmann's publications from 1992 to 2008, as well as analysis of texts that utilize that theoretical framework. The analysis is based on the assumptions of documentary ontology, whereby documentation is guided by the interplay of document properties, motivations, and agency effects. Within these assumptions, materiality serves as a heuristic resource. The publications offer a distinct overview of documentation studies, differentiating from positivist, functionalist, and/or mentalist approaches. When addressing the materiality of information, Frohmann is primarily interested in the processes it undergoes, such as how the document, as a sociotechnical object and means of materiality stabilization, generates effects in specific contexts with social, epistemological, political, and ethical implications. © 2023 Facultad de Filosofia, UNED.

"Fluorescent-guided surgery using indocyanine green (ICG) is a rapidly expanding surgical technology, but its application in pediatrics remains unknown. Authors represent a descrip-tive analysis of the current applications of ICG in pediatric surgery based on a systematic bibliographical review on this topic. Material and methods used: the study searched articles in 3 major scientific databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and eLIBRARY.RU) published after 2000 for the keywords as follows: fluorescent-guided surgery, indocyanine green, ICG navigation, children. Two researchers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the primary search to avoid discrepancies. Results: initial database search yielded 762 titles. After the exclusion, 25 full-text publications were included in the generalization. Most studies were conducted in Italy (n=6) and the UK (n=6) followed in descending order by North America (n=5), Japan (n=4), Spain (n=2) and China (n=2). The distribution by time of publication was as follows: 2019 – 3, 2020 – 2; 2021 – 8; 2022 – 12. A systematic review includes 396 surgical interventions performed on pediatric patients using ICG. The most frequently performed surgical procedure in childhood was the Palomo varicocelectomy (66). This is followed by: abdominal tumors – 59, esophageal anastomosis – 53, renal cyst and duplication – 38, chest tumors – 37, ovarian tumors – 28, cholecystectomy – 26, kidney tumors – 24, liver tumors – 19, identification aortocoronary fistulas – 16. Most often, the drug was administered during the operation – 15 publications, 1 day before the operation – 9 publications, immediately before the operation – a single publication. The methods of administration were distributed as follows: intravenous – 21, intraluminal – 2, intraorgan – 1, intratesticular – 1. Dosing of the drug depends on the method of application of ICG and the area of its application. Most often, the drug was used intravenously in dosages from 0.1 to 0.75 mg/kg. For tumors, increased doses of the drug were used from 1.5 mg/kg for tumors of the abdominal cavity to 2 mg/kg for hyperinsulinism. Insufficient visualization of anatomical objects was only reported in 3 cases. Information about the side effects of the introduction of ICG in the body of a child is scarce and is represented by only 2 mentions of cardiac arrest and desaturation, which both ended safely. Conclusion: current trends demonstrate that fluorescent-guided surgery has become commercially available and is increasingly being used among pediatric surgeons to treat a wide range of diseases, including hepatobiliary surgery, oncology, urology, cardiac and vascular surgery, and is also used to assess blood flow in operated organs of a patient. © 2023, Pediatria Ltd.

"The text presented exposes the semiotic analysis of advertising of the product of the “Cervecería de Mexicali”, a company that emerged in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, during the UnitedStates prohibition era in the year 1923. To carry out the analysis, three systems of interacting signs named as: Socio-geographic, visual culture, economic-productive were distinguished. The distinction of these systems offers us an interpretation of the visual communication that the company proposed at the time in the border region of northwestern Mexico, in such a way that sense can be given to selection of visual elements and strategies in relation to the public or market can be deduced which was addressed during that period. © 2023 The Author(s)."

"Sentiment analysis is one of the hot research topics in natural language processing, aiming to analyze the subjective sentiment expressed in text through inductive reasoning. Common deep learning-based sentiment classification models often require the integration of word embedding techniques. However, conventional approaches to generating word embeddings struggle to effectively capture the bidirectional semantic features of text. RoBERTa, with its unique attention mechanism and masked technique, enables the capture of more comprehensive features in the text. In this paper, we introduce the RoBERTa model to the task of Chinese comments sentiment classification and address the limited data issue by employing data augmentation methods to expand the dataset. Through a series of experiments conducted on three different datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the sentiment classification model that combines RoBERTa with data augmentation methods. © 2023 IEEE."
"Multimodal sentiment analysis encompasses modalities beyond text, including visual and audio data, enabling combinations of two or three modalities. It has diverse applications in domains like virtual assistants, YouTube movie reviews, news videos, and emotion recognition, including depression monitoring. Sentiment analysis involves extracting opinions from public discourse to enhance various operations. In this paper, using the Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) dataset, which consists of video, audio, and text data, for the sentimental analysis of multimodal data is proposed. One of the significant challenges in this analysis is accurately determining the sentiment (optimistic or pessimistic) when the data is presented in the form of a tone. The proposed technique analyzes sentiments by focusing on audio and text data. Feature extraction is performed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) for audio and Word2vec for text. These extracted characteristics are combined using hierarchical fusion and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is employed to obtain bottleneck features. Experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 62.45% for audio data, 73% for text data, and 76.09% for the fusion of audio and text using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Using data describing all “Top 5” economics journal publications from 1969 to 2018, we examine what determines which authors produce less as they age and which retire earlier. Sub-field has no impact on the rate of production, but interacts with it to alter retirement probabilities. A positive, tentative, and contemporary writing style increases persistence in publishing. Authors whose previous work was more heavily cited produce slightly more. Those better-cited with more top-flight publications retire later than others. Declining publication with age arises mostly from habit—there is a very significant increasing positive autocorrelation of publication across the decades of a career. © 2023 Western Economic Association International."
"Though acoustic speech emotion recognition has been studied for a while, bimodal speech emotion recognition using both acoustic and text has gained momentum since speech emotion recognition doesn't only involve the acoustic modality. However, there is less review work on the available bimodal speech emotion recognition (SER) research. The review works available mostly concentrate on the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, recent deep learning techniques like attention mechanisms and fusion strategies have shaped the bimodal SER research without explicit analysis of their significance when used singly or in combination with the traditional deep learning techniques. We therefore, review the recently published literature that involves these deep learning techniques in this paper to ascertain the current trends and challenges of bimodal SER research that have hampered it to be fully deployed in the natural environment for off-the-shelf SER applications. In addition, we carried out experiments to ascertain the optimal combination of acoustic features and the significance of the attention mechanisms and their combination with the traditional deep learning techniques. We propose a multi-technique model called the deep learning-based multi-learning model for emotion recognition (DBMER) that operates with multi-learning capabilities of CNNs, RNNs, and multi-head attention mechanisms. We noted that attention mechanisms play a pivotal role in the performance of bimodal dyadic SER systems. However, few publicly available datasets, the difficulty in acquisition of bimodal SER data, cross-corpus and multilingual studies remain open problems in bimodal SER research. Our experiments on the proposed DBMER model showed that though each of the deep learning techniques benefits the task, the results are more accurate and robust when they are used in careful combination with multi-level fusion approaches.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Textual adversarial attacks expose the vulnerabilities of text classifiers and can be used to improve their robustness. Previous context-aware attack models suffer from several limitations. They generally rely on out-of-date substitutes, solely consider the gold label probability, and use the greedy search when generating adversarial examples, often limiting the attack efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose <bold>MC-PDBS</bold>, a <bold>M</bold>ore <bold>C</bold>ontext-aware textual adversarial attack model using <bold>P</bold>robability <bold>D</bold>ifference-guided <bold>B</bold>eam <bold>S</bold>earch. MC-PDBS generates substitutes using the newest perturbed text sequences in each attack iteration, enabling the generation of more context-aware adversarial examples. The probability difference is an overall consideration of the probabilities of all class labels, which is more effective than the gold label probability in guiding the selection of attack paths. In addition, the beam search enables MC-PDBS to search attack paths from multiple search channels, thereby avoiding the limited search space problem. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that MC-PDBS outperforms previous best models in a series of evaluation metrics, particularly bringing up to a +19.5&#x0025; attack success rate. Extensive analyses further confirm the effectiveness of MC-PDBS. IEEE"
"Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher &#x201C;credibility&#x201D; than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (RDCM) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model. IEEE"
"The management of a mental health of a person has been made possible in recent years by a variety of virtual assistants. This paper uses a Rule-based Chatbot to provide a quick description of a mental state of a human. An AI-powered computer programme known as a Chatbot can mimic human interaction via voice commands, text dialogues, or a combination of the two. This AI function, also referred to as a Rule-based Chatbot, can be included in and used with well-known messaging platforms. The natural language toolkit is used in the implementation of this Chatbot. Natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI, is used by Chatbot powered by AI to improve the user experience. These NLP-based Chatbot, also known as virtual agents or intelligent virtual assistants, support human agents by managing time-consuming and repetitive exchanges. Human agents can now concentrate on instances that require their knowledge because they are more complex. NLP-based Chatbot are intelligent in that they can understand speech patterns, text structures, and language semantics. Because of this, they can analyze and derive meaning from massive amounts of unstructured data. A Chatbot has the capacity to perceive small differences in different languages which is improved by cross-linguistic comprehension of morphemes of Natural Language Processing(NLP). In addition, NLP gives Chatbot the capacity to comprehend unused words, adjust to changing abbreviations, and identify emotions through sentiment analysis, simulating human-like comprehension. This model depicts a Chatbot that responds to user inquiries in a brief and straightforward manner. Although conversational AI is frequently associated with Chatbot, not all Chatbot use AI. In general, rules-based Chatbot are used to describe Chatbot that do not use AI. These Chatbot direct users towards particular behaviours using established rules and decision trees. These scripts and rules are predetermined, and any changes call for manual action from the organization. One of the early alternative therapies explored was cognitive behavioural therapy. The user must, however, attend face-to-face counseling, which could last nine to twelve years. The first virtual assistant designed in 1950 to read a person's mental state was the Turing test. The main goal of this proposed system is to overcome the difficulties in determining the appropriate responses to the user's inquiries. Performance metrics such as Similarity Bow and Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score is used to evaluate the similarity between the exact answer and predicted answer. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

"This article is an analysis of two autobiographical texts by famous Polish painters of the turn of the century: Julian Fałat’s Pamiętniki (Diaries) from 1935 and Wojciech Kossak’s Wspomnienia (Reminiscences) from 1913. These texts constitute a source of information not only about the life of Polish artists at the imperial court in Berlin, but also a treasury of historical knowledge about the moods prevailing in the Wilhelmine era, the Polish–German relations in particular. In both texts, the most important figure is that of the German emperor, his involvement in the affairs of art and concern for the fate of outstanding Polish painters. The analysed texts allowed, above all, for showing the difficulties in Polish–German relations at the turn of the century, the ambivalence of the German emperor in relation to the Polish issue and individual Poles, and the difficulties of Polish artists in maintaining the balance between being the court painter of the German emperor and a Polish patriot. © 2023 Poznanskie Studia Polonistyczne.

"Bridging traditional experts’ disciplinary boundaries is important for nuclear knowledge management systems. However, expert competences are often described in unstructured texts and require substantial human effort to link related competences across disciplines. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a natural language processing approach, based on Latent Semantic Analysis, to enable the automatic linking of related competences across different disciplines and communities of practice. With datasets of unstructured texts as input training data, our results show that the algorithm can readily identify nuclear domain-specific semantic links between words and concepts. We discuss how our results can be utilized to generate a quantitative network of links between competences across disciplines, thus acting as an enabler for identifying and bridging communities of practice, in nuclear and beyond. © 2023 Korean Nuclear Society"
"Introduction. Due to the dynamic development of modern imaging technologies in recent years, much attention has been paid to radiomics particularly texture analysis.

"In this article, we propose a new floating layer embedded drift design engineering to enhance the static Baliga&#x2019;s figure of merit (BFOM) of the GaN Schottky barrier diode (SBD) by modulating the electric field profile. Introducing a novel step graded double-layered p-GaN floating island (FI) inside the drift region boosts the breakdown voltage (BV) of GaN-SBD from 2078 to 2426 V without any noticeable ON performance degradation. The design parameters of FIs are systematically optimized to obtain the optimal BFOM using Silvaco TCAD. The maximum BFOM of 8.22 GW/cm<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> can be obtained, representing a notable 34.8% improvement compared to conventional single-layered FI GaN SBD.

"This study is devoted to the analysis of lexico-semantic group of verbs, which express attitude to someone in Russian and the ways of their translation into Chinese. A group of emotional and evaluative verbs included in the lexico-semantic field of interpersonal relations is analyzed. The choice of the study material is determined by the fact that this group of verbs is one of the most frequent in the use and widely represented in the novel “Crime and punishment” by F.M. Dostoyevsky, occurring 561 times. The significance of this research lies in the absence of a special systematic study of this lexico-semantic group on the material of literature in Russian and Chinese languages, as well as in the need to develop a comprehensive research methodology, methods of comparative and contextual analyses. The study reveals the semantic features of verbs in the Russian and Chinese languages. It is established that the lexico-semantic group under study consists of verbs that are perceived as categorical-lexical semes “relation” and can have both positive and negative semantic meaning. The semes ‘positive attitude’, ‘love’, ‘faith’, ‘respect’, ‘compassion’, ‘pity’ and ‘negative attitude’, ‘suffering’, ‘doubt’, ‘fear’ are subjected to study. These features determine the structure of the group in question in the lexical and semantic system of the Russian and Chinese languages, are expanding the understanding of the content and structure of the group of verbs. The result of the study is that the analysis of interlingual gaps reveals the presence of incomplete lexical correspondence to a foreign language word. The analyzed linguistic material made it possible to identify similarities and differences in the semantics of verbs when translating the text of the novel into Chinese. © Li Xiuyu, Rybinok Ev.S., 2023."
"Language transforms experience into meaning. Grammar, which can be metaphorically construed as its powerhouse, enables such a transformation. One of the linguistic approaches utilised to understand the linkage between the semiotic and material world is Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). SFL argues that the experiential meaning of a clause can be investigated through its transitivity structures in terms of Process, Participant, and Circumstance. This study carries out a transitivity analysis of expressions shared by COVID-19 survivors from different parts of the world in an attempt to learn how they construe their experience of illness. The data were obtained from online newspapers published in different countries and conveniently developed into a corpus from which COVID-19 survivors’ expressions were extracted. All texts under examination were reported in English regardless of their original language. This study examines the survivors’ direct expressions through their transitivity structures using the SFL framework. The results show that these individuals frequently used relational and abstract material Processes in describing their illness, meaning that they tended to express their physical or psychological experiences metaphorically as beings and actions. This suggests that they abstractly construe their experiences with this viral disease. Constructing experiences abstractly is likely driven by the need to distance themselves from experience as a way of coping with an event perceived as potentially life-threatening. © 2023, Syiah Kuala University.

"Camera-captured document images usually suffer from various appearance degradations, which hamper the clarity of content and preclude subsequent analysis and recognition systems. Most existing methods are tailored for one or relatively few degradations, making them feasible only in limited scenarios. However, in real-world applications, degradations are more diverse, and different degradations may arise simultaneously in a single image. To remedy this limitation, we aimed to achieve appearance enhancement for camera-captured document images in the wild, where degradations exhibit more diversity and may coexist simultaneously within the same image. To realize this, we propose a new end-to-end neural network called GCDRNet, which consists of two cascaded subnets, GC-Net and DR-Net. The GC-Net is used for global context modeling, and the DR- Net is used for detail restoration through a multi-scale and multi-loss training strategy. To train and validate GCDRNet in real-world scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark called RealDAE, which contains 600 real-world degraded document images that are carefully annotated with pixel-wise alignment. To the best of our knowledge, RealDAE is the first dataset that targets multiple degradations in the wild. Extensive experiments validated the superiority and advancement of our GCDRNet and RealDAE compared to existing methods and datasets, respectively. In addition, experiments also demonstrated that image appearance enhancement as a pre-processing procedure can effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as text detection and recognition.

"Sentiment analysis holds significant importance in research projects by providing valuable insights into public opinions. However, the majority of sentiment analysis studies focus on the English language, leaving a gap in research for other low-resourced languages or regional languages, e.g., Persian, Pashto, and Urdu. Moreover, computational linguists face the challenge of developing lexical resources for these languages. In light of this, this paper presents a deep learning-based approach for Urdu Text Sentiment Analysis (USA-BERT), leveraging Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and introduces an Urdu Dataset for Sentiment Analysis-23 (UDSA-23). USA-BERT first preprocesses the Urdu reviews by exploiting BERT-Tokenizer. Second, it creates BERT embeddings for each Urdu review. Third, given the BERT embeddings, it fine-tunes a deep learning classifier (BERT). Finally, it employs the Pareto principle on two datasets (the state-of-the-art (UCSA-21) and UDSA-23) to assess USA-BERT. The assessment results demonstrate that USA-BERT significantly surpasses the existing methods by improving the accuracy and f-measure up to 26.09% and 25.87%, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The accuracy of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been significantly improved with the development of deep learning and Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT. However, their large number of parameters and computations pose deployment challenges. For instance, while using BERT can improve predictions in financial sentiment analysis (FSA) tasks, it can also slow down processing, where throughput and accuracy are equally important for profitability. To address these issues, we first propose an efficient and lightweight BERT model called ELBERT, which incorporates a novel confidence-window-based (CWB) early exit mechanism. In addition, an innovative approach is proposed to accelerate text processing on the GPU platform, which addresses the challenge of effectively deploying the early exit mechanism with large input batch sizes. Using these advancements, we develop a fast and high-accuracy FSA system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CWB early exit mechanism outperforms existing early exit methods on BERT in terms of accuracy, at the same computation cost. By leveraging this acceleration method, our FSA system can boost the processing throughput by nearly 40 times, enabling it to process over 1000 texts per second with sufficient accuracy. This processing rate is nearly twice as fast as FastBERT, providing modern trading systems with a more powerful text processing capability. © 1991-2012 IEEE."

"Technological advancements have now allowed each one of us to learn new skills at home or through various workshops conducted, and as proof, certificates are provided for each learned skill. Nowadays, certificates, whether digital or handwritten, are provided in image format. We can use this information to provide analysis on which subject has recently gained popularity and how to improve the field of study at different universities. Therefore, this paper proposes distributed incremental clustering with closeness factor-based algorithm (DIC2FBA) for text clustering. The primary focus is on the faculty development program certificates dataset, which covers both textual and numeric data. The proposed system used AWS EC2 instance and AWS S3 bucket, which helps to cluster data from multiple sites in iterative and incremental mode. Further, we have compared the findings achieved using the DIC2FBA with K-means modified inter and intra clustering (KM-I2C) algorithm based on silhouette score, and Davis Bouldin index. The proposed system will help educational institutions understand the popular skill set of faculties which can further be used to understand the effectiveness of such programs. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"Background and Objectives: Emerging expert consensuses and guidelines recommend that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-inflammatory effects in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, these recommendations are based on pathophysiological studies of inflammation rather than direct clinical evidence. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods and Study Design: We retrieved literature from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Cochrane Library databases up to May 1, 2023. Data from studies comparing omega-3 fatty acids with a placebo or other pharmaceutical nutrients were analyzed. Results: Of 3032 records, 42 full-text articles were reviewed, five eligible studies were identified, and one study was found in the references. In total of six studies involving 273 patients were included, pooled, and analyzed. Compared to the control group, omega-3 fatty acid intervention reduced the overall mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (RR=0.76; 95% CI, [0.61, 0.93]; p=0.010). No serious or unexpected drug-related adverse events were observed. No statistical significance was observed in inflammatory markers such as CRP (MD=-9.69; 95% CI, [-22.52, 3.15]; p=0.14; I2=97%) and IL-6; however, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was significantly lower in the omega-3 FAs group on day 7 of intervention (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Omega-3 fatty acid administration may be associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Given the small sample size of enrolled studies, more rigorous and large-scale trials are urgently needed in the future to verify its efficacy. © (2023). All Rights Reserved."
"This article proposes a Weibo sentiment analysis method to improve traditional algorithms' analysis efficiency and accuracy. The proposed algorithm uses deep learning in the Spark big data environment. First, the input data are converted into dynamic word vector representations using the Chinese version of the XLNet model. Then, dual-channel feature extraction is performed on the data using TextCNN and BiLSTM. The proposed algorithm uses an attention mechanism to allocate computing resources efficiently and realizes feature fusion and data classification. Comparative experiments are conducted on two public datasets under identical experimental conditions. In the NLPCC2014 and NLPCC2015 datasets, the proposed model improves the precision and F1 metrics by at least 4.26% and 2.64%, respectively. In the weibo_senti_100k dataset, the proposed model improves the precision and F1 metrics by at least 4.66% and 2.69%, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed method has better sentiment analysis and prediction abilities than existing methods. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved."

"With the continuous popularization of medical informatization, the number of medical documents, medical guides, electronic medical records and other medical texts shows a trend of rapid growth and huge scale. Medical texts contain great social value. However, most medical texts exist in an unstructured form and cannot be directly applied to products. Therefore, how to fully explore the potential valuable information has become a hot research direction in the field of natural language processing. Named entity recognition is the basic task of natural language processing, and also the key task of medical data mining and analysis. It also lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as medical term relationship extraction and medical term standardization. Named entity recognition aims to find some key phrases in a large number of texts, such as people's names, place names, diseases and drugs. At present, named entity recognition has made great achievements in the open field, but there are still many problems in the research of named entity recognition in the medical field, such as the strong professionalism of entities, the long length of some types of entities, and the existence of complex entities mixed in Chinese and English. Aiming at the problem that the length of named entities in existing medical electronic medical records is longer than that in other fields, resulting in low extraction accuracy, a named entity recognition algorithm based on boundary enhancement is proposed. The model adopts the method of multi-task learning, which can effectively alleviate the boundary problem caused by the length of medical terms. We have tried various models on our medical electronic medical record data set. Experimental results show that this method is simple and effective in medical named entity recognition. © 2023 IEEE."
"This article presents a novel subharmonic super-regenerative receiver (SHSRR) radar for high-sensitivity and low-noise operation in beyond-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$f_\text{max}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) applications. In contrast to conventional super-regenerative designs, the proposed concept is extended by an inherently implemented, subharmonic downconversion. This downconversion allows a tripling of both operation frequency and bandwidth and thereby enables the system&#x2019;s operation beyond its gain limit. Operated with the novel SHSRR, the maximum operating frequency and bandwidth of FMCW transceivers is proven to be significantly increased. With local oscillator (LO) power requirements considerably reduced compared with passive mixer approaches, the concept is also suited for massive multichannel scaling. Optimized modulation signals are applied to the SHSRR concept, which intentionally boost the receiver&#x2019;s nonlinearity and thus substantially improve previously achieved intermodulation efficiencies for the first time. The concept is verified experimentally with a 24-GHz FMCW radar transceiver implemented in planar microstrip technology. Due to the introduced optimization approach, extremely high sensitivity levels of well below <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$-114$</tex-math> </inline-formula> dBm have been accomplished, whereby the previously achieved noise figure is improved from almost 30 dB down to 11 dB. Power consumption was limited to 9 mW. This simple, novel concept is thus suitable for scaling to integrated circuits with a high number of receive channels at several 100-GHz carrier frequencies.

"A numeration system encodes abstract numeric quantities as concrete strings of written characters. The numeration systems used by modern scripts tend to be precise and unambiguous, but this was not so for the ancient and partially-deciphered proto-Elamite (PE) script, where written numerals can have up to four distinct readings depending on the system that is used to read them. We consider the task of disambiguating between these readings in order to determine the values of the numeric quantities recorded in this corpus. We algorithmically extract a list of possible readings for each PE numeral notation, and contribute two disambiguation techniques based on structural properties of the original documents and classifiers learned with the bootstrapping algorithm. We also contribute a test set for evaluating disambiguation techniques, as well as a novel approach to cautious rule selection for bootstrapped classifiers. Our analysis confirms existing intuitions about this script and reveals previously-unknown correlations between tablet content and numeral magnitude. This work is crucial to understanding and deciphering PE, as the corpus is heavily accounting-focused and contains many more numeric tokens than tokens of text. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Recent pre-trained language models (PLMs) equipped with foundation reasoning skills have shown remarkable performance on downstream complex tasks. However, the significant structure reasoning skill has been rarely studied, which involves modeling implicit structure information within the text and performing explicit logical reasoning over them to deduce the conclusion. This paper proposes a unified learning framework that combines explicit structure reasoning and language pre-training to endow PLMs with the structure reasoning skill. It first identifies several elementary structures within contexts to construct structured queries and performs step-by-step reasoning along the queries to identify the answer entity. The fusion of textual semantics and structure reasoning is achieved by using contextual representations learned by PLMs to initialize the representation space of structures, and performing stepwise reasoning on this semantic representation space. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks involving diverse structures, and shows transferability to downstream tasks with limited training data and effectiveness for complex reasoning of KGs modality.

"The process of integration in the Eurasian region is important for all states and after the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Russia’s greater Eurasian policy and the expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the conditions for integration have become more suitable than before. After a decade and a half of observer membership, Iran has finally become an official member of SCO in 2022, and it seems that due to the wide territorial contiguity from the borders of Türkiye to Afghanistan, new possibilities for regional integration have been created. This article is written with the aim of discussing Iran’s role in Eurasian integration after the membership in the SCO. The main question in this article is that how Iran can contribute to Eurasian regional integration within the framework of this organization? The author’s idea is that Iran’s membership in the SCO, through the increasing expansion of the connections of the Eurasian region to South Asia and the Middle East, provides more opportunities for cooperation in confronting the sources of regional insecurity, cooperation in the field of trade and the expansion of regional transport and communications and this issue can contribute to economic development, security and broader regional integration in the region. The author has tried to use the theory of regional integration and the method of qualitative content analysis of documents, texts, reports and news related to the Eurasian integration to verify the hypothesis. The findings of this research show that the greater Eurasian region needs a wider integration in the fields of economy, trade, communication and transportation, and the solution to reduce its problems is possible through the cooperation of all effective regional actors, and Iran is also one of the effective countries that has been a missing linkage in Eurasian integration and any comprehensive security and economic integration in Eurasia requires its active participation, which an official member of the SCO has created this opportunity. © Karami J., 2023."
"In the present time, social network applications like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have evolved as a popular way of information sharing for general users. On these platforms, valuable information appears as breaking hot news, trending topics, public opinion, and so on. Twitter is the most popular microblogging service that generates huge volumes of data with high velocity and variety (i.e., images, text and video). Due to the growth of discussed real-world events over Twitter, the event detection problem is becoming an interesting and challenging issue. Event detection is the practice of applying natural language processing and text analysis techniques to identify and extract event information from text. This survey paper explores important research works for event detection using Twitter data. We classify approaches according to feature modelling methods: vector space model, statistical model and graph model. We highlight research challenges, issues, and the limitation of existing approaches to find the research gaps for future directions. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"Autobiographies are about selves, and one can reasonably expect that in writing an autobiography the authorial subject is making a claim of personal significance, and is, in the text, engaging in self-assertion and self-display. Might one not then question whether an autobiography which strives to portray the autobiographical subject’s selflessness could be effective? This is an important issue in relation to Albert Luthuli’s Let My People Go (1962) since it typically foregrounds politico-historical analysis, in keeping with the narrative’s evident the didactic intent, and diminishes focus on the autobiographical subject. The autobiography depicts an autobiographical narrator and subject who embrace humility and the ideal of selflessness. Luthuli’s narrator ensures that readers know that he is not laying claim to his own importance, and he does this in part by adopting strategies such as reminding readers of the exemplary shape of his experience and his lack of ambition in relation to his political career. Furthermore, Luthuli is reticent about his private life and personal relationships. Nonetheless, Let My People Go is effective as autobiography; this is because–not in spite of–of its portrayal of the autobiographical subject’s selfless self. In this article I make a case for renewed attention to Luthuli’s autobiography and argue that readers learn a great deal about the autobiographical subject–and his ethical values–through the narrator’s refusal to engage in self-display. © 2023 The Editorial Board, Current Writing."
"The study is relevant due to the needs of studying promotional discourse in terms of effective use of linguistic means for product and service promotion in a competitive market. The aim of this study is to study the stylistic and communicative features of headlines in promotional discourse in the English language. The research material included 2092 headlines from 115 automobile brochures (44 car brands). The research methods include discourse analysis, linguocognitive categorization by semantic and functional criteria, quantitative analysis, and cognitive mapping. As a result of the study, it was found that the headlines contained a wide range of stylistic devices. The most numerous are lexical means — hyperbole, metaphor, epithet, personification, idioms, metonymy, repetition, incorporation, and blends. The figures of speech based on syntactic means — hyperbole, comparison, antithesis, parceling, parallelism, emphasis, inversion, framing, anaphora, chiasm, and pun — occurred less frequently. However, considering the syntactic organization of the headlines with the predicative, imperative, gerundial, attributive and interrogative structures, syntactic means were found dominant due to their wider functionality. Among phonetic devices, alliteration prevailed. The communicative techniques included customization, text navigation, storytelling, informative facts and issues related to driving. The majority of the headlines epitomized a synthesis of various stylistic means whose classification was fulfilled only for the purposes of the linguistic research. The headline length varied within 1–23 words (average 5, median 4, STD 2.75); standard being concise, while creative — more extended. Thematically, the headlines accentuated comfort, emotional commitment to the brands, engine capacity and their low footprint. The obtained results could be used in the practice of teaching English for specific purposes to students specializing in marketing, advertising and public relations. © Filyasova Yu.A., 2023."
"The discipline of Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), which is expanding quickly, intends to automatically create summaries of enormous amounts of text so that readers can save time and effort. ATS is a rapidly growing field that aims to save readers time and effort by automatically generating summaries of large volumes of text. In recent years, significant advancements have been witnessed in this area, accompanied by challenges that have spurred extensive research. The proliferation of textual data has sparked substantial interest in ATS, which is thoroughly examined in this survey study. Researchers have been refining ATS techniques since the 1950s, primarily categorized as extractive, abstractive, or hybrid approaches. In the extractive approach, key sentences are extracted from the source document(s) and combined to form the summary, while the abstractive approach employs an intermediary representation of the input document(s) to generate a summary that may differ from the original text. Hybrid approaches combine elements of both extractive and abstractive methods. Despite various recommended methodologies, the generated summaries still exhibit noticeable differences compared to those created by humans. This research survey offers an inclusive exploration of ATS, covering its challenges, types, classifications, approaches, applications, methods, implementations, processing and preprocessing techniques, linguistic analysis, datasets, and evaluation measures, catering to the needs of researchers in the field. © 2013 IEEE."

"Animal welfare protection is a challenge for which policy-makers are demanding scientific-based evidence. Considering horses, the challenge is even greater, as their role in society varies from production to companion animals. This review aimed to describe the evolution and geographical distribution of horse welfare literature over the years, to identify the most studied research topics and to highlight the still present gaps in knowledge. A search on Scopus® bibliometric database was performed using different welfare-related keywords. Predetermined filters were posed on time range, language and subject area. A total of 6584 records were downloaded and screened retaining only the ones dealing with horse welfare and behavioural sciences. Descriptive statistics, text mining (TM) and topic analysis (TA) were performed on the abstract of 801 eligible records. The results showed the number of studies on horse welfare is exponentially increasing, especially in the European continent. ‘Transport’ was the most frequent word, but also ‘behaviour’ and ‘pain’ emerged. Nine topics were identified and covered different subject areas: stress analysis, pain assessment, equitation science, human–horse interactions, breeding management, transport, working equids and health. The evaluation of stress and pain, horse social behaviour and the human–horse relationship resulted to be the most studied aspects related to animal welfare. On the contrary, the concept of positive welfare and the welfare assessment at slaughter of horses were underrepresented, confirming the limited literature on these subjects. This review confirmed the growing impact of research on horse welfare and highlighted how some important areas still do not provide sufficient scientific evidence. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Rumor detection has been the focus of public opinion analysis and a topical area of in natural language processing research. Rumor detection which uses the deep learning method mainly extracts features such as rumor text, users information and communication structure, and determines rumors by inputting a suitable rumor detection model and using trained classifiers. In this work, a rumor detection model called BGLA is proposed, it merges the propagation structure and content features, the extracted feature vectors and adjacency matrix are passed through the BiGCN model to obtain the causal characteristics of rumor propagation along the relational chain from top to bottom, and the structural features obtained by bottom-up aggregation, the characteristics of the propagation and dispersion of rumors are simulated respectively. Then the BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism is added to obtain the temporal characteristics of the text, while allowing the model to focus more on the part of the input sequence that is relevant to the current prediction, and finally the event labels are calculated after the fully connected and softmax layers.

"Background: Professional health organizations recommend that outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs include activities to optimize the physical, mental, and social well-being of patients. The study objectives were to describe among cardiac rehabilitation programs (1) mental health assessments performed; (2) psychosocial services offered; and (3) leadership's perception of barriers to psychosocial services offerings. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of North Carolina licensed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs on their 2018 services was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey responses. Thematic analysis of free text questions related to barriers to programmatic establishment or expansion of psychosocial services was performed by two team members until consensus was reached. Results: Sixty-eight programs (89%) responded to the survey. Forty-eight programs (70%) indicated offering psychosocial services; however, a majority (73%) of programs reported not directly billing for those services. At program enrollment, mental health was assessed in 94% of programs of which 92% repeated the assessment at discharge. Depression was assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire by a majority (75%) of programs. Psychosocial services included individual counseling (59%), counseling referrals (49%), and educational classes (29%). Directors reported lack of internal resources (92%) and patient beliefs (45%) as the top barriers to including or expanding psychosocial services at their facilities. Conclusions: Cardiac rehabilitation programs routinely assess mental health but lack the resources to establish or expand psychosocial services. Interventions aimed at improving patient education and reducing stigma of mental health are important public health opportunities. 2023 Bush, Evenson, Aylward, Cyr and Kucharska-Newton."
"In this article, we present a novel approach for representing text as fixed-length semantic vectors. Building upon previous research, we propose a modified method that combines key phrase extraction techniques with clustering techniques to generate concept-based, low-dimensional directed representations of documents. To evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting vectors, we conducted experiments using them in an aggregation task against a set of robust baselines following a similar approach. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed modification significantly enhances the quality of the vector representation of documents. Specifically, the assembly accuracy improved by at least 3% on the V1 scale, validating the efficacy of our approach. This research contributes to the field of natural language processing by offering an efficient method for representing text as semantic vectors, thereby enabling more accurate and comprehensive analysis of textual data. © 2023 IEEE."
"The AI tool ChatGPT has shaken the academic system and challenges conventional teaching-learning methods. Using a mixed method approach, the author adopted a task-based analysis to measure the Library and Information Science (LIS) students’ academic performance and integrity during the Artificial Intelligence, especially the ChatGPT trend. A group of 32 LIS final-year students were purposively selected as they completed all the basic courses of their discipline. A one-day session was divided into two phases–a written exam and an assignment through ChatGPT–held at the Institute of Information Sciences (IIS), Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU). Both examinations were administered using a questionnaire including a series of 15 tasks. A faculty member of IIS was tasked with reviewing the gathered answer scripts voluntarily. Results showed that it is too difficult to rank students’ positions based on ChatGPT-generated tasks, as the participant who placed in 20th position (scored 5 out of 30) among 32 in the written examination, placed in 2nd position (scored 25) in ChatGPT-generated assignment. It is encouraging that the similarity indices (by Turnitin) reached up to 89%, which is unacceptable under university regulations. However, none of these assignments included in-text citations and references, which is questionable from the standpoint of academic ethics. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government of Indonesia (GoI) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) celebrated its 18th anniversary in 2023. However, its discursive aspect and efficacy are still under-researched. This article aims to analyze the process types in the Helsinki MoU text and explore the policy implementation of the agreement on the social changes in Aceh. The MoU document was retrieved from the United Nations peacemakers’ website. Mixed methods with descriptive statistics were used to identify, interpret, and explain the data. Hallidayan systemic linguistics was employed to identify the process types and the transitivity patterns. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) as an explanatory critique was applied to critical social analysis. The findings show that the material processes dominated the Helsinki MoU text (73%), followed by the relational processes (18%), and verbal processes (4%). The actors were generally in the form of concepts and sometimes obfuscated. Meanwhile, the goals were also mostly realized by concepts. Explanatory critique reveals that there was a vagueness and hidden power relation between the GoI and GAM in the peace deal. The GoI has also been inconsistent with some of the agendas. The Helsinki MoU has yet to produce comprehensive outcomes for Aceh’s development and has seemingly served as a bureaucratic means of control. The current study has limited itself to the single MoU text. Therefore, for deeper inquiries further research should focus on multiple similar texts and use a different research design, including intertextuality, questionnaires, and interviews. © 2023, Syiah Kuala University.

"Introduction: Official documentation of specialty training provides comprehensive and elaborate criteria to assess residents. These criteria are commonly described in terms of competency roles and entrustable professional activities (EPA’s), but they may also implicitly encompass virtues. Virtues are desirable personal qualities that enable a person, in this case, a medical specialist, to make and act on the right decisions. We articulate these virtues and explore the resulting implied ideal of a medical professional. Method: We applied a two-staged virtue ethical content analysis to analyze documents, specific to the Dutch training program of the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialty. First, we identified explicit references to virtues. Next, we articulated implicit virtues through interpretation. The results were categorized into cardinal, intellectual, moral, and professional virtues. Results: Thirty virtues were identified in the ENT-training program. Amongst them, practical wisdom, temperance, and commitment. Furthermore, integrity, curiosity, flexibility, attentiveness, trustworthiness and calmness are often implicitly assumed. Notable findings are the emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness. Together, these virtues depict an ideal of a future medical specialist. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that competency-frameworks and EPA’s implicitly appeal to virtues and articulate a specific ideal surgeon. Explicit attention for virtue development and discussion of the role and relevance of implied ideal professionals in terms of virtues could further improve specialty training. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Effects of impact ionization on hard switching in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are studied by 2-D analysis where undoped semi-insulating buffer including deep-donor traps is assumed.

"Recent development in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques has encouraged NLP-based application in various field including business, legal and health. An important process for all NLP projects is text preprocessing which is a process that modifies text data before using them in a machine learning model. Usually text preprocessing process includes cleaning, filtering, removing and replacing some texts to increase model accuracy, robustness, reduce data size or preserve privacy. Named entities recognizer (NER) is an NLP tool which finds Named Entities in text such as: names, organization, addresses, numbers and date. In this work, we create a preproccessing approach that uses NER to find named entities and, then, replace them with their type i.e. location, person or organization name to improve accuracy and preserve privacy instead of removing them or letting them become noise to our data. Experiments for text classification task using our approach have been conducted on several datasets some of which were collected in-house. Experiments indicate that using this approach enhances classifier accuracy and reduces feature representation's dimensionality while, also, preserve privacy.  © 2023 The Authors."
"Finding a relationship between events and mining particular event types between events are the two objectives of the event correlation identification work. The approach put out in this research is capable of processing and analyzing the structured text representation content of events, such as control and monitoring on the Internet of Things, and it can also carry out Event Correlation Analysis in Collaborative Processes in Industrialization Scenarios. Previous studies mostly dealt with unstructured text data and employed techniques like event extraction, relation extraction, and deep learning models for correlation analysis. Since the data in this study is structured and categorized by different event kinds, it is challenging to utilize a deep learning model to directly analyze the relationships between events. Therefore, this paper first constructs a data set of character behavior characteristics (GKD-BehaviorData) and proposes a general event representation method. Then, based on the previous research on case reasoning and machine learning, a hybrid computing method (Hybrid-Composition&Embedding Method, H-CE) based on event composition features and knowledge embedding is proposed. The results of the studies show that this method is noticeably superior to the event correlation calculation method based on event correlation characteristics, with improvements in the acc and F1 values of 17.4% and 19.7%, respectively. © 2023 IEEE."
"The rapid development of science and technology has dramatically increased the requirements for refrigeration technology in the temperature range from −190 $$^\circ {\text{C}}$$ to −50 $$^\circ {\text{C}}$$, such as biomedical science, clean energy and aerospace engineering. Mixed-refrigerant Joule-Thomson (MRJT) refrigeration technology has distinct advantages in this temperature range. The system efficiency deteriorates with the decrease of refrigeration temperature, especially at the temperature below −150 $$^\circ {\text{C}}$$. Precooling can effectively reduce the temperature span of the main refrigeration system and improve the system efficiency. This paper presents a low temperature refrigeration cycle coupled with a precooling system to produce the temperature below −150 $$^\circ {\text{C}}$$. A mathematical model based on the energy and exergy methods was established to evaluate the system performances at varied operation conditions. The results indicated that the precooling system can significantly improve the refrigeration efficiency. At the precooling temperature of −40 ℃, −50 ℃, −60 ℃, and the main cycle target temperature of −180 ℃ to −150 ℃, the composition and working pressure of the R170/R600a binary mixture in the precooling cycle and the N2/R14/Methane/Ethane quaternary mixture in the main cycle were optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). Under the optimal working conditions, the cooling capacity, power consumption, exergy are analyzed. The results obtained in this paper are of great significance to the performance analysis and optimal design of low-temperature refrigerator. © Zhejiang University Press. 2023."
"The study focuses on the use of proper names in the articles of four Czech writers: Jan Neruda (1834–1891), Svatopluk Čech (1846–1908), Karel Čapek (1890–1938), and Karel Poláček (1892–1945), who reflected not only Czech culture and society, but also the Czech language. Given their avid interest in linguistics, the aim of this paper is to analyze the authors’ linguistic takes on proper names as reflected in their art journalism (essays, feuilletons, and columns). The present analysis focuses on their opinions of, for instance, naming of public spaces, personal names (and whether they use them stereotypically), misuse of proper names in politics, and naming in advertising. Their attitudes towards the naming strategy (seen as a linguistic strategy) are always examined in the context of the dominating linguistic views of the given period (the views on the language norms in particular), from approximately the 1850s until the 1930s. This approach, combined with a literary-cultural one, allows us to cover the issue comprehensively. The study is based on the chapter of the forthcoming dissertation Language and linguistic issues and their reflection in the works of selected Czech writers. © 2023, Czech Academy of Sciences.

"Research in medical visual question answering (MVQA) can contribute to the development of computer-aided diagnosis. MVQA is a task that aims to predict accurate and convincing answers based on given medical images and associated natural language questions. This task requires extracting medical knowledge-rich feature content and making fine-grained understandings of them. Therefore, constructing an effective feature extraction and understanding scheme are keys to modeling. Existing MVQA question extraction schemes mainly focus on word information, ignoring medical information in the text, such as medical concepts and domain-specific terms. Meanwhile, some visual and textual feature understanding schemes cannot effectively capture the correlation between regions and keywords for reasonable visual reasoning. In this study, a dual-attention learning network with word and sentence embedding (DALNet-WSE) is proposed. We design a module, transformer with sentence embedding (TSE), to extract a double embedding representation of questions containing keywords and medical information. A dual-attention learning (DAL) module consisting of self-attention and guided attention is proposed to model intensive intramodal and intermodal interactions. With multiple DAL modules (DALs), learning visual and textual co-attention can increase the granularity of understanding and improve visual reasoning. Experimental results on the ImageCLEF 2019 VQA-MED (VQA-MED 2019) and VQA-RAD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. According to the ablation studies and Grad-CAM maps, DALNet-WSE can extract rich textual information and has strong visual reasoning ability. IEEE"
"With the rise of social media, the rapid spread of rumors online has resulted in numerous negative effects on society and the economy. The methods for rumor detection have attracted great interest from both academia and industry. Given the widespread effectiveness of contrastive learning, many graph contrastive learning models for rumor detection have been proposed by using the event propagation structure as graph data. However, the existing contrastive models usually treat the propagation structure of other events similar to the anchor events as negative samples. While this design choice allows for discriminative learning, on the other hand, it also inevitably pushes apart semantically similar samples and, thus, degrades model performance. In this article, we propose a novel propagation fusion model called propagation structure fusion model based on node-level contrastive learning (PFNC) for rumor detection based on node-level contrastive learning. PFNC first obtains three augmented propagation structures by masking the text of each node in the propagation structure randomly and perturbing some edges in the propagation structure based on the importance of edges. Then, PFNC applies the node-level contrastive learning method between every two augmented propagation structures to prevent the samples with similar propagation structure from far away. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model is proposed to capture the relevant information that is consistent and supplementary among three augmented propagation structures by regarding the propagation structure of the event as a color picture, three augmented propagation structures as color channels, and each node as a pixel. The experimental results on real datasets show that the PFNC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models for rumor detection. IEEE"
"Hate speech or extremism detection among the text posts of social media is a major problem nowadays. Hate speech or extremism in text documents can be detected using machine learning methods or using sentiment lexicons. Machine learning methods require already classified data for training. In this paper we have proposed a framework to create sentiment lexicons for any language. In these lexicons terms will be added manually. The sentiment lexicons created by this framework may contain n-grams also where n > =1. As the proposed framework is used for creating sentiment lexicons for extremism or hate speech detection, it is better to include only negative terms in sentiment lexicons.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Purpose: We explored the application of a machine learning algorithm for the timely detection of potential abusive head trauma (AHT) using the first free-text note of an encounter and demographic information. Methods: First free-text physician notes and demographic information were collected for children under 5 years of age at a Level 1 Trauma Center. The control group, which included patients with head/neck injury, was compared to those with AHT diagnosed by the Child Protective Team. Differential scores accounted for words overrepresented in AHT patient vs. control notes. Sentiment scores were reflective of note positivity/negativity and subjectivity scores accounted for note subjectivity/objectivity. The composite scores reflected the patient's differential score modified by the subjectivity score. Composite, sentiment, and subjectivity scores combined with demographic information trained a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to predict AHT. Results: Final composite scores with demographic information were highly associated with AHT in a test dataset. The control group included 587 patients and the test group included 193 patients. Combining composite scores with demographic information into the RF model improved AHT classification area under the curve (AUC) from 0.68 to 0.78, with an overall accuracy of 84%. Feature importance analysis of our RF model revealed that composite score, sentiment, age, and subjectivity were the most impactful predictors of AHT. The sentiment was not significantly different between control and AHT notes (p = 0.87), while subjectivity trended higher for AHT notes (p = 0.081). Conclusion: We conclude that a machine learning algorithm can recognize patterns within free-text notes and demographic information that aid in AHT detection in children.

"Background: We previously developed web-based education to be used by patients prior to kidney transplant (KTX) evaluation. The current feasibility study evaluated patients’ intervention uptake and barriers, and staff experiences of the clinic-wide implementation in preparation for a definitive comparative effectiveness trial. Methods: Web links and login instructions to view 17 educational videos designed to promote KTX access were delivered via email or text to adults referred to a single transplant center between 10/2020 and 3/2021. Patient barriers were recorded. Non-completers were allowed to view the resources in the clinic. N = 7 clinic staff were interviewed about their experiences of in-clinic delivery of the web-education. Interviews were recorded with field notes and coded using simple content analysis. Patient characteristics and 30-month KTX access were examined with Chi-square, t-tests, and log-rank tests. Results: Of 210 patients, 71% completed the self-education remotely (completers), 16% attempted but did not complete remotely (attempters), and 13% declined the web link invitation (decliners). Implementation barriers included technology access and use difficulties, unstable internet connectivity, limited staff time in clinic to facilitate technology use by patients, and limited technology attentiveness by patients in clinic. In 3-group comparisons, remote decliners were older with worse estimated posttransplant survival scores, and attempters were younger, more often Medicaid insured, and lived in higher area deprivation; both were more often deemed ineligible for KTX than completers. Between-group time-to-transplantation was non-significant (p =.571). Conclusion: The majority of patients accessed the web-education remotely; however, more vulnerable demographic populations reported greater problems accessing web-education. In-clinic delivery was burdensome to staff and patients. Future adaptive implementation strategies are needed to allow for adequate patient education. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"Sentiment analysis is a sub-domain in opinion mining that extracts sentiments from the users' opinions from text messages. Opinions from E-commerce websites, blogs, online social media, etc., and these opinions are in the form of text, suggestions, and comments. This paper describes the new sentiment analysis model to predict sentiments effectively that can be used to improve product quality and sales. The proposed approach is an integrated model combining several techniques, such as the pre-trained model BERT-large-cased (BLC) for training the dataset. BLC model contains 24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters. Optimization algorithms can fine-tune pre-trained models, such as BERT, for sentiment analysis tasks. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained model on a specific sentiment analysis task to improve performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the optimized algorithm that helps to analyze the sentiments effectively from the given datasets. The next step is the combination of pre-processing techniques such as Tokenization, Stop Word Removal, etc. The next step focused on Bag-of-Words (BoW) and word embedding techniques like Word2Vec used to extract the features from the datasets. The deep sentiment analysis (DSA) based classification is designed to classify the sentiments based on aspect and priority model to achieve better results. The proposed model combines Aspect and Priority-based Sentiment analysis with a Decision-based Recurrent Neural Network (D-RNN). The experiments are conducted using Twitter, Restaurant, and Laptop datasets available publicly on Kaggle - the proposed model's performance is analyzed using a confusion matrix. The proposed approach addresses various challenges in analyzing the sentiment analysis. Python programming language with several libraries such as Keras, Pandas, and others extracts the sentiments from given datasets. The comparison between the existing and proposed models shows the effectiveness of the sentiment outputs.  © 2013 IEEE."
"This article examines Ken Saro-Wiwa’s (1941–1995) vision for the Ogoni people through an ecocritical interrogation of his short fiction and poetry. Academic analyses of the Ogoni struggle have been unfailingly anthropocentric in their approaches. This article challenges this dominant epistemology by centring the non-human world. I examine Saro-Wiwa’s collection of short stories ‘A Forest of Flowers’, the poetry anthology ‘Songs in a Time of War’, and his final poems written in prison in the 1990s. An ecocritical reading of these texts will reveal how Saro-Wiwa invokes pastoral tropes and romantic portrayals of a pre-oil ecological paradise to articulate a primordial eco-nationalist Ogoni identity. Throughout his fiction, the fate of the people and the natural world are intertwined, and notions of home and community expand beyond the human to incorporate the ecosystem of the bioregion. © 2023 ASLE-UKI."
"Background: The intertwined fields of technical and professional communication (TPC) and user experience (UX) have positioned graduates of TPC programs as strong candidates for careers in UX. Literature review: Although there is some scholarship addressing competencies required for UX positions as well as some investigation into UX course content within TPC programs, there is still a need for a comparative analysis of outcomes in UX courses in TPC and industry expectations for UX positions. Research questions: 1. What qualifications are essential to current UX industry positions&#x003F; What qualifications are stated in current UX industry advertisements&#x003F; 2. How do these qualifications compare to a sample of existing UX outcomes within TPC programs&#x003F; Research methodology: A qualitative content analysis of two datasets&#x2014;a collection of UX job advertisements and a collection of UX course outcomes&#x2014;was conducted through a systematic coding of texts. Qualifications and outcomes were categorized by UX competencies needed prior to employment. Results&#x002F;discussion: Results show job ads prioritize on project management including Agile and Scrum, and other skills such as writing, designing prototypes, software and coding languages, and portfolios. Course outcomes reflect strengths in writing and design, but do not include significant reference to specific concepts or tools. Suggestions for improving TPC&#x002F;UX courses include diversifying existing skills and addressing deficient skills in project management and digital literacies. Conclusion: Challenges for re-envisioning UX courses in TPC programs are considered and addressed. IEEE"
"A crucial step in deciphering a text is to identify what set of characters were used to write it. This requires grouping character tokens according to visual and contextual features, which can be challenging for human analysts when the number of tokens or underlying types is large. Prior work has shown that this process can be automated by clustering dense representations of character images, in a task which we call “script clustering”. In this work, we present novel architectures which exploit varying degrees of contextual and visual information to learn representations for use in script clustering. We evaluate on a range of modern and ancient scripts, and find that our models produce representations which are more effective for script recovery than the current state-of-the-art, despite using just 2% as many parameters. Our analysis fruitfully applies these models to assess hypotheses about the character inventory of the partially-deciphered proto-Elamite script. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an NLP task that classify fine-grained sentiment towards one specific aspect from the same text. While Pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT have been widely researched in ABSA, attaching aspects to corresponding sentiment remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Multi-prompt learning Model (3M) to introduce more proper semantic information for different task aims. In 3M, the ABSA task is divided into two subtasks, a classification task for aspect categorization and a generation task for sentiment analysis. For specific task, we design respective prompt learning approach to help model understand ABSA more accurately. Note that the overfitting using BERT on ABSA, we utilize the method of float loss to restrict the training not too small. The experiment result shows that 3M achieves results comparable to SOTA. © 2023 IEEE."
"Research has verified that associative learning will improve learning efficiency during the process of recognizing Chinese characters. Therefore, some scholars believe that the associative information guided by radical molecules is the key to ensuring semantic understanding robustness and have incorporated it into their models. However, characters with the same radical are also often associated and widely used as contextual cues to enhance semantic understanding. This indicates that the information of the same radical has a positive effect in learning text. From the perspective of semantic complementarity between characters with the same radical, we drew inspiration and proposed a novel Same-radical Character Association Model (SCAM) for text classification in Chinese. SCAM aims to enhance model learning and training of text classification tasks by integrating same-radical characters. The model can be segmented into three processors, same radical extension processor, critical feature selection processor and cognitive and prediction processor. Experiment results shows the proposed model excels existing system in CNT, TNT and THUC databases, which indicates that integrating same-radical information will improve the Chinese text classification tasks.

"General-purpose multiply-accumulate (MAC) accelerators have become inevitable in the internet-of-things (IoT) edge devices for performing computationally intensive tasks such as deep learning, signal processing, and combinatorial optimization. The throughput and the energy-efficiency of the conventional digital processors and MAC accelerators are limited due to their sparse design owing to the von-Neumann architecture. Although mixed-signal time-mode MAC accelerators utilizing emerging non-volatile memories appear promising owing to their ability to perform in-memory MAC operation via the physical laws, their application is limited due to their incompatibility and complex integration with the CMOS process, high sensitivity to process variations, large operating voltage/cell currents, etc. To mitigate these issues, in this work, we propose a time-mode MAC accelerator based on ferroelectric-FinFETs with CMOS-compatible doped-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\text{HfO}_\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> in the gate-stack. Our rigorous analysis reveals a trade-off between the performance metrics such as computational precision, area-and energy-efficiency of the proposed MAC accelerator. Therefore, we provide the necessary design guidelines to further optimize the performance. Extensive design space exploration and simulations exploiting an experimentally calibrated compact model for the doped <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\text{HfO}_\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> ferroelectric capacitor along with experimentally calibrated baseline FinFET model for 14 nm-technology indicates that the proposed MAC accelerator exhibits an energy-efficiency of 800 TeraOperations/Joule, a considerably high area-efficiency of 12.607 bits/<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu\text{m}^{\text{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> (including I/O peripheral circuitry), and a throughput of 2.5 TeraOp/s while supporting a 4-bit MAC operation for a square weight matrix of size 200 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\times$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 200 which is sufficient for realistic inference tasks.

"We introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given task instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions explaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders from prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and domains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive loss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are unseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval to semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR, while having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best model, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our analysis suggests that INSTRUCTOR is robust to changes in instructions, and that instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model on diverse datasets.

"Animal welfare is a field with increasing significance and has been raising huge concerns of the public and the political stage. Cats and dogs possess an important role in human life, but their welfare is not always secured from a legal aspect. This review aimed to describe the evolution and geographical distribution of “cats and dogs” and “puppies and kittens” welfare literature over the last 40 years, distinguish the main research topics studied and highlight gaps in knowledge. A search using Scopus® was performed with different search strings and predetermined filters as time range, language, and subject area. A total of 2,725 scientific literature records were retrieved but only the ones that referred to cats and dogs’ welfare aspects were retained. The final 1,775 records were processed through descriptive statistics, and text mining and topic analysis procedures were performed on their titles and abstracts. The results showed that the number of studies has been increasing, especially in Europe and North America. “Shelter” was the most frequent word, followed by “behavior,” “owner” and “adopt.” The nine topics that emerged from the analysis were breeding, stress and housing conditions, welfare and pain assessment, public health, shelter management and euthanasia, behavioral problems, health issues and management, human-animal interaction, and owners’ and veterinarians’ perceptions. While stress and housing conditions, public health, and owners’ and veterinarians’ perceptions were the most studied topics, human-animal interaction was the least studied. This review confirmed the increasing research and interest in cats’ and dogs’ welfare and showed gaps in knowledge where further studies are needed.

"In this study, an innovative mixed regulator based on integer and fractional order control is suggested for load frequency management. Tilt Integral Derivative with Filter (TIDF) and Proportional Integral Derivative Fractional Derivative with Filter (PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$ ) are the two components of the suggested hybrid, which is called TIDF-PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$. The advantages of the TIDF, the PIDD, and the fractional derivative regulators are combined in the proposed TIDF-PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$ regulator. In order to enhance the suggested TIDF-PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$ parameters in the investigated dual-area power grids, an innovative technique is used that is based on the newly reported Orca Predation Algorithm (OPA). The suggested TIDF-PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$ regulator is part of a centralized control plan that takes into account the role of electric vehicles (EVs). Comparing the performance of the proposed TIDF-PID $^{\mathrm {\mu }}\text{D}$ regulator against that of previously published FOI-TD and PIDD2-PD associated with filters provides promising outcomes. In addition, the OPA optimizer's outcomes are contrasted to those of newly published optimization techniques such as the Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO), Gradient Based Optimizer (GBO), Battle Royale Optimizer (BRO), and Remora Optimization Algorithm (ROA), and the OPA optimizer has been shown to achieve better results. Taking into account non-linear limitations and the existence of renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar farms, wind farms, and EVs, this study examines the issue of frequency stability in a hybrid dual-area power system with thermal and hydraulic turbines.

"Digital transformation is a core weapon to promote the sustainable development of environmental service enterprises. This research presents a pioneering analysis of the primary sources and internal mechanisms underlying the performance impact of digital transformation in Chinese listed environmental service companies from 2009 to 2019. The empirical results show that digital transformation can significantly improve firm performance. Furthermore, digital products, digital operations and digital talent were found to have the most significant effect, while digital services and digital marketing have a weaker effect. The mediating effect demonstrates that digital transformation can indirectly promote the performance of environmental service enterprises by improving the green technology innovation, and this influence tends to strengthen. In addition, this performance effect is affected by different enterprise types, with the effect being more pronounced in state-owned enterprises than in private enterprises. These findings have important guiding significance for the intelligent development of environmental service industry. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company."
"The study is devoted to the description of the linguopragmatic potential of media texts in the context of the informational and psychological impact on the individual and collective addressee of mass information broadcasting. As the key modern form of text existence in the information space, a media text contains not only verbal elements that influence the audience through either spoken or written words, but also non-verbal ones, introduced through video, picture and various sound means other than speech. The combined combination of communicative means of linguistic and non-linguistic nature enhances the information-psychological impact on the audience by achieving a synergistic effect. Due to the fact that with the complex use of verbal and non-verbal means, the media text acquires such essential characteristics as polycode and multimodality, its analysis should take into account not only the linguistic proper, but also the extralinguistic aspects of communication. Modern media text has a complex communicative structure that combines a text, hypertext, dynamic (static) image and sound, and provides a non-linear, multi-channel, multi-layered and multi-dimensional perception of the embedded conceptual and stylistic meanings. The aim of the study is to analyze linguopragmatic characteristics of a media text as the primary form of the informational and psychological impact realization in the modern mass media discourse. Descriptive, synchronic, diachronic and functional methods of research, as well as methods of contextual and communicative-pragmatic analysis have been employed. As to the material, the study is based on the analysis of theoretical works by Russian and foreign linguists for the past 30 years. The authors concluded that the information-psychological impact is enhanced by the use of PR and advertising techniques in the media text and is largely based on their application. © Akhrenova N.A., Zaripov R.I., 2023."
"The recent advance of video retrieval has been driven by large-scale visual-language pretraining models. In particular, the state-of-the-art approaches are mainly based on temporal extension of the well-known CLIP model. However, they ignore a critical problem in video retrieval, i.e., the text often refers to a small snippet in the corresponding video. Blindly aggregating all the frames inevitably reduces the discriminative capacity of the final video token to match the text token. Hence, these approaches are limited to retrieve complex videos with diversified contents. To tackle this problem, we propose a concise and novel Attentive Snippet Prompting (ASP) framework, which can dynamically exploit the text-relevant video snippet to boost retrieval. Specifically, our ASP consists of two simple but effective modules, i.e., snippet prompting and video aggregating. Given a pair of text and video, snippet prompting can smartly use cross-modal attention to construct a text-driven visual prompt, namely attentive snippet token, which adaptively describes the relevant video snippet of the text query. Alternatively, video aggregating can summarize all the frame tokens as a video token, for providing the global context. With cooperation of attentive snippet token and global video token, our ASP can effectively learn a robust and text-relevant visual representation for video retrieval. Finally, we evaluate our ASP framework on the widely-used benchmarks, where it simply outperforms a number of recent approaches with a large margin. The codes will be released at at <uri>https://github.com/Sranc3/ASP4retrieval</uri>. IEEE"
"Digital health interventions are gaining ground in conflict-affected countries, but studies on their reproductive health benefits for women are scanty. Focusing on conflict-affected northern Nigeria, this study examined the relationships between Internet use, exposure to digital family planning messages via text messages or social media, and sexual agency–measured as the ability to refuse sex and ask a male partner to use a condom–among partnered women including the rural-urban differentials. Partnered women's data (n= 18,205) from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey were analysed using descriptive and multinomial logistic regression analyses. 44.6% of women are able to refuse sex, and 31.4% to ask a male partner to use a condom. Internet use was positively associated with women's ability to refuse sex in the northern region and urban areas, and across the region to ask a male partner to use a condom. It was also positively associated with women's uncertainty about asking a male partner to use a condom. Exposure to digital family planning messages was positively associated with women's ability to ask a male partner to use a condom across the region, in both urban and rural areas. However, exposure to digital family planning messages was negatively associated with women's uncertainty in urban areas about their ability to refuse sex. Implications of these findings for digital family planning interventions are discussed. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The problem of subjectivity detection is often approached as a preparatory binary task for sentiment analysis, despite the fact that theoretically subjectivity is often defined as a matter of degree. In this work, we approach subjectivity analysis as a regression task and test the efficiency of a transformer RoBERTa model in annotating subjectivity of online news, including news from social media, based on a small subset of human-labeled training data. The results of experiments comparing our model to an existing rule-based subjectivity regressor and a state-of-the-art binary classifier reveal that: 1) our model highly correlates with the human subjectivity ratings and outperforms the widely used rule-based pattern subjectivity regressor (De Smedt and Daelemans, 2012); 2) our model performs well as a binary classifier and generalizes to the benchmark subjectivity dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004); 3) in contrast, state-of-the-art classifiers trained on the benchmark dataset show catastrophic performance on our human-labeled data. The results bring to light the issues of the gold standard subjectivity dataset, and the models trained on it, which seem to distinguish between the origin/style of the texts rather than subjectivity as perceived by human English speakers. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The task of predicting reader appreciation or literary quality has been the object of several studies. It remains, however, a challenging problem in quantitative literary analyses and computational linguistics alike, as its definition can vary a lot depending on the genre of literary texts considered, the features adopted, and the annotation system employed. This paper attempts to evaluate the impact on reader appreciation, defined as online users’ ratings, of sentiment range and sentiment arc patterns versus traditional stylometric features. We run our experiments on a corpus of English-language literary fiction, showing that stylometric features alone are helpful in modelling literary quality, but can be outperformed by analysing the novels’ sentimental profile. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Humans have a natural tendency to express their emotions, but they are also skilled at using sarcasm to shape their feelings. In cognitive computing and natural language processing research, sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection are typically treated as separate tasks, with each text analyzed in isolation. However, this approach overlooks the connection between sentiment and sarcasm. We believe that sentiment and sarcasm are closely related and should be analyzed together to achieve a better understanding of context and natural language. In this paper, we propose a new framework that leverages the Cognitive Relationship (CR) between sarcasm and sentiment to improve the accuracy of classification. By taking into account the relationship between these two factors, we can achieve better results in sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. We have also created a new and nearly balanced dataset for sentiment and sarcasm classification in standard Urdu that contains 7,000 tweets, which make up over 210K tokens. To gain a better understanding of the data, we conducted exploratory data analysis on words, hashtags, and emojis. The proposed methodology conducted a variety of classical machine learning classifiers and tested them with different variations of the dataset. After a thorough analysis of the results and errors, we found that the CR-based approach for sarcasm and sentiment classification performed better than the traditional stand-alone (SA) approach. Among the classifiers, Linear Regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting proved to be the most effective. The sentiment classification based on CR has demonstrated a 9.3% enhancement compared to the stand-alone (SA) method while maintaining an overall improvement of approximately 22% compared to the baseline distribution. In the same way, the sarcasm classification based on CR has shown a 9.1% improvement over the SA approach and approximately 23.6% improvement over the baseline distribution.  © 2013 IEEE."

"In recent years, online misinformation has become increasingly prevalent, leading to significant issues such as political polarisation and distrust of genuine information. Misinformation on social media platforms affects various aspects of society, including health and politics, and can take many forms, such as text and images. However, current studies mainly focus on analysing singular topics and modalities, without considering the heterogeneity of the issue. Our research aimed to examine the relationship between visual elements and engagement, as well as the relationship between sentiment analysis, hate speech, and bots on a variety of topics on the Twitter social media platform Twitter. We labelled 12,581 misinformation posts that were manually modelled into a topic hierarchy. We then analysed these posts, including their sentiments, the prevalence of hate speech, and bot activity on different topics. The results revealed that political misinformation tends to contain more hate speech than COVID-19 misinformation and that political misinformation also has a higher number of bots. Furthermore, the findings suggest that misinformation online with more than 40% negative sentences can have a high level of hate speech identified for both tweets and replies. This study provides detailed information on topics and the volume of misinformation on social media platforms, and the findings can be used to develop more advanced detection systems and support further analysis. Our findings can help policy makers understand what kind of online misinformation has been spreading on Twitter and how to plan campaigns to make users more aware of how to spot its various features in an online user-to-user Twitter environment.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to recognize the sentiment polarity of an aspect in reviews. In general, to analyze the sentiment of an aspect in a sentence, it is essential to capture the dependencies between aspects and the corresponding contexts. Recently, graph neural networks over global dependency structures like dependency trees or self-attention score matrices have been explored for this task. However, these models rely heavily on the quality of information extracted from the global dependency structures. In the meantime, the pairwise correlations between aspects and contexts provide an equally important perspective for sentiment analysis, which is usually ignored in previous works. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis by integrating the information extracted from global dependency structures as well as pairwise correlations. To capture the aspect-to-text correlations, we design a CAGCN module based on the cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to effectively exploit the syntactic graph, we design an SAGCN module with the self-attention mechanism to build the overall text-to-text connections. Experimental results on five benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed model, producing significantly better results than the baselines. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"This article sheds light on how to capture knowledge integration dynamics in college course content, improves and enriches the definition and measurement of interdisciplinarity, and expands the scope of research on the benefits of interdisciplinarity to postcollege outcomes. We distinguish between what higher education institutions claim regarding interdisciplinarity and what they appear to actually do. We focus on the core academic element of student experience—the courses they take, develop a text-based semantic measure of interdisciplinarity in college curriculum, and test its relationship to average earnings of graduates from different types of schools of higher education. We observe that greater exposure to interdisciplinarity—especially for science majors—is associated with increased earnings after college graduation. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

"Annotators are not fungible. Their demographics, life experiences, and backgrounds all contribute to how they label data. However, NLP has only recently considered how annotator identity might influence their decisions. Here, we present POPQUORN (the Potato-Prolific dataset for Question-Answering, Offensiveness, text Rewriting and politeness rating with demographic Nuance). POPQUORN contains 45,000 annotations from 1,484 annotators, drawn from a representative sample regarding sex, age, and race as the US population. Through a series of analyses, we show that annotators’ background plays a significant role in their judgments. Further, our work shows that backgrounds not previously considered in NLP (e.g., education), are meaningful and should be considered. Our study suggests that understanding the background of annotators and collecting labels from a demographically balanced pool of crowd workers is important to reduce the bias of datasets.

"The article focuses on satanic elements within the subcultural style of black metal. The text is based on own long-term qualitative research, in particular the analysis of interviews with Czech black metallers aged 21-33, supplemented by ethnographic findings from 2010 to the present. The study shows the function of satanic elements both as a source of style resistance to what is perceived by the participants as mainstream, and also their connection with the formation of anti-Christian ideology, which must also include an anti-social and anti-cultural aspect. From the point of view of the use of satanic elements, the participants particularly emphasized the period of adolescence, when for them, within their own image, satanic elements played an important role as a subcultural code communicated to the surrounding society. At the same time, Satanist elements played a role in shaping the participants' own religiosity, specifically Satanist identities. © 2023 National Institute of Folk Culture. All rights reserved."

"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a challenging task in natural language processing that involves identifying the sentiment polarity of different aspects in a given text. While graph convolutional network (GCN) has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for ABSA, existing methods typically rely on investigating a single type of feature in the sentence to construct the graph representation, which may not capture enough relevant information. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages multiple channels to extract multiple features, including aspect relations, word dependency relation types, and semantic information, to enhance the performance of the model. We evaluate our approach on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate its validity, achieving state-of-the-art results. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of our model. Our findings suggest that the combination of multiple channels and multiple features GCN is crucial for achieving the best performance in ABSA tasks. In conclusion, our proposed approach provides a promising solution to the ABSA problem and contributes to advancing the field by highlighting the importance of considering multiple features and leveraging the power of multiple channels GCN to improve performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"The field of environmental criminology is a staple theoretical framework in contemporary criminological theory. This fully revised and expanded edition of the world’s first comprehensive and sole-authored textbook on this influential school of criminological thought covers a wide range of topics, including: the origins of environmental criminology; the primary theoretical frameworks, such as social disorganization theory, the routine activity approach, geometry of crime, rational choice perspective, and multilevel models that integrate environmental criminology; the practical application of environmental criminology; an examination of how theories are operationalized and tested; and policy implications for the practice of crime prevention. As well as these popular topics, Martin Andresen also discusses a number of topics that are at the leading edge of research within environmental criminology. New to the third edition is an expanded coverage on multilevel models of environmental criminology, harm indices, crime mapping, hot-spot policing, and future directions in environmental criminology. This text will be ideal for courses on crime prevention, where students are often encouraged to consider policy problems and apply theory to practice. This book offers up environmental criminology as a theoretical framework for making sense of complex neighborhood problems, so it is also perfect for courses on geography of crime, crime analysis, and, indeed, environmental criminology. It would also be a good supplement for courses on criminological theory. © 2024 Martin A. Andresen."
"The primary aim of this study was to compare the listening comprehension levels of four groups of people who listened to recordings that varied in terms of the percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS). The secondary aim was to examine the effects of %SS, attention/hyperactivity, and perfectionism on comprehension. Sixty-four fluent participants between the ages of 18-40 were randomly assigned to four gender-equivalent groups. All participants completed ADHD and perfectionism scales. A clinician read aloud a text, exhibiting different levels (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) of %SSs (speech naturalness r>0.800). Each group of participants listened to a recording with a different %SS level. The comprehension performance was evaluated with the Listening Comprehension Assessment Tool developed by the authors. The content validity measures of the tool were sufficient for teachers and clinicians (X̅ >0.800). The group that listened to the fluent (0%) recording scored significantly higher than the other groups on mean comprehension scores. Covariance analysis indicated that only the %SS level significantly affected the comprehension score. © 2023 Universidad de Castilla la Mancha. All rights reserved."

"Aspect-based multimodal sentiment analysis (ABMSA) is an important sentiment analysis task that analyses aspect-specific sentiment in data with different modalities (usually multimodal data with text and images). Previous works usually ignore the overall sentiment tendency when analyzing the sentiment of each aspect term. However, the overall sentiment tendency is highly correlated with aspect-specific sentiment. In addition, existing methods neglect to explore and make full use of the fine-grained multimodal information closely related to aspect terms. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-perspective fusion network (DPFN) that considers both global and local fine-grained sentiment information in multimodal data. From the global perspective, we use text-image caption pairs to obtain a global representation containing information about the overall sentiment tendencies. From the local fine-grained perspective, we construct two graph structures to explore the fine-grained information in texts and images. Finally, aspect-level sentiment polarities can be obtained by analyzing the combination of global and local fine-grained sentiment information. Experimental results on two multimodal Twitter datasets show that the proposed DPFN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the association between human chorionic gonadotropin and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data Sources: Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane were searched in November 2021 using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and relevant key words. Study Eligibility Criteria: This analysis included published full-text studies of pregnant women with serum human chorionic gonadotropin testing between 8 and 28 weeks of gestation, investigating fetal outcomes (fetal death in utero, small for gestational age, preterm birth) or maternal factors (hypertension in pregnancy: preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, placental abruption, HELLP syndrome, gestational diabetes mellitus). Methods: Studies were extracted using REDCap software. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess for risk of bias. Final meta-analyses underwent further quality assessment using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method. Results: A total of 185 studies were included in the final review, including the outcomes of fetal death in utero (45), small for gestational age (79), preterm delivery (62), hypertension in pregnancy (107), gestational diabetes mellitus (29), placental abruption (17), and HELLP syndrome (2). Data were analyzed separately on the basis of categorical measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin measured on a continuous scale. Eligible studies underwent meta-analysis to generate a pooled odds ratio (categorical human chorionic gonadotropin level) or difference in medians (human chorionic gonadotropin continuous scale) between outcome groups. First-trimester low human chorionic gonadotropin levels were associated with preeclampsia and fetal death in utero, whereas high human chorionic gonadotropin levels were associated with preeclampsia. Second-trimester high human chorionic gonadotropin levels were associated with fetal death in utero and preeclampsia. Conclusion: Human chorionic gonadotropin levels are associated with placenta-mediated adverse pregnancy outcomes. Both high and low human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the first trimester of pregnancy can be early warning signs of adverse outcomes. Further analysis of human chorionic gonadotropin subtypes and pregnancy outcomes is required to determine the diagnostic utility of these findings in reference to specific cutoff values. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Differentiation of closely related biological species using molecular genetic analysis is important for breeding farm animals, creating hybrid lines, maintaining the genetic purity of breeds, lines and layering. Bos grunniens and Bos taurus differentiation based on STR locus polymorphism will help maintain the genetic isolation of these species and identify hybrid individuals. The aim of this study is to assess the differentiating potential of 15 microsatellite loci to distinguish between domestic yak (B. grunniens) bred in the Kalmak-Ashuu highland region (Kochkor district, Naryn region, Kyrgyz Republic) and cattle (B. taurus) of three breeds (Aberdeen-Angus, Holstein and Alatau) using molecular genetic analysis. The samples were genotyped at 15 microsatellite loci (ETH3, INRA023, TGLA227, TGLA126, TGLA122, SPS115, ETH225, TGLA53, BM2113, BM1824, ETH10, BM1818, CSSM66, ILSTS006 and CSRM60). Twelve of the loci were from the standard markers panel recommended by ISAG. Statistical analysis was performed using GenAlEx v.6.503, Structure v.2.3.4, PAST v.4.03, and POPHELPER v1.0.10. The analysis of the samples’ subpopulation structure using the Structure v.2.3.4 and 15 STR locus genotyping showed that the accuracy of assigning a sample to B. taurus was 99.6 ± 0.4 %, whereas the accuracy of assigning a sample to B. grunniens was 99.2 ± 2.6 %. Of the 15 STRs, the greatest potential to differentiate B. grunniens and B. taurus was found in those with the maximal calculated FST values, including BM1818 (0.056), BM1824 (0.041), BM2113 (0.030), CSSM66 (0.034) and ILSTS006 (0.063). The classification accuracy of B. grunniens using only these five microsatellite loci was 98.8 ± 3.4 %, similar for B. taurus, 99.1 ± 1.2 %. The proposed approach, based on the molecular genetic analysis of 5 STR loci, can be used as an express test in Kyrgyzstan breeding and reproduction programs for B. grunniens. © Chekirov K.B., Isakova Zh.T., Kipen V.N., Irsaliev M.I., Mukeeva S.B., Aitbaev K.A., Sharshenalieva G.A., Beyshenalieva S.B., Kydyralieva B.U., 2023."
"Introduction: Social anxiety is common and can have far-reaching implications for affected individuals, both on social life and working performance. Usage of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has gained traction. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effect of stand-alone VRET on social anxiety symptoms. Method: We searched systematically in PubMed, Embase, PSYCinfo, and ERIC in May 2022 for studies with participants with social anxiety symptoms receiving stand-alone VRET. Two reviewers independently selected relevant studies in a two-step procedure, and the risk of bias was assessed. Results: Of 158 hits, 7 studies were selected for full-text reading, 6 were chosen for evaluation, and 5 were included in meta-analyses. VRET resulted in a significantly lower anxiety score in treated individuals with a standard mean difference of −0.82, 95% confidence interval –1.52 to –0.13, compared to controls. Conclusion: Stand-alone VRET may reduce social anxiety symptoms. However, despite promising results, there is still uncertainty as the effect estimate is based on few studies with few participants each and a high risk of bias. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Cross-modal Retrieval (CMR) is formulated for the scenarios where the queries and retrieval results are of different modalities. Existing CMR studies mainly focus on the common contextualized information between text transcripts and images, and the synchronized event information in audio-visual recordings. Different from all previous works, in this paper, we investigate the geometric correspondence between images and speech recordings captured in the same space and formulate a novel CMR task, called Spatial Image-Acoustic Retrieval (SIAR). To this end, we first design a novel speech encoder that consists of convolution neural networks and transformer layers, to learn space-aware speech representations. Then, to eliminate the crossmodal inherent discrepancy, we propose the Contrastive Speech Image Retrieval (CSIR) method which uses supervised contrastive learning to attract the same-space cross-modal features while repelling the ones from different spaces. Finally, image and speech features are directly compared and we predict the SIAR result with the maximum similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed speech encoder can recognize space from human speeches with superior performance over the other prevailing networks. It also sets our penultimate goal of speech-to-speech retrieval. Furthermore, our CSIR proposal can successfully perform bi-directional SIAR between spatial images and reverberant speeches with promising results. Code and data will be available. IEEE"
"Virtual try-on of eyeglasses involves placing eyeglasses of different shapes and styles onto a face image without physically trying them on. While existing methods have shown impressive results, the variety of eyeglasses styles is limited and the interactions are not always intuitive or efficient. To address these limitations, we propose GlassesCLIP, a text-guided eyeglasses manipulation method with spatial constraints, which allows for control of the eyeglasses shape and style based on a binary mask and text, respectively. Specifically, we introduce a mask encoder to extract mask conditions and a modulation module that enables simultaneous injection of text and mask conditions. This design allows for fine-grained control of the eyeglasses&#x0027; appearance based on both textual descriptions and spatial constraints. Our approach includes a disentangled mapper and a decoupling strategy that preserves irrelevant areas, resulting in better local editing. We employ a two-stage training scheme to handle the different convergence speeds of the various modality conditions, successfully controlling both the shape and style of eyeglasses. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving diverse eyeglasses styles while preserving irrelevant areas. Author"
"Due to the digitalization, there exists an increased amount of user-generated content on the Internet, where people express their opinions on various topics.

We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology using Amazon product reviews as the source data. Analyzing text-based content such as Amazon customers’ reviews through text analytics and sentiment analysis can help Amazon and other online retailers to discover valuable actionable insights regarding their products. The contributions of this study are twofolds: to examine the predictive power of machine learning (ML) algorithms with respect to predicting sentiment scores and to analyze patterns in the differences between scores obtained from different sentiment scoring algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Introduction: Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide, which leads to the death of more than 9 million people annually. The global impact of the Coronavirus epidemic on mental health includes insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Therefore, given the current situation, innovations such as telemedicine to provide prevention and treatment services for people with mental disorders seem necessary. Methods: A literature review was performed according to the preferred items to report in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Covering a period from January 2020 to July 2023, we conducted a systematic literature search on five electronic databases (PubMed-Mesh, Scopus, Web of Science, Science direct, and PsycInfo). The search strategy included three categories of keywords: Mental health, Tele, COVID-19. Results: A total of 112 articles were identified by searching the databases of published articles, 13 articles met our inclusion criteria. A total of 76.2% of them were related to patients with stress, anxiety, and depression issues. We found that the real-time method has been the most common method used to communicate between the physician and the patient (92.3%). The communication technologies used also included telephone, video call, video conference, and E-mail. During these communications, data was exchanged in text, voice, and video formats. In three studies (27%), interoperability with other systems was mentioned. In addition, 69.2% of the studies reported challenges, the most important of which were access to electronic and communication devices, network connection problems, audio and video problems, and privacy issues. Conclusions: Considering the many advantages of telemedicine technology in the field of mental health, the need to use this technology in developing countries, including our country, is obvious. But the application of these technologies requires the investigation of technical aspects and challenges related to them as much as possible, which have been seen in few studies. © 2023 The Authors.

"In an era of increasing globalization, the imperative for understanding multilingual texts elevated the role of translation to an everyday necessity. The efficacy of contemporary Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems was heavily dependent on the availability of substantial training data. As such, the creation of an expansive parallel corpus became a strategic focal point, providing a bedrock for the evolution of high-caliber NMT systems. However, building a parallel corpus often posed challenges due to its complexity and cost, especially for language pairs that lacked sufficient parallel data. To tackle this challenge, this study proposed a novel data augmentation method for the corpus. Bilingual news texts sourced from the KEKE English website were utilized, and SentenceBERT was employed to ensure accurate sentence alignment. Subsequently, the parallel partial sentences within the corpus were filtered and used to augment the dataset. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was assessed by calculating BLEU, chrF and METEOR scores based on both the original corpus and the data-augmented corpus using the base translation model. The experimental results indicated that compared to the baseline method, the optimal method showed an improvement of 0.4-2.1 points in BLEU scores, an improvement of 0.5-2.7 points in chrF scores, and an increase of 0.5-1.6 points in METEOR scores.  © 2013 IEEE."
"In this study, we carry out a comparative analysis of the functionalities of a repository of 11 open access and online self-correction tools that contribute to the development of English writing skills and self-learning abilities in online and distance English Foreign Language (EFL) learning contexts. The repository has been designed based on Al-Ahdal’s (2020) taxonomy of self-correction online tools and the embedded resources for each tool (description of the tool, video tutorials and a checklist of the functionalities) have been hosted in an institutional blog. The second objective of our study entails the wide circulation of the repository among EFL learners to explore their learning experience with the navigation and the use of the tools with their own written productions, as measured via a tailor-made research survey. The EFL learners’ experience will contribute to shed light on establishing selection criteria for the use of one tool over another based on the users’ learning objectives in proofreading their own written productions with the aid of technological tools. The results of this study have revealed that there are common functionalities among the interface of the 11 open access and online tools available in the repository, namely, the identification of spelling and grammar errors, along with the display of synonyms for words that have not been used in an adequate linguistic context. However, some differences have been observed and, in particular, the inclusion of more advanced functionalities in certain tools of the repository. As for the EFL learners’ experience with the navigation and their self-correction practice with some of their own written productions, our findings have evidenced that, although all the tools provide a user-friendly interface, Hemingway, LanguageTool and Spell Check Plus have been reported to be more intuitive in terms of the navigation through their functionalities. Furthermore, the resources available in the repository have been considered to be highly effective in contributing to encourage learners in the process of writing texts and, in particular, for those learners that reported to have low digital competence. Finally, Hemingway, Spell Check Plus and Grammarly have been pointed out by the respondents of the survey that exhibiting a significant utility impact on improving the quality of English written texts, as explained by the functionalities that they offer. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

"Lately, people have been impacted by the increased use of social media platforms like Twitter in disseminating the various news and information. However, a lot of this content has been shown to be false or unreliable. It takes a lot of time to manually evaluate the veracity of such contents. As a result, research has been conducted to develop a classifier or credibility analyzer for fake/disinformation content utilizing different machine learning and deep learning techniques. The majority of existing approaches rely on data that has been manually classified as authentic or fraudulent, but by ignoring the semantic context of the text/content. Therefore, in this paper, we study a method that analyzes the semantic meaning of the text/content and use the content that has been published on multiple legitimate news websites as our source of truth. Core architecture of our approach consists of six different components that can be generalized to access the credibility of text contents published in social media. Specifically, we employ a fine-tuned sentence transformers model to extract the semantic meaning from texts, use web scraping to extract the news similar to the tweets from multiple sources and then compare them to assign a credibility score. Our results show that our approach is more effective than existing approaches since it immediately validates the social media contents with multiple reliable news media.

"This article compares four different classification algorithms based on their performance in determining the sentiment based on the subjective context of the IMDB Movie Review Data. The classification algorithms used are logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and XGB. Text data pre-processing including the determination of the weight of each word has been done using the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) Vectorizer. Sentiment analysis may also know to be opinion mining, which is the procedure for determining whether the text reveals positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Through this analysis, business managers can acquire a deep perception of customer opinions about their products. Consumer feedback can influence how well a product performs and the decision to track it can be the difference between a successful product launch and a missed opportunity. By highlighting possibilities to reimagine the user experience, it can also guide marketing and product development. Few metrics measures have been applied to test the efficacy of considered four classifiers and experimented outcome is presented in terms of superior accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Information overload due to unstructured text is the greatest problem in natural language processing (NLP). A number of studies seeking to solve classification problems have been conducted on word-embedding techniques like word2vec and GloVe, but these models have the problem of out-of-vocabulary words. This study examines the word-embedding techniques word2vec, GloVe, fastText, and BERT for sentiment classification using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The accuracy of these models is calculated using the IMDB review dataset, which contains 50,000 text reviews. The word-embedding model is compared with traditional text representations, BOW and TF-IDF. The results indicate that word embedding with the BERT approach generates the greatest accuracy. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Software testing takes almost 50% of the cost and time of the development complex software systems. Existing clustering methods for researching software testing results are analyzed, their advantages and disadvantages are revealed. Based on analysis of the results of previous studies, software development requirements for testing errors classification were formed. The main software requirements are ensuring the accuracy of software error classification; the ability to create categories and subcategories for error clustering; and the ability to view the status of test automation in real time. The proposed software methodology centers on utilizing the stack trace as the primary data to be clustered, as this part contains pertinent information regarding the reason for the test's “failure”. Software testing errors classification method was developed using kNN algorithm for automatic analysis of test results. The kNN algorithm is applied to the task of analyzing software testing results, which allows to assign the text of the software test result to the categories, specified by the user. In automatic software error analysis, clustering 1000 failed tests using the kNN algorithm yields an accuracy of 0.982, which is the highest result among the clustering methods studied (kNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes). The kNN algorithm stands out for providing flexibility in distance metric selection during kNN model building. The Naive Bayesian classifier has low computational costs for training and classification. Disadvantages of using SVM algorithm are it requires a lot of memory, long training time for large datasets, and computational complexity. Competitive advantages of the proposed software testing error classification method are the single repository for test results, system integration and deployment on a dedicated server, possibility of automatic analysis of software testing results, creation of custom error types and subtypes for error clustering, test launch history, cross-platform software, the performance of self-tests in real-time demonstration, creation of filters to display only the necessary results, and convenient automation statistics in the form of tables and graphs. The developed software testing error classification method has been integrated into the existing software system through the use of Docker containers. This integration significantly cuts down on the time and human resources needed for error analysis after testing. As a result, project managers and customers can conveniently monitor the status of the project in real time. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Multiswitch excitation can be used to improve the performance of parallel-plate pulse-forming networks (PFNs). Here, we simulate, empirically demonstrate, and show a model for the rise time <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Delta t_{\text{rise}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, output voltage <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\bar{V}_{\text{out}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and pulsewidth <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$T$</tex-math></inline-formula> for a Blumlein-based PFN as a function of switch nodes. Furthermore, unique to this work is the capture of dynamics from fast-switching events and the reactive effects on pulse formation. This work shows that using a distributed switch leads to an output pulse with a shorter <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Delta t_{\text{rise}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, greater <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\bar{V}_{\text{out}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and shorter <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$T$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The improved performance is explained by the pulse being generated along the width of the shared conductor, wherein each current path and its mirror arrive at the load at the same time. IEEE"
"Automating the analysis of chest radiographs based on deep learning algorithms has the potential to improve various steps of the radiology workflow. Such algorithms require large, labeled and domain-specific datasets, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and laborious annotations. Recent advances in generating X-rays from radiology reports provide a possible remedy for this problem. However, due to the complexity of medical images, existing methods synthesize low-fidelity X-rays and cannot guarantee image diversity. In this paper, we propose a diversity-preserving report-to-X-ray generation method with one-stage architecture, named DivXGAN. Specifically, we design a domain-specific hierarchical text encoder to extract medical concepts inherent in reports. This information is incorporated into a one-stage generator, along with the latent vectors, to generate diverse yet relevant X-ray images. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, namely Open-i and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate the high fidelity and diversity of our synthesized chest radiographs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of the generated X-rays in facilitating supervised downstream applications via a multi-label classification task. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"In recent times, with the increase of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), deep learning has brought a dramatic change in the field of machine learning by making it more artificially intelligent. Deep learning is used in various fields because of its wide range of applications such as surveillance, health, medicine, sports, robotics, and drones. In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is at the center of spectacular advances that combine Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and keep updating deep learning strategies. It is used in pattern recognition, sentence classification, speech recognition, face recognition, text categorization, document analysis, scene, and handwritten digit recognition. The goal of this paper is to observe the change of accuracies of CNN to classify handwritten digits using various numbers of the hidden layers and epochs and to see the difference between the accuracies. For this performance evaluation of CNN, we performed our experiment using the Modified National Institute of Standards (MNIS) and Technology (MNIST) dataset. Further, the network is trained using the stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm.

"Users are accustomed to posting their opinions on social platforms, and these text data can be used to analyze users preferences and personality traits. To predict the personality type of users, a user personality prediction model based on sentiment analysis and theme preference is proposed. This work employs latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract different topics of user comments and long-short term memory (LSTM) for text sentiment analysis. Then, the Big Five personality theory is introduced and combined with the text sentiment analysis method. Based on the data of the social event &#x201C;28 years of commutation life&#x201D;, the experimental results show that the accuracy of the sentiment classification on the validation set is 92%. Combined with the Big Five personality theory, the largest proportion of users&#x2019; emotions is &#x201C;anger&#x201D;, accounting for 23%. There are more users with extroverted personalities and neurotic personalities. These conclusions provide information in regard to predicting and controlling the direction of public opinion. IEEE"
"This article tackles the challenging yet significant task of grounding a natural language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The main challenge in visual grounding is to model the correspondence between visual context and semantic concept referred by the language expression, i.e., multimodal fusion. Nevertheless, there is an inherent deficiency in the current fusion module designs, which makes visual and linguistic feature embeddings cannot be unified into the same semantic space. To address the issue, we present a novel and effective visual grounding framework based on joint multimodal representation and interaction (JMRI). Specifically, we propose to perform image-text alignment in a multimodal embedding space learned by a large-scale foundation model, so as to obtain semantically unified joint representations. Furthermore, the transformer-based deep interactor is designed to capture intramodal and intermodal correlations, rendering our model to highlight the localization-relevant cues for accurate reasoning. By freezing the pretrained vision-language foundation model and updating the other modules, we achieve the best performance with the lowest training cost. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets with quantitative and qualitative analysis show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts. © 1963-2012 IEEE."
This article analyses Martin Heidegger’s readings of the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle and is based on the annotations and underlines preserved in a copy that belonged to the German philosopher and is currently kept in the Historical Library of the University of Salamanca. The various handwritten notes and glosses that Heidegger made to Aristotle’s works provide a better understanding of the influence that this book had on Heidegger’s philosophy and reveal that “the historical and philological workshop” that Martin Heidegger set up on the basis of the Aristotelian text was crucial for the development of some fundamental concepts of his thought. © 2023 CSIC.
"On February 23, 2022, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia broke out, shockingthe entire world and creating a heated debate on social media. This paper focuses on understanding the sentiments of Twitter users regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war and classifying them into appropriate categories. In this project, an eight-part dataset was utilized, consisting of various hashtags. Multiple classification techniques were applied, utilizing TF-IDF and Bag of Words vectorization. The dataset consisted of over 1.3 million tweets sourced from Kaggle, with a specific focus on hashtags like 'Russian Troops' and 'Ukrainian War,' among others. Preprocessing steps involved removing symbols and numbers, converting the text to lowercase, and applying stemming. After completing the preprocessing, conducting the analysis, and training the models, an accuracy of 96% was achieved on both the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Visualizing and examining the intellectual landscape and evolution of scientific communities to support collaboration is crucial for multiple research purposes. In some cases, measuring similarities and matching patterns between research publication document sets can help to identify people with similar interests for building research collaboration networks and university&#x2013;industry linkages. The premise of this work is assessing feasibility for resolving ambiguous cases in similarity detection to determine authorship with natural language processing (NLP) techniques so that crowdsourcing is applied only in instances that require human judgment. Using an NLP-crowdsourcing convergence strategy, we can reduce the costs of microtask crowdsourcing while saving time and maintaining disambiguation accuracy over large datasets. This article contributes a next-gen crowd-artificial intelligence framework that used an ensemble of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers to obtain similarity rankings for pairs of scientific documents. A sequence of content-based similarity tasks was created using a crowd-powered interface for solving disambiguation problems. Our experimental results suggest that an adaptive NLP-crowdsourcing hybrid framework has advantages for inter-researcher similarity detection tasks where fully automatic algorithms provide unsatisfactory results, with the goal of helping researchers discover potential collaborators using data-driven approaches.

"Providing human-understandable explanations for the matching predictions is still challenging for current legal case matching methods. One difficulty is that legal cases are semi-structured text documents with complicated case-case and case-law article correlations. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel graph optimal transport (GOT)-based legal case matching model that is able to provide not only the matching predictions but also plausible and faithful explanations for the prediction. The model, called GEIOT-Match, first constructs a heterogeneous graph to explicitly represent the semi-structured nature of legal cases and their associations with the law articles. Therefore, matching two legal cases amounts to identifying the rationales from the paired legal case sub-graphs in the heterogeneous graph and then aligning between them. An inverse optimal transport (IOT) model on graphs is learned to extract rationales from paired legal cases. The extracted rationales and the heterogeneous graph demonstrate the key legal characteristics of legal cases, which can be further used to conduct matching and generate explanations for the matching. Experimental results showed that GEIOT-Match outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in terms of matching prediction, rationale extraction, and natural language explanation generation. IEEE"
"The strength of an adhesive joint is not a property of the adhesive alone but is a system property depending on adherends, the adhesive, the joint geometry, and service (or test) conditions. Most standard test methods specify giving the results as an average stress at failure. Use of this average stress is not very useful in the design and prediction of the strength of other adhesive joints that differ in even slight detail from the geometry of the test specimen. On the other hand, fracture mechanics methods have shown real promise in quantitatively explaining how differences in geometry can alfect joint strength. The effects of modifications of lap specimens, similar to those described in ASTM D3165 ‘Strength Properties of Adhesives in Shear by Tension Loading of Laminated Assemblies’ have been investigated. An earlier paper discussed changes in strength resulting from tapering of the adherends over the overlap region. Here this type of analysis is extended to lap joints in which large debond regions were introduced in the adhesive joint. In both cases, the finite element/fracture mechanics predictions were in good agreement with experimental observations on steel-epoxy lap specimens. Next, a study of failure in cleavage specimens is discussed. ASTM D3433 ‘Fracture Strength in Cleavage of Adhesives in Bonded Joints’ is an ASTM standard whose basis lies in fracture mechanics. This standard makes use of specimens composed of ‘double cantilever beams’ (DCB) bonded together with the adhesive to be evaluated. The equation provided in ASTM D3433, to calculate the adhesive fracture toughness Gic, is based on the equations from mechanics of materials for flexure stress and vertical beam shear stress and assuming ideal cantilever end conditions. This equation, therefore, neglects any energy stored in the adhesive or through rotation of the cantilever end and/or stored in the beam beyond the crack tip (assumed cantilever point). This equation was carefully analyzed using both classical (from the literature) and numerical methods. One would, of course, anticipate that the original assumptions would be most valid for long slender beams and very thin adhesives. Careful finite element/numerical analysis indicates, however, that when using dimensions well within those suggested in ASTM D3433, the energy release rate or Gic determined including these factors can differ by more than 50% from that obtained using the recommended equation. A quasi-elastic adhesive was used with aluminum sheets to manufacture DCB specimens. A group of these specimens were tested to failure and the results used to determine a reference Gic. This G\c was then used with finite element methods to predict performance for test specimens with different geometries, i.e. The adhessive thickness and/or adherend thicknesses were altered. These test results confirmed the validity of the fracture mechanics/finite element approach. The calculated failure loads for the geometries typically differed by no more than 8% from the experimentally determined loads. The results for one sample lot differed by slightly more than 12% from the reference value but, as explained in the text, this difference might be attributed to mode dependence. On the other hand, use of the standard equation with the test results to calculate G]c yielded values that differed by as much as 50% between the different sample geometries. The finite element methods were also used to calculate the energy release rate for various assumed crack paths through the adhesive. It was hypothesized that the fracture locus should follow paths of maximum energy release rate. Experimental observations of crack paths for a number of different geometries of DCBs were consistent with these predictions in every case. © 1998 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Transforming narrative structure to implicit discourse relations in long-form text has recently seen a mindset shift toward assessing generation consistency. To this extent, summarization of lengthy biographical discourse is of practical benefit to readers, as it helps them decide whether immersing for days or weeks in a bulky book turns a rewarding experience. Machine-generated summaries can reduce the cognitive load and the time spent by authors to write the summary. Nevertheless, summarization faces significant challenges of factual inconsistencies with respect to the inputs. In this paper, we explored a two-step summary generation aimed to retain source-summary faithfulness. Our method uses a graph representation to rank sentence saliency in each of the novel chapters, leading to distributing summary segments in distinct regions of the chapter. Basing on the previously extracted sentences we produced an abstractive summary in a manner more computationally tractable for detecting inconsistent information. We conducted a series of quantitative analyses on a test set of four long biographical novels and showed to improve summarization quality in automatic evaluation over both single-tier settings and external baselines. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Automatic detection of fake content in social media such as Twitter is an enduring challenge. Technically, determining fake news on social media platforms is a straightforward binary classification problem. However, manually fact-checking even a small fraction of daily tweets would be nearly impossible due to the sheer volume. To address this challenge, we crawled and crowd-sourced one of the most extensive ground-truth tweet datasets. Utilizing Politifact and expert labeling as a base, it contains more than 180 000 labels from 2009 to 2022, creating five-and three-label classification using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We utilized multiple levels of validation to ensure an accurate ground-truth benchmark dataset. Then, we created and implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including different variations of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based models and classical machine learning algorithms on the data to test the accuracy of real/fake tweet detection with both categories. Then, determining which versions gave us the highest result metrics. Further analysis is performed on the dataset by explicitly utilizing the DBSCAN text clustering algorithm combined with the YAKE keyword creation algorithm to determine topics&#x2019; clustering and relationships. Finally, we analyzed each user in the dataset, determining their bot score, credibility score, and influence score for a better understanding of what type of Twitter user posts, their influence with each of their tweets, and if there were any underlying patterns to be drawn from each score concerning the truthfulness of the tweet. The experiment&#x2019;s results illustrated profound improvement for models dealing with short-length text in solving a real-life classification problem, such as automatically detecting fake content in social media.

"The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text descriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios. Although deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important remote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text descriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on the benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed Txt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing methods. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/Txt2Img-MHN).  © 2023 IEEE."
"Monitoring and tracking mood disorders associated with Menstruation are becoming crucial to avoid impairment in the mental health of a woman, prevent disruption in family life and relationships, and allow women to maintain a proper balance in their work life. Every sentiment linked during the menstruation cycle can be identified for improving fecundability and health management. This study aims to analyze the feelings of women during Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and the actual menstrual cycle using text-mining methods. We used sentimental analysis in a Reddit dataset to identify positive and negative emotions in women. In the proposed framework, public sentiments were first processed and data was balanced using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) followed by classification using different machine learning frameworks like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost Classifier and Boosting Classifier. The findings of this study exhibit that women evoke both positive and negative sentiments. However, compared to other feelings the negative emotion is at its inception. The result shows that Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters gives us the best accuracy of 94% when compared to other baseline and ensemble machine learning models with different feature extraction techniques.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Remote sensing of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is critical in precision agriculture, forest monitoring, and pest management. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the visible and red-edge spectrum areas. However, many multispectral sensors lack red-edge bands. Subsequently, the development of effective visible chlorophyll-related indicators is important. The hue angle defined in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, which reflects the human eye's color discrimination ability relying on visible light (400-700 nm), is introduced in this study for LCC estimation. This study proposes a new multispectral hue angle calculation method employing D65 standard illuminant data, investigates the effect of illuminant factors and band settings on hue angle calculation, and presents tristimulus weight coefficients for calculating MERIS, MSI, and ETM+ hue angles. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the link between LCC and different hue angles, as well as vegetation indices (VIs), is assessed in dense and sparse canopies. The results show that using wavelength-independent illuminant data or discrete bands overcalculates the reflectance-based hue angle. Moreover, our proposed hue angle calculated using D65 standard illuminant data is more sensitive to LCC than the existing hue angle using wavelength-independent illuminant data. In dense canopies, the multispectral hue angle has a stronger relationship with LCC than in sparse canopies. The multispectral hue angle generally appears weaker or similar to the red-edge VIs (MTCI and CI $_{\text {red-edge}}$ ), but stronger than the nonred-edge VIs (CIgreen, NDVI, NGRDI, and TGI). These findings imply that the multispectral hue angle calculated from visible bands provides the potential to monitor the LCC of large-scale plants.  © 1980-2012 IEEE."
"On the study of machine translation, translation system evaluation method is one of the most important links, which plays a very important role in the study of machine translation. Translation quality can be evaluated both manually and by computer. Among them, manual evaluation is a more commonly used means, because it has many advantages. However, there are two problems in the manual evaluation: first, the evaluation takes a long time; second, the manual evaluation will be subjective. In addition, due to the characteristics of machine translation itself, manual evaluation cannot fully meet the needs of machine translators. The automatic evaluation method comes into being, which just fills the defect of manual evaluation. At present, the research on automatic evaluation of machine translation is not deep enough, and the existing automatic evaluation system of machine translation is mostly aimed at a certain type of text test, cannot fully reflect the degree of difference between different texts and the same text in various fields. This paper proposes a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation based on linguistic characteristics. Through analyzing the defects of common automatic evaluation methods such as BLEU and NIST, this method is improved by using regression model of support vector machine, and based on linguistic knowledge, A system for classifying linguistic phenomena or fragments of a sentence from a linguistic perspective. Finally, the experimental results show that the recall rate and accuracy of the automatic evaluation method of machine translation in this paper are 90% and 96%, respectively. Compared with BLEU and NIST two traditional automatic evaluation methods, the automatic evaluation method of machine translation in this paper has a better result.  © 2023 IEEE."
"With the introduction of the European Health Data Space (EHDS), the secondary use of health data for research purposes is attracting more attention. Secondary health data processing promises to address novel research questions, inform the design of future research and improve healthcare delivery generally. To comply with the existing data protection regulations, the secondary data use must be fair, among other things. However, there is no clear understanding of what fairness means in the context of secondary use of health data for scientific research purposes. In response, we conducted a scoping review of argument-based literature to explore how fairness in the secondary use of health data has been conceptualized. A total of 35 publications were included in the final synthesis after abstract and full-text screening. Using an inductive approach and a thematic analysis, our review has revealed that balancing individual and public interests, reducing power asymmetries, setting conditions for commercial involvement, and implementing benefit sharing are essential to guarantee fair secondary use research. The findings of this review can inform current and future research practices and policy development to adequately address concerns about fairness in the secondary use of health data. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Contrary to the denunciation of sexual objectification in the previous waves of feminism, post-feminist ideals invest in celebrating sexual objectification as self-empowerment. Popular and visual media has been a bearer of covert and overt tropes of sexism. This chapter analyses if the Hindi-language soap operas foreground the tenets of fourth-wave feminism within their text to serve as fodder for the male gaze. This chapter performs a Critical Discourse Analysis of the fantasy television fictional series Naagin to deconstruct the possible binaries of sexism in its representations. We argue that these fantasy soaps form the third-phase soap operas in India that exploit the tropes of post-feminist representation through the female protagonist’s body in inherently sexist and misogynistic ways. Prior criticisms of sexism in popular visual culture have been credited to the domination of males in producing and disseminating content for an androcentric audience. This study questions the androcentric production-consumption cycle for neo-liberal gains, despite being owned by a female. Further, it is found that these soap operas use post-feminist cultural sensibilities by hypersexualising the female representation for neoliberal gains. Consequently, they could undo the gains of feminism by equating sexualisation to female agency, thereby relocating the discourse to a pre-feminist world. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Francis Philip Barclay and Kaifia Ancer Laskar; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to extract aspect terms and predict their sentiments with the assistance of visual modalities. The main challenge of existing models lies in the alignment of visual and textual modalities. Recent studies have applied several task-specific supervised methods to enhance the alignment. Nevertheless, the supervised pretraining requires sufficient annotated samples, making it difficult to apply these methods in practice. This paper proposes an entity-related unsupervised pretraining with visual prompts for MABSA. Instead of using sentiment-related supervised pretraining, two entity-related unsupervised pretraining tasks are applied and compared, which are targeted at locating the entities in text with the support of visual prompts. The images are transformed into continuous prompt through a trainable adapter. Based on this, the model is trained to enhance the ability to quickly identify entities (aspects) and thus can reasonably classify the associated polarities with the visual prompts and textual information. The experimental results on two benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines.

"The conditional long text generation is an important yet challenging task especially for some domain-specific applications such as financial report generation. Generally, this emerging financial report generation is to generate long and informative text provided by a piece of short news, where the domain knowledge obviously plays an important role. Apparently, such domain knowledge dynamically varies but could be learned from reports written by human specialists to address multiple viewpoints contained in the original news. To address this issue, this article proposes the mutual information guided financial report generation approach with domain adaption. Particularly, we first extract the underlying domain spaces from the input news as well as their corresponding reports, respectively. Then, these domains are aligned with each other in a mutual manner via the proposed domain adaption component. To further enhance the model performance, the mutual information loss is designed to guarantee the semantic meaning of the generated report is close to that of the input news. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets and the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art model performance. IEEE"
"In recent years, the Internet has tended to speed up the publication of opinions on almost every topic. The volume of published texts results in a huge amount of data that the average Internet user is not able to analyze. At the same time, it can be observed that a very important topic that is becoming increasingly popular on the web is drugs and pharmaceuticals. Taking these two facts into account, we can assume that the customer of websites providing and reviewing medical and pharmaceutical services and products is also becoming a victim of information overload. In this situation, artificial intelligence solutions become helpful. Thanks to modern solutions, an appropriate algorithm is able to perform Opinion Mining, that is, analyze a significant amount of texts, posts and opinions and then aggregate their content into a form suitable for the average person.

SentiNEP method is shown is produce better results for various experiments conducted for the dataset, NEPEduset. Various supervised ML models have been applied for text classification of user sentiment. Word2Vec feature extraction technique has been applied to build and evaluate the models. Performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, F1 score and recall have been used to evaluate the ML models. The results reveal that the support vector machine and random forest classifiers achieve higher accuracy with Word2Vec. The performance results have been compared with VADER, TextBlob and SentiNEP. It has been found that the SentiNEP method produces better results.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Recent scholarship has continued to explore the scholarly publishing gender gap, in which women-identified scholars are shown to publish less than their counterparts identified as men. And yet, studies based on bibliometric data yield results that vary widely, leading some scholars to argue for ethnographic research on academic writing as a situated and gendered social practice to understand why men or women might publish more or less of certain texts in certain contexts (Nygaard & Bahgat, 2018). Working in this vein, this chapter explores gendered discourses and identities in the experiences of two women in the United States working in the field of composition. The analysis in this chapter primarily comes from post-tenure interview data but also draws on insights from data collected when the participants were new PhDs. The overarching gendered discourse that informs these writers’ experiences and decision-making is women serve; my analysis traces how the women serve discourse informs the scholars’ choices while also intersecting with other sociocultural, disciplinary and institutional discourses. While the discourses have not stopped these two women-identified scholars from publishing and advancing in their careers, they nonetheless shape their experiences of publishing and of being academics and take a toll on their well-being. Ways the women resist this discourse are considered. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anna Kristina Hultgren and Pejman Habibie; individual chapters, the contributors."

"Abstractive summarization aims to generate a concise summary covering the input document&#x0027;s salient information. Within a report document, the salient information can be scattered in the textual and non-textual content. However, existing document summarization datasets and methods usually focus on the text and filter out the non-textual content. Missing tabular data can limit produced summaries&#x0027; informativeness, especially when summaries require covering quantitative descriptions of critical metrics in tables. Existing datasets and methods cannot meet the requirements of summarizing long text and dozens of tables in each report document. To deal with the scarcity of available datasets, we propose FINDSum, the first large-scale dataset for long text and multi-table summarization. Built on 21,125 annual reports from 3,794 companies, FINDSum has two subsets for summarizing each company&#x0027;s results of operations and liquidity. Besides, we present four types of summarization methods to jointly consider text and table content when summarizing reports. Additionally, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess the usage of numerical information in produced summaries. Our summarization methods significantly outperform advanced baselines, which verifies the necessity of incorporating textual and tabular data when summarizing report documents. We also conduct extensive comparative experiments to identify vital model components and configurations that can improve summarization results. IEEE"
"The expression of emotions through images is said to be much more effective than via text. Therefore, it is important to develop an image-based model for sentiment analysis. The objective of visual sentiment analysis is to determine how various types of images affect viewers' emotions. Despite the fact that this topic is still relatively young, numerous strategies have been created for a variety of data sources and issues, leading to a substantial body of study. During sentiment analysis, feelings are sorted into optimistic, unpleasant, and unbiased categories. With the aid of machine learning, this work provides an analysis of the most recent advancement, theoretical and practical ideas defining an improvement in sentiment analysis for entertainment applications, specifically on social media. This work aims to focus at latest studies in emoticon-based sentiment analysis and machine learning for review images.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In recent years, the growing demand for medical imaging diagnosis has placed a significant burden on radiologists. As a solution, Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) methods have been proposed to learn universal representations from medical images and reports, benefiting downstream tasks without requiring fine-grained annotations. However, existing methods have overlooked the importance of cross-modal alignment in joint image-text reconstruction, resulting in insufficient cross-modal interaction. To address this limitation, we propose a unified Med-VLP framework based on Multi-task Paired Masking with Alignment (MPMA) to integrate the cross-modal alignment task into the joint imagetext reconstruction framework to achieve more comprehensive cross-modal interaction, while a Global and Local Alignment (GLA) module is designed to assist self-supervised paradigm in obtaining semantic representations with rich domain knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Cross-Modal Fusion (MA-CMF) module to fully integrate visual information to assist report reconstruction and fuse the multi-modal representations adequately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified approach outperforms previous methods in all downstream tasks, including uni-modal, cross-modal, and multimodal tasks. IEEE"
"This is the first book written in English on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the context of European and Italian financial law, introducing the topic with a general overview on the European stage. It is also the first book on European financial regulations of SPACs. As such, it is a groundbreaking reference text for SPAC studies at the international level. Alternative Acquisition Models and Financial Innovation: Special Purpose Acquisition Companies in Europe, and the Italian Legal Framework offers the most comprehensive overview of the current international financial regulations of SPACs in the EU and UK compared to the main legal system where SPACs originated-the US. This edited book is focused on finding a European legal framework for SPACs by discovering whether the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) or the Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) are applicable to them and why, as well as identifying the objectives of financial regulation of SPACs in the EU, US and UK. Essentially, the edited collection explores soft law and self-regulation instances against the state-based Westphalian approaches centred on hard law instances; describes practical examples of SPACs in Italy and Europe; and analyses the limits and perspectives of such investment vehicles on the Italian capital market as well as their possible uses as forms of shadow banking and venture companies at international levels. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Daniele D’Alvia, Ettore Maria Lombardi and Yochanan Shachmurove."
"While texts related to images convey fundamental messages for scene understanding and reasoning, text-based visual question answering tasks concentrate on visual questions that require reading texts from images. However, most current methods add multimodal features that are independently extracted from a given image into a reasoning model without considering their inter-and intra-relationships according to three modalities (i.e., scene texts, questions, and images). To this end, we propose a novel text-based visual question answering model, <italic>multimodal graph reasoning</italic>. Our model first extracts intramodality relationships by taking the representations from identical modalities as semantic graphs. Then, we present graph multihead self-attention, which boosts each graph representation through graph-by-graph aggregation to capture the intermodality relationship. It is a case of &#x201C;so many heads, so many wits&#x201D; in the sense that as more semantic graphs are involved in this process, each graph representation becomes more effective. Finally, these representations are reprojected, and we perform answer prediction with their outputs. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach realizes substantially better performance compared with other state-of-the-art models. IEEE"
"This study focused on science communication on the websites of Czech research institutions. Particularly, we inquired to what extent Czech science is shared with the public on the Internet and what differences can be found between the websites of social and natural science institutions. Textual analysis revealed that on the scientific websites, terms like ‘science’ and ‘popularization’ occurred together with references to scientific institutions, study, and research. In the case of natural sciences, the term ‘popularization’ was more often linked to receiving science awards for science popularization and promotion. Structural web analysis showed that most scientific webs contained hyperlinks to social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Similarly, they often referred to online news outlets such as ceskatelevize.cz, novinky.cz, lidovky.cz, and rozhlas.cz. On the other side, they much less often referred to institutional and government websites. The results suggested that Czech science communication can be characterised as more interactive than canonical. © Authors, 2023."
"Work on emotion detection is often focused on textual data from i.e. Social Media. If multimodal data (i.e. speech) is analysed, the focus again is often placed on the transcription. This paper takes a closer look at how crucial acoustic information actually is for the recognition of emotions from multimodal data. To this end we use the IEMOCAP data, which is one of the larger data sets that provides transcriptions, audio recordings and manual emotion categorization. We build models for emotion classification using text-only, acoustics-only and combining both modalities in order to examine the influence of the various modalities on the final categorization. Our results indicate that using text-only models outperform acoustics-only models. But combining text-only and acoustic-only models improves the results. Additionally, we perform a qualitative analysis and find that a range of misclassifications are due to factors not related to the model, but to the data such as, recording quality, a challenging classification task and misclassifications that are unsurprising for humans. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Rapid advancements in text classification algorithms have kept pace with the exponential rise of digital materials in recent years. In order to automatically extract expressive features, new machine learning algorithms have been suggested that take advantage of recent developments in deep learning techniques. Rapid progress in this area has spawned a multitude of ways for translating human speech into machine-readable data. Ad hoc pre-processing processes are utilized in conjunction with state-of-the-art language modelling algorithms; nevertheless, their presentation is generally glossed over in favor of a more thorough explanation of the classification stage. This work aims at building a model that is used to analyze sentiments, where accuracy is tested by taking data sets of positive and negative movie reviews. Proposed work is divided into 3 tasks: Data Extraction, Preprocessing and Modelling. We have used text classification techniques of Machine Learning by making changes in text vectorization using BOW (Bag Of Words), N-grams and TFIDF and modelling is built using Naïve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that the suggested model provides superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure.

"A fully analog interface circuit based on closed-loop biasing and noise canceling techniques, fabricated in a 130-nm BiCMOS technology, is presented in this letter. The proposed interface circuit is able to precisely bias the sensor and read out the resulting signal in two frequency ranges (low-frequency (LF) range from dc to 375 kHz and high-frequency range from 1 kHz to 130 MHz). In the LF range, thanks to a dedicated noise-canceling technique, the achieved integrated input-referred noise is reduced from 7.3 $\mu \text{V}_{\mathrm{ rms}}$ to 2.8 $\mu \text{V}_{\mathrm{ rms}}$ in the 100-Hz to 1-kHz band and from 14.2 $\mu \text{V}_{\mathrm{ rms}}$ to 4.6 $\mu \text{V}_{\mathrm{ rms}}$ in the 1-100-kHz band, respectively. The fabricated chip features an active area of 1.11 mm2 and consumes 172 mW of power, including the 36 mW required to bias the sensor.  © 2018 IEEE."
"This article examines depictions of natural history museums in a selection of poems and essays drawn from Gillian Clarke’s Zoology (2017), Jane Robinson’s Journey to the Sleeping Whale (2018) and Kathleen Jamie’s Sightlines (2012). These texts present the museum as a place in which we confront extinction through conflicting emotions: a space of care and protection, built on acts of violence. My analysis explores how physical prehension, real or imagined, contributes to mental prehension, and thus helps us to grasp the sixth mass extinction. I examine how metonymical relations connect museums to damaged environments, including zones, like the ocean, that are perceived as sacrifice zones in the making. I contrast Clarke’s sequence of poems ‘Behind Glass’, where ekphrasis connects the beauty of endangered specimens with protected landscapes, to Robinson’s ‘Memories of Flight at the Life Museum’ and Jamie’s ‘Voyager, Chief’ and ‘The Hvalsalen’, which emphasise the collection’s dependence on the depletion of lands and oceans. This leads me to outline two textual approaches to the natural history museum: the first reads the specimen as a synecdoche for endangered, yet protected environments, while the second connects the collection, metonymically and metaphorically, to anthropogenic extinction and sacrifice zones. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Sentiment analysis is a task in natural language processing that focuses on identifying and categorizing emotions expressed in text. Despite the remarkable predictive performance achieved by deep learning models in this domain, their limited interpretability posed a significant challenge. Furthermore, the development of interpretable sentiment analysis models for the Thai language had received inadequate attention. To address this gap, this study proposed a Zero-shot Interpretable Sentiment Analysis Framework, integrating sentiment polarity extraction and leveraging the zero-shot learning with the powerful WangchanBERTa model. Our framework utilized the word selection method from the feeling wheel to represent six primary feelings as sentiment polarities, effectively capturing the subtle emotions expressed in the text. These sentiment polarities played a crucial role as features in training our model, enhancing its interpretability for sentiment analysis tasks. Through the evaluation of three Thai sentiment analysis datasets, we compared the sentiment polarity extraction with two traditional feature extraction methods and ten classification algorithms. The results showed the superiority of the sentiment polarity extraction over Bag of words and its competitive performance compared to TF-IDF in terms of accuracy. To gain insights into the model&#x2019;s decision-making process, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was employed to analyze feature importance. Our findings highlighted the alignment of influential features with the sentiment polarities of the text, providing a crucial understanding of the model&#x2019;s functionality. Notably, we uncovered a clear relationship between specific feeling features and their corresponding sentiment classes, deepening our comprehension of the model&#x2019;s performance in sentiment analysis. This study not only contributed to the advancement of sentiment analysis in the Thai language but also bridged the gap between predictive performance and model transparency, yielding a novel and interpretable approach for sentiment analysis.

"Health-related data are often stored in the form of descriptive documents that are highly unstructured, making it hard for machines to understand. Clinical Natural Language Processing (CNLP) systems retrieve relevant data from unstructured medical narratives, interpret their linguistic features, identify the meaning of biomedical terms, and convert these terms into a form best understood by the machines for clinical decision-making. This research reviews the current CNLP systems, focussing on the various NLP phases and their clinical applications. The existing CNLP systems that capture structured data from the unstructured free text were identified using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. An exclusive survey on numerous NLP techniques for healthcare was carried out to select the popular CNLP systems for extracting clinical terminology from medical narratives. Four research databases were searched using a query integrating NLP and structured data analysis from 2006 to 2021. The literature was narrowed down for each information retrieval system, and the Mendeley software’s “Check for Duplicates” function checked all fields for possible duplicates and eliminated them. A manual scrutinization of the remaining article’s titles and abstracts was performed to acquire the final set of articles. This article gives the basics of NLP, its phases, and applications in the clinical domain and finally reviews the list of popular CNLP systems available for extraction of key medical terms from clinical notes and can be a value addition for the acceleration of research in CNLP systems. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, [Om Prakash Jena, Mrutyunjaya Panda and Utku Kose]; individual chapters, the contributors."
"Since an unprecedented amount of online information in the form of unstructured texts is generated daily, researchers have started to focus on the development of robust mechanisms with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict sentiments. Reliable sentiment classification models can not only avoid the spreading of misinformation but also help people to sieve genuine data by creating fact-checking tools on the user end. The main focus of this work is to investigate the performance of six conventional Deep Learning (DL) models followed by one hybrid DL model in three domains (fake news identification, spam filtering, and cyberbullying detection) of opinion mining tasks by employing efficient deep architectures capable of predicting sentiments even if long sentences are provided. Our empirical results show the rigid performance of all models on a corpus with maximum accuracy of 99.55%, 97.57%, and 93.00% for fake news, spam email, and cyberbullying domains accomplished by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) hybrid, and CNN models accordingly. Our work also exhibits a comparison of compilation times for every model to speed up the training time in this state-of-the-art. Contrary to the previous studies, we have taken long descriptive paragraphs for training purposes with a maximum length of 3336 words in a single sentence. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"Research on electric power systems (EPSs) for the aviation industry has recently grown significantly due to the need to reduce global CO2 emissions from transportation. To fulfill the power requirements of a more electric aircraft (MEA), DC power distribution has emerged as a potential solution. However, the progress of DC distribution faces significant difficulties related to system protection. Solid-state power controllers (SSPCs) are being considered in these applications due to their ability to provide fast-tripping mechanisms for system protection. Although SSPCs have been successfully implemented in low voltage DC 28V aircraft networks, their application in high voltage systems (270 V, ±270 V, or higher) presents challenges, such as over-voltage and excessive power loss, particularly for high-power applications. This paper focuses on the development of SSPCs for a 270 V DC system with a current rating of 125 A / 250 A. The paper presents designs for over-voltage suppression and thermal management of the SSPCs. The study also includes a comparative analysis of using a different number of SiC MOSFET modules connected in series and parallel and their effect on the cooling requirements and circuit temperature to assess power losses, power density, weight, and cooling requirements for the SSPCs. A prototype of the proposed SSPC has been built for experimental validation. Results show effective over-voltage suppression to 480 V and quick interruption capabilities with trip currents of 250 A and 375A within time intervals of 160 ~\mu \text{s} and 300 ~\mu \text{s} , respectively, for line inductance of 105 ~\mu \text{H}. The circuit withstands energy up to 22.5 J for a breaking current of 375 A.  © 2023 The Authors."
"Due to the distributed representation of data through multiple levels of abstraction, one of the most well-liked branches of machine learning recently is “deep learning” (DL). An enormous amount of data is used to power deep learning systems. As huge amounts of data are produced, data analysis becomes increasingly difficult. Traditional Machine Language algorithms struggle to function well when there is a lot of data. Text, images, and other types of data can all be analyzed using deep learning, but deep learning resolves this problem. Deep learning can be used to analyze any kind of data, including text, images, and more. Deep learning, the next stage of machine learning in the last few decades, has revolutionized the way computer vision interprets human-centric content such as images, videos, sounds, and audio. This chapter aims to explain the fundamental deep learning algorithms that drive computer vision applications in the context of healthcare 4.0. The commonly used deep learning algorithms that are best suited for images are Stacked De-noising Auto-encoders, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), deep belief networks, and deep Boltzmann machines. Computer vision analytics with CNNs has many use cases, including recognition image based, detection. This helps in many areas to detect tumors in medical images and recognize their type, or helps robots identify and navigate obstacles. Despite considerable developments in computer vision using deep learning, until now there has been no software library covering these methods in a unified manner. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Nitin Mittal, Amit Kant Pandit, Mohamed Abouhawwash and Shubham Mahajan individual chapters."
"Email communication has grown much in recent decades owing to its low cost, ease of use, speed, and utility across a wide range of content, including online news channels, social media, and political news. Spam messages are an email that is sent to a large number of persons, group discussions, or associations without their consent or knowledge. In the long run, it harms email system usability as it becomes a more destructive component of email traffic. As a result, email systems become sluggish and time-consuming to operate, as well as using a large amount of bandwidth and storage space. Spam may also disseminate harmful and objectionable material on the internet. The feature selection approach is an essential task in text analysis and message categorization, and the use of meta-heuristic algorithms are one of the best approaches. This chapter introduces a novel method for spam message identification using the horse herd optimization technique. The algorithm inputs become opposition-based and then multi-objective as a consequence of this change in structure. Spam identification, a discrete and multi-objective issue, is the final use for this algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed method also performs better than other methods. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Swati V. Shinde, Darshan V.

"This book provides a historical analysis of one of Sigmund Freud’s least-studied cases, published in 1920 as The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman. Scholars of sexuality often focus on Freud’s writings on male homosexuality, disregarding his views on homosexual women. This book serves as a corrective, renewing and reinvigorating interest in Freud, and demonstrating that his views on sexuality are as relevant today as ever. Part I introduces the case and explores Freud’s attitudes towards lesbianism, radical among his medical colleagues in the early twentieth century. It also puts Margarethe Csonka, the patient, at its centre. Michal Shapira considers Freud’s only treatment of a ""female homosexual"" and assesses Csonka’s background life before and after the encounter. Part II expands the case beyond the scientific-medical purview of the times and looks at the new opportunities afforded to women and assimilated Jews through growing equality and the modernization of urban life in 1920s Vienna. This book places Csonka’s case within the broader context of medical and psychological texts, Freud’s own writings, Jewish and queer history, and modern Vienna’s urban and art history. Sigmund Freud and his Patient Margarethe Csonka will be of great interest to psychoanalysts in practice and in training, and to readers interested in the history of gender and sexuality, feminism, modern European and urban history, the history of psychoanalysis, science and medicine, and the history of ideas. © 2024 Michal Shapira."
"The most of the tasks of event extraction from textual data are solved using neural networks. One of the ways to train neural networks on texts is the use of n-grams. In this paper, we consider n-grams in the form of subgraphs of conceptual graphs that have a certain semantics. Each such n-gram can be treated as an event. The paper proposes to use an additional information resource in the form of a hierarchy of multimodal clusters based on a multidimensional formal context, the n+1 dimensional tensor elements of which consist of n-grams and elements selected as objects. The task of event extraction is solved by the joint use of a neural network and a hierarchy of multimodal clusters. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."

"The emerging microblogging service provides a new channel for people to share opinions and sentiment. As a result, microblog sentiment analysis has become a cutting-edge and popular research field, which has many important applications. Existing methods mostly extract sophisticated features from microblog texts without considering that microblogs are networked data, which suffer from poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a new model that assumes microblogs are interconnected and that connected microblogs are more likely to share the same sentiment. We leverage two types of information to model the connections between microblogs: user information and friend information. Our assumption is supported by two sociological theories: sentiment consistency and emotional contagion. The connections between microblogs based on user and friend information are often sparse and noisy, which can limit the effectiveness of sentiment analysis. To mitigate this issue, we use link prediction to identify potential connections between microblogs and introduce a sentiment connection weights matrix to quantify the degree of sentiment difference between connected microblogs. We then integrate potential social links and sentiment connection weights into our content-based sentiment model using a Laplacian regularization term. To demonstrate the effectiveness, sufficient experiments are conducted on two real datasets to show that exploring potential links and introducing sentiment connection weights can improve the performance of microblog sentiment analysis significantly. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Language representation learning is a vital field in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to capture the intricate semantics and contextual information of text. With the advent of deep learning and neural network architectures, representation learning has revolutionized the NLP landscape. However, the majority of research in this field has concentrated on resource-rich languages, putting Low-Resource Languages (LRL) at a disadvantage due to their limited linguistic resources and the absence of pre-trained models. This paper addresses the significance of language representation learning in a low-resource language, Greek, and its impact on various downstream tasks that heavily rely on semantically and contextually enriched language representations. Accurate classification requires an understanding of nuanced linguistic cues and contextual dependencies. Effective representations bridge the gap between raw text data and classification models, encoding semantic meaning, syntactic structures, and contextual information. By leveraging various representation learning techniques using Transformer-based Language Models (LM), such as domain-adaption and contrastive learning, we aim to enhance the performance of text classification in this LRL setting. We explore the challenges and opportunities in developing effective representations and propose a multi-stage LM pre-training and meta-learning approach to improve performance in classification downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on Greek expert-annotated texts from social media posts, news articles, press text clippings and internet articles such as blog posts and opinion pieces. The results show significant improvements in the classification effectiveness of each task in terms of micro-averaged F1-score in sentiment, irony, hate speech, emotion and three custom classification tasks.  © 2013 IEEE."
"The popularity of current communication technologies has boosted the spread of polarization and radical ideologies, which can be exploited by terrorist organizations. Building upon previous research, this work focuses on the task of automatic radicalization detection in texts using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. In this way, we investigate the effectiveness of integrating moral values through the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Moral values play a crucial role in identifying ideological inclinations and can have a significant impact on the radicalization detection task. Our approach distinguishes itself in the feature extraction stage, leveraging moral values, emotions, and similarity-based features that utilize word embeddings. Additionally, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed representations with three distinct datasets that model radicalization and use the SHAP method to gain relevant insight into the models' reasoning.  © 2023 The Authors."

"In recent years, the use of deep learning has contributed to the development of new approaches that outperform traditional methods for many computer vision and document analysis tasks. Many text detection approaches have been proposed and target historical documents, newspapers, administrative documents but also texts in the wild. However, some documents can present complex texts where the shape, the size and the orientation can vary within each word. Onomatopoeia are an example of these complex texts often buried in graphic elements. In this article, we present a study to determine whether the deep learning based text detection methods can tackle such complex texts. First, we selected two well-known deep learning approaches of the literature and then analysed their relevance for the detection of the onomatopoeia. In a second stage, we tried to improve their performance. The experiments show that a simple transfer learning isn’t enough. The models have to consider the characteristics of the onomatopoeia. The proposed strategy show an improvement of about 40% for the detection task of the onomatopoeia. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Numerous research fields have sprung up to study social network sites and their data to obta valuable insights into human behavior and thought patterns. Given the long and illustrious history of leveraging public opinion to inform decisions, sentiment analysis as a subfield of natural language processing must have been covered in several early publications. In fields ranging from regular language handling to AI and information mining to message mining and advertising and even brain science, vast amounts of publicly available datasets are available. While performing a feeling investigation or assessment mining, the information is frequently broken down at many degrees of reflection, such as at the record, expression, and perspective levels. Additionally, research has started to address feeling investigation and assessment mining by utilizing, changing, and extending point display techniques. Point models are probabilistic methods for identifying essential topics in various unstructured texts. This chapter overviews and describes the most recent sentiment analysis methods. The authors introduce the topic of feeling investigation and assessment mining in a brief, pertinent prologue before expanding on it with examples of its use in many fields. A few practical solutions to these problems are developed after examining the significant obstacles to sentiment analysis mining. The authors address the most recent advancements and review these investigations’ results and discuss potential future research options in the concluding section. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Swati V.

"The question of Is it possible to translate the Qur̹ān, which belongs to Allah in terms of order and meaning, into another language? has occupied the minds of Muslims a lot in the modern age. Elmalılı Muhammed Hamdi Yazır (1878-1942), who assumed the duty of interpreting and translating the Qur̹ān in Turkish in the first years of the Republic, also gave wide coverage to this subject in the introduction of the tafsīr. Elmalılı associates the issue with procedural issues by staying away from the political-ideological conflicts of his period and carries the discussion on a scientific basis. In this context, it underlines that translation is based on a multifaceted agreement between the target language and the source language. Although it is seen that it is possible to realize this agreement through tanzīr in literary texts, it is unacceptable to translate divine books that belong to Allah in terms of both order and meaning in this way because what is said in divine books is as important as how it is said. This issue has a special importance for the Qur̹ān. As a matter of fact the i̜jāz feature of the Qur̹ān is more about the way and style of expressing these truths than the truths it contains. This is because in the tahaddī verses, attention is drawn to this aspect of the Qur̹ān and deniers are challenged to bring a likeness of it. As a result, attempts to put forth a word equivalent to the Qur̹ān throughout history have not been successful either in their own language or in another language through translation. Our ultimate aim in this study is to add a new dimension to the discussions on the subject by examining Elmalılı's approach to the issue of translation of the Qur̹ān in terms of order-meaning coexistence. In this context, data collection, text and order analysis methods are mainly applied in the research. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Accurate estimates of downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) are critical for hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological studies, and remote sensing-based estimation of DSSR is an important way to derive DSSR at different spatiotemporal ranges. However, current estimation algorithms usually somewhat rely on atmospheric parameters or in situ measurements, further blocking the application of these methods. Inspired by the emerging DSSR reanalysis data from the model simulation, this study proposed an integrated method by initializing the estimation model with ERA5 reanalysis data and further refining the estimation through iterative training. The random forest regression method was applied in the estimation model to build the connection between DSSR with the MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance, cloud flag, geometry information, elevation, latitude, and coefficient of Sun-Earth distance as input features. To separately consider the impact from cloud cover, the estimation model was established for clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. The proposed method was applied to estimate the instantaneous DSSR of MODIS daytime overpasses in the Southwest part of China in 2020. The comparison between the estimates of the initialized model and the finalized model shows that the iterative process improves the DSSR estimates on both spatial distribution and accuracy. Validated by the measurements from nine sites in the study area, the DSSR estimates of the finalized model show a 0.02 higher correlation coefficient (CC) and 7.35-W $\text{m}^{-2}$ lower root-mean-squared error (RMSE) than that of the initialized model. To better evaluate the performance of the proposed method, three popular DSSR products, including ERA5, MCD18A1, and Himawari-8, were introduced to make an intercomparison with the estimation of this study. The validation results showed that the all-sky DSSR estimated in this study had the best accuracy, with a CC of 0.90, a mean bias error of 37.80 W $\text{m}^{-2}$ , an RMSE of 125.30 W $\text{m}^{-2}$ , and a relative RMSE of 42.73%. Obvious improvements can be observed under cloudy- and clear-sky conditions. Because of the simplicity and reliable performance of the proposed method, it shows good potential for DSSR estimation.  © 1980-2012 IEEE."
"The semantic relations between language and vision modalities become more and more vital since they can effectively facilitate downstream multi-modal tasks. Although several approaches have been proposed to handle language-vision relation inference (LVRI), they normally rely on the limited information of the posted text-image pair. In this paper, to extend the information width of the original input, we introduce a concept of modality translation and propose the auxiliary modality translation framework (AMT) for LVRI. Specifically, the original input and the text pair (original and generated) are passed into two separate multi-layer bidirectional transformer structures respectively. The different linguistic and visual hybrid features are extracted and subsequently feed into a feature fusion module followed by a classifier. Systematic experiments and extensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with auxiliary modality translation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The use of technology (use of social networks through electronic devices) has transformed not only the way online users communicate today, but also the type of relationships traditionally established between sender and receiver in any given communicative interaction. This is especially true in globalized societies, which open the possibility of communication in different languages, modes, and communicative events. This study is grounded in the content analysis of the texts produced on Facebook and Instagram by two foreign students in Madrid universities (Commerce and Architecture), with the purpose of identifying the relationship with their interlocutors, in order to reveal the process of their discursive co-construction identity. Results indicate that texts and images show to their possible receivers a somehow idealized version of their lives as university students in Spain. On the other hand, Facebook and Instagram are revealed as the places where processes link to language learning and the use of different languages, illustrating the possible implications in language teaching contexts. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

"Text-based person search aims to retrieve the most relevant pedestrian images from an image gallery based on textual descriptions. Most existing methods rely on two separate encoders to extract the image and text features, and then elaborately design various schemes to bridge the gap between image and text modalities. However, the shallow interaction between both modalities in these methods is still insufficient to eliminate the modality gap. To address the above problem, we propose TransTPS, a transformer-based framework that enables deeper interaction between both modalities through the self-attention mechanism in transformer, effectively alleviating the modality gap. In addition, due to the small inter-class variance and large intra-class variance in image modality, we further develop two techniques to overcome these limitations. Specifically, Cross-modal Multi-Granularity Matching (CMGM) is proposed to address the problem caused by small inter-class variance and facilitate distinguishing pedestrians with similar appearance. Besides, Contrastive Loss with Weakly Positive pairs (CLWP) is introduced to mitigate the impact of large intra-class variance and contribute to the retrieval of more target images. Experiments on CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods. Our code will be available at <uri>https://github.com/baolp/TransTPS</uri>. IEEE"
"Requirements analysis has always been regarded as the starting point and focus of requirements engineering. The Problem Frames (PF) approach provides a problem-oriented requirements analysis method by describing the software's operating environment in detail. It can effectively bridge the gap between requirements analysis and system design. However, an intuitive and convenient means of elaborating the rich details of complex requirements and their contexts is missing from the literature. Currently, the main methods for describing requirements are through textual descriptions or formal language descriptions, which can result in the PF model containing a large amount of textual representations, and increasing the difficulty and time required for user understanding. In this paper, we present the PF2Detail, a tool that enables fine-grained descriptions of the PF model. Building upon the PF model construction, PF2Detail incorporates multimedia to describe complex requirements in context. Each node in the model can include multimedia, text, or formal language to provide detailed characterizations. Additionally, users can view detailed information about any node in the model and navigate the entire model, aiming to enhance the level of details in the PF model descriptions.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Test data volume (TDV) is the main issue for lessening the test data volume for system-on-a-chip (SoC), lessening test time, average power, and peak power. Several optimization algorithms have been presented previously to decrease the TDV, but none of the algorithm provides sufficient results. To overcome these issues, a novel test data compression technique for CSA using hosted cuckoo optimization algorithm is proposed in this manuscript for lessening the test data volume during fault analysis. The conflicting bits volume is decreased to achieve the ratio of better compression with reduced test application time (TAT) including test data volume. The proposed algorithm achieves fast global searching capability. Hosted cuckoo optimization (HCOA) algorithm is used to find the optimal solution for the constrained problems. The proposed method is executed in MATLAB. The proposed method attains 23.84%, 27.94%, 32.84% higher compression ratio compared with the existing methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"Based on Hilbert Random Secure Distribution, a novel data-hiding method for embedding secret information about the patient in a cover image MRI sample has been proposed. Least significant bit (LSB) and most significant bit (MSB) techniques are applied for the physical hiding. Medical images confidentiality suffers from potential attacks and tracing by an unauthorized access. Technically, distributing the secret text in a random way on the cover image is the core security function of the proposed model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, three quality metrics: Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), percentage residual difference (PRD) and Structural Similarity Index measure (SSIM) were computed and compared on ten MRI images. Experimental results showed significant results in comparison with other models and reached average PSNR up to 61 db. Furthermore, the security analysis in case of 512×512 image samples show complex probability of distribution based on the Hilbert space model. © 2013 IEEE."

"There are text sentiment analysis methods that target a variety of sentiments, such as joy, anger and sadness. This method takes work to perform a highly accurate analysis because creating the dataset is more costly than negative/positive binary targets. Therefore, there is a need for data augmentation in sentiment analysis. Data augmentation in sentiment analysis exists using emojis. By defining the sentiment expressed by emojis, it is possible to automatically annotate a sentiment label to text with emoji. However, conventional methods have a problem in that the definition and weighting of sentiments are subjective. Our method automatically generates training data using emojis and learns it by multi-task learning. This method aims to improve the performance of sentiment analysis by transmitting only helpful information for sentiment analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Background and objectives: To enhance the abilities of healthcare professionals to make informed treatment decisions and establish accurate diagnoses, it is essential to assess the diagnostic reliability of different adjunctive aids. This systematic review aimed to compare the accuracy of various adjunctive methods for diagnosing suspected oral cancer (OC) or potentially malignant oral disorders (OPMD) in adults against histopathological investigative results. Materials and methods: The review protocol registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023463525) was developed in strict accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Diagnostic Test Accuracy checklist. A comprehensive electronic search was conducted to identify relevant research articles published between January 2014 and April 2023 using the PubMed and EBSCO databases. The research question was meticulously structured following the participants’ index test, reference standard, target condition, and study setting framework. To evaluate methodological quality and assess the risk of bias (RoB), the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used. Results: An initial search yielded 483 publications, which were reduced to 278 after removal of duplicates. Finally, 85 publications underwent full-text review by two investigators, which lead to 29 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Among these, 7% had a low RoB, 72% had an unclear RoB, and 21% had a high RoB. Applicability concerns were expressed in 59% of the studies with low concern, 31% with unclear quality evidence of concern, and 10% with high concern. Conclusion: The review findings support the use of these diagnostic methods as valuable adjuncts to biopsy for the early detection of various OPMD and OC. They also highlight the importance of regular screening and awareness in reducing the global burden of OC, while acknowledging that they cannot replace the gold standards of surgical biopsy and histopathological evaluation. © 2023 The Authors"
"Aim: To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at facilitating the transition from full tube to independent oral feeds in premature infants. Methods: Scoping review methodology using the Preferred Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA_ScR). A search of six databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, COCHRANE, and OT Seeker), using keywords related to oral feeding and premature infants retrieved 11,870 articles. Full-text screening was completed for 36 articles, and 21 articles were included in this review. Results: Review of the 21 articles revealed five intervention types: oral stimulation (n = 14), swallow/gustatory stimulation (n = 3), olfactory stimulation (n = 2), tactile/kinesthetic stimulation (n = 1), and auditory stimulation (n = 1). Oral stimulation had the most studies with consistent evidence supporting its beneficial effect to facilitate achievement to independent oral feeds, swallow/gustatory stimulation appeared to have some benefit, but evidence for olfactory, tactile/kinesthetic, and auditory stimulation was sparse. Conclusion: Oral stimulation has the most studies with consistent evidence, and thus is suggested as a suitable early intervention strategy that can be used by health providers to facilitate the achievement to independent oral feeds in premature infants. The alternate forms of stimulation have limited evidence and necessitate further studies to confirm their benefits. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Automatic text summarization (ATS) consists of automatically generating a coherent and concise summary of the original document. It is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with various applications, including news aggregation and social media analysis. The most recent approaches are based on transformer architecture, such as BERT and its different descendants. However, these promising approaches face input length limitations, such as 512 tokens for the BERT-base model. To alleviate these issues, we propose an Optimal Transport (OT) based approach for ATS called OTSummarizer. It represents a sentence by a distribution over words and then applies an OT solver to get similarities between the original document and a candidate summary. We design a Beam Search (BS) strategy to efficiently explore the summary search space and get the optimal summary. We develop theoretical results to justify the use of OT in ATS. Empirically, we evaluate the model on the CNN Daily Mail and PubMed datasets, ensuring a ROUGE score of 41.66%. The experimental results show that the OTSummarizer performs better than previous extractive summarization state-of-the-art approaches in terms of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The Analysis of the Movement of Senses is described as a theoretical and methodological fundamentals for research in education. Initially, the context and the bases are described, to subsequently describe procedures and phases of application of Analysis of the Movement of Senses. In this path, the dialectic perspective, the notions of movement and meaning, always in relation to discourse, are highlighted. For the elaboration of the text, as a kind of metalanguage, the Analysis of the Movement of Senses was applied, producing data through bibliographic research and systematizing them in the meanings that compose the arguments. As every sense is always in motion, the final considerations reiterate the need to understand that, in research in education, there is no absolute end, but a continuous movement of meanings and renewed demands for study. © 2023 Associação Nacional de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa em Educação – ANPEd This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons license."
"Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) is an emerging subtask of aspect-based sentiment analysis, which seeks to predict the sentiment quadruplets of aspect terms, aspect categories, associated sentiment polarities, and corresponding opinion items in one shot. Recent studies employ text generation models to accomplish this task. However, there are still two problems, how to effectively reduce the ASQP task’s high complexity, and the possibility that the generative model may predict explicit terms that do not exist in text sentences. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel text generation model Cartesian-ASQP based on the Transformer architecture. Specifically, this paper simplifies the aspect-based sentiment quad prediction task to a sentiment triple extraction task by performing a Cartesian product operation on the aspect categories and sentiment polarity sets. For sentiment quadruplet text sentences containing pronouns as implicit terms, we present an implicit term processing strategy by semantically mapping these terms back to pronouns. On the output side, for the situation when the explicit aspect/opinion words predicted by the model are absent from input sentences, this paper introduces a two-stage term correction strategy to solve the problem. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms various baseline methods and achieves outperform performance. This work also validates that our proposed model can effectively handle the task of aspect-based sentiment quad prediction with a large number of implicit aspect and opinion terms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

"Various existing vulnerability databases and open-source code platforms have accumulated a large amount of vulnerability information, and extracting vulnerability code samples from this information can help research the causes of vulnerabilities, develop vulnerability detection technologies, and detect potential vulnerabilities. In this work, we collected 13 vulnerability code datasets involving various applications and analyzed these datasets in seven aspects, such as data sources, labeling methods, application scenarios, etc. We found several defects in these datasets, including duplicated data, incomplete information, and inaccurate labels. We also analyzed the extraction and labeling methods of these datasets and proposed three labeling technology frameworks: labeling based on text description, labeling based on patch analysis, and labeling based on vulnerability scanning. The proposed frameworks can be used to evaluate existing labeling methods and guide the future work on labeling vulnerability code samples, which can help form a better vulnerability code dataset. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) brings deep learning from lab with expensive label data costs to real-world commercial application. Today, deep SSL is being universally applied in various artificial intelligence commercial technologies. However, there may be a distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled datasets in practical application, which is a key issue that degrades deep SSL performance. Some recent studies deal with out-of-distribution (OOD) data by directly removing or uniformly reducing weights, which ignore potential value of OOD data. To address the issue, we propose ITSMatch, a simple, safe and effective SSL method to process text classification by recycling OOD data near labeled domain to fully utilize data information. Specifically, a weighted adversarial domain adaptation is applied to OOD data to project it into the space of labeled and in-distribution (ID) data, and its recover ability is accurately quantified by the transferable score. ITSMatch unifies mainstream methods, including pseudo-labels generation and consistency regularization on unlabeled data and its augmented data. Besides, we also perform metric learning on labeled data and ID data with pseudo-labels to fully acquire sample space features. Experiment results on the AG News and Yelp datasets demonstrate that our ITSMatch method performs better than the baseline methods including TextSMatch, MixText, UDA, and BERT. This method of semi-supervised text classification can be applied to the analysis of product reviews on e-commerce platforms to improve customers&#x2019; online shopping experience. IEEE"
"The knowledge of education policy will bring an array of new growth, but it has necessitated an improved type of human–machine intercommunication, in which the machine enhances a thoughtful and interactive intelligence. Natural language processing (NLP), a part of artificial intelligence (AI), is the competence of a computer program to comprehend spoken and written human language (https://www.linguamatics.com/what-text-mining-text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing ; Zhang and Segall in IJITDM 7(4):683–720, (2008)) [1, 2]. After being thoughtful about it, in mining, one should have sagacity for the predetermination of policy (Bhardwaj in Int J Eng Res Technol (IJERT) 1(3), 2012; Maes in Commun ACM 7:30–40, 1994) [3, 4]. Using NLP, this provides a quick way of extracting information about education policy. This paper focuses on manipulating NLP commands after data collection using unstructured interviews about the attitude of NLP and then filling out a website questionnaire form to collect the satisfaction result. Coding is executed to get the required data using Python and NLP. During the analysis of feedback at colleges in Jaipur, Rajasthan, it is divulged about the satisfaction of using NLP commands, so it is observed that NLP creates a convenient way of mining. The goal behind this text mining is to identify the importance of NLPs in getting data into an integrated form. Lastly, in the execution phase, it narrates the process to obtain cognition for extricating data about policies for gratification. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"This paper proposes a novel entitymetrics approach by exclusively focusing on citation sentences. Since citation sentences offer authors’ research interest, knowledge entities that appear in such sentences can be considered as key entities. To characterize such key entities, we focus on citation sentences that were extracted from full-text research articles collected from PubMed Central. We used “opioid” as our search query since it is an actively studied domain, which indicates that rigorous amounts of knowledge entities and entity pairs are available for examination. After which we construct two novel citation sentence-based networks, namely the Direct Citation Sentence (DCS) network and the Indirect Citation Sentence (ICS) network. The DCS network is built upon direct entity pairs that are captured within citation sentences. The ICS network, on the other hand, utilized indirect entity cooccurrences based on cited author information and section information. To do this, we propose a multi-anchor bipartite network that uses cited author information and section headings as a multi-anchor that is related to bio-entity nodes, namely the [author/section]-entity bipartite network. To demonstrate the usefulness of the DCS and ICS network, a conventional full-text network is formed for comparison analysis. In addition, during this process, MeSH tree structure is used to examine the bio-entity level characteristics. The results show that DCS and ICS network demonstrate distinct network characteristics and provide unobserved top-ranked bio-entity pairs when compared to traditional method. This indicates that our method can expand the base of entitymetrics and provide new insights for entity level bibliometrics analysis. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."
"Introduction: The experiences and information needs for reproductive health counseling in women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly defined, despite the known importance of pregnancy planning in this higher-risk cohort. Methods: Australian adult women with CKD and their partners or family members completed a consumer codesigned survey about experiences of and preferences for pregnancy-related counseling, support, and education. Data were analyzed descriptively and with qualitative content analysis of free-text responses. Results: Responses were received from 102 women (CKD, n = 60; dialysis, n = 11; transplant, n = 26; unsure, n = 5 ) and 17 partners/family members. Pregnancy-related discussions were initiated mostly by women themselves (60.0%) compared to nephrologists (26.7%), and only after conception in 14.7%. Women found pregnancy-related discussions satisfactory (68.0%) and useful (50.7%) but also stressful (66.7%), with only 54.7% feeling in control of decision-making. Information deficits and quality, preformed decisions, clinician-patient disconnect, and burden of decision-making contributed to usefulness and outcomes of pregnancy-related counseling. Women received insufficient information about contraception (not provided in 35.2% of cases), medication safety (40.9%), fetal complications (33.8%) and emotional and psychological impact of pregnancy (73.2%). Women preferred counseling from nephrologists (86.4%), face-to-face settings (79.6%), websites (72.7%), handouts (61.4%), and online support groups (46.6%). High-quality, multiformat information by content experts, peer support, and psychological support were also strongly desired. Conclusion: This study highlights that preconception counseling and information needs of women with CKD are currently not being met. Frameworks and tools to assist patients and clinicians, particularly nephrologists, to initiate and conduct sensitive, useful, and informed shared decision-making (SDM) about pregnancy are urgently needed. © 2023"
"A geopolitical clash between Russia and other European powers, the Crimean War (1854– 1856) witnessed the first mediatized armed conflict in modern history. During the war, the young Lev Tolstoy wrote and published three Sevastopol Sketches, based on his wartime experiences in the besieged port of Sevastopol. Upon publication, the first of the stories was translated into French and published within a fortnight. Une journée à Sévastopol en décembre 1854 featured in Le Nord, a Brussels newspaper covertly operated by the Russian government. An in-depth analysis of the translation shows that the text was abridged and carefully groomed to serve Russia’s interests and Tolstoy’s patriotism made way for an appeal to the target audience, designated as ‘happy children of peace.’ Elaborating on the origins of the translation and its publishing context, I argue that this particular translation needs to be read both as an act of soft power and as an act of diplomacy. If the target text is considered as a historical document among other sources, empirical historical research can prove beneficial to the discipline and move forward the debate on Translation Studies’ approach to highly ideological contexts, in particular translations in periodicals. © 2023 Gaëtan Regniers."
"Research-based projects are traditionally targeted at senior undergraduate or postgraduate students. In this paper, we advocate teaching research skills to freshmen rather than older students. Academic writing might be a challenge for university freshmen, especially if their previous learning experience has not involved composing a structured written text that clearly presents the writer’s point of view and supports it with facts and statistics from scholarly sources. The author analyses the problems that freshmen might face in the initial stages of research skills development and offers classroom activities that could help students overcome difficulties related to selecting sources and integrating them into the written text. At the beginning, a brief literature review is presented, which illustrates that the problem of freshmen academic writing has not been researched sufficiently. In the section Discussion, the author shares some examples of activities targeted at solving typical problems that freshmen face while writing research-based papers. For instance, among the suggested activities are those that might help students a) learn to differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources; b) decide on the length of the cited excerpt; and c) make judgements about the relevance of the selected source to the purpose of the research paper. Davidson (2018) referred to course-based research as ‘a new pedagogical paradigm’. The author of this paper supports this opinion and emphasises that such a paradigm should be applied in the earlier stages rather than at the level of PhD or Masters studies, which might yield a significant improvement. © 2023 Sciedu Press.

"Text semantic matching is a fundamental task in natural language understanding, and has a wide range of applications in information retrieval, question and answer systems, reading comprehension, and machine translation. Currently, a better way to do text semantic matching tasks is to extract word vectors or sentence vectors with BERT and then fine-tuning them, but the commonly used fine-tuning methods suffer from the overfitting problem. We propose a bi-directional long short-term memory-parallel dropout model (BiLSTM-PD), which combines word vectors and sentence vectors to improve feature vectors quality and uses parallel dropout to reduce overfitting. First, word vectors and sentence vectors are generated using the pre-trained model, BiLSTM converts the word vectors into sentence vectors, and the sentence vectors generated by BiLSTM are combined with the sentence vectors generated by the pre-trained model to form the final sentence vectors representation; then, four dropout functions are used to randomly discard a portion of the neurons of the sentence vectors to obtain four subsets, and then a linear layer is used to transform the four subsets of dimensionality and calculate the average value, and then use the Softmax and Argmax functions to calculate the predicted value of each batch to know whether the two sentences are similar. Experiments on two text semantic matching datasets and detailed analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Text editing, i.e., the process of modifying or manipulating text, is a crucial step in human writing process. In this paper, we study the problem of controlled text editing by natural language instruction. According to a given instruction that conveys the edit intention and necessary information, an original draft text is required to be revised into a target text. Existing automatically constructed datasets for this task are limited because they do not have informative natural language instruction. The informativeness requires the information contained in the instruction to be enough to produce the revised text. To address this limitation, we build and release WikiIns, a high-quality controlled text editing dataset with improved informativeness. We first preprocess the Wikipedia edit history database to extract the raw data (WikiIns-Raw). Then we crowdsource high-quality validation and test sets, as well as a small-scale training set (WikiIns-Gold). With the high-quality annotated dataset, we further propose automatic approaches to generate a large-scale “silver” training set (WikiIns-Silver). Finally, we provide some insightful analysis on our WikiIns dataset, including the evaluation results and the edit intention analysis. Our analysis and the experiment results on WikiIns may assist the ongoing research on text editing.

"Arguments are ubiquitous. Yet, the definition of what is a good argument depends on the goal, and the settings. Although various business communication studies confirm the crucial role of argumentation, no work has shaped financial argument quality in a way that is concise enough for a practical application. In this paper, we aim to close this research gap by modeling the quality of managers’ arguments, during the Q &A sessions of earnings conference calls. To this end, we propose various quality dimensions at both levels of argument and argument units. Our quality model establishes a well-considered link between, on the one hand, insights as they are expressed in financial text analysis literature, and, on the other hand, insights derived from empirical quality descriptions as provided by argumentation discourse linguistics and computational models. We further conducted the related annotation study and produced FinArgQuality, the first financial dataset annotated with argument quality.

"This study explored the applications of natural language processing techniques on the analysis of storybook to design the storytelling chatbots. Two natural language processing techniques, co-reference and dependency parsing techniques, were applied to process the text of 157 stories books as a means to implement in the invite-narration, positive recognition, follow-up strategies when the chatbot retells the story with the students. The results of the study found that 19 (42%) students demonstrated full narratives which can re-tell the overall story in the storybook, while 22 (49%) students could only retell a simplified story. Affordances and limitations of the use of the two techniques in developing chatbots for reading are discussed.  © 2023 IEEE."

"In a world overwhelmed with news, determining which information comes from reliable sources or how neutral is the reported information in the news articles poses a challenge to news readers. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatically identifying bias by commission, omission, and source selection (COSS) as a joint three-fold objective, as opposed to the previous work separately addressing these types of bias. In a pipeline concept, we describe the goals and tasks of its steps toward bias identification and provide an example of a visualization that leverages the extracted features and patterns of text reuse.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In recent years, due to the increasing popularity of investment microblogging platforms (e.g., Stocktwits), a critical challenge is to detect useful investor opinions and use them to make wise trading decisions. Conventional work in this subject always relies on some human-defined rules or traditional machine learning algorithms. However, the exploration of deep neural networks which have yielded immense success on many real-world applications on detecting useful investor opinions has received relatively few attention. In this paper, we propose DLUIO, a Deep Learning framework to detect Useful Investor Opinions. DLUIO uses a deep neural network to measure the quality of investor opinions by considering author impact, stock characteristics and text information simultaneously. Comparing to previous work depending on human-defined rules to generate features related to authors, stocks or microblog content, DLUIO employs deep neural networks to learn their representations automatically. Moreover, we propose a strategy to generate portfolios by utilizing prediction results obtained by DLUIO. Extensive data analysis and experiments show that DLUIO can bring us high-yield portfolios. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Recently, behavioral biometric-based user authentication methods, such as keystroke dynamics, have become a popular alternative to improve security of online platforms, due to their non-invasive nature. However, currently there are very few behavioral biometric authentication methods that provide non-invasive continuous user authentication for online education platforms, resulting in frequent network intrusion and online assessment fraud. Existing approaches mostly analyze the typing behavior of users using a fixed sequence of characters. Furthermore, a better set of features are required to reduce false positive rate for satisfactory performance to prevent online fraud. Existing behavioral analysis methods also mostly rely on conventional machine learning approaches despite recent advancement in deep learning approaches. We identify a set of keystroke behavioral biometric features that yield satisfactory performance by identifying most frequently used features. We also collect new free-form keystroke behavior data during online assessment activities and develop non-invasive continuous authentication methods for free-form text behavior analysis using deep learning approaches. We also compare performance between deep learning and conventional machine learning approaches and evaluate the robustness of the most frequently used features. Result analysis shows that deep learning approaches outperform machine learning approaches on most frequently used feature set. Furthermore, it is found that the identified feature set is robust and results in satisfactory performance in deep learning approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"As the government in China attaches importance to AI education, the K-12 Robot Education Industry, which plays a fundamental role in AI education, has formed a huge demand for teachers. However, the number of teachers trained by the colleges and universities in China is still insufficient recently. To better improve the Robot Education Teachers' professional curriculum system and content design, it is necessary to understand the competency structure of robot education teachers. In this study, the authors adopted the content analysis method combining quantitative statistics and qualitative analysis to confirm the competency of robot education teachers. They crawled the recruitment data (N=445) from a famous recruitment Website with a self-developed crawler, then constructed a 'Professional Task Capability-Professional Knowledge and Skills-Professional Quality' K-12 Robot Education Teacher Competency Model through the analysis and text coding based on the grounded theory. A survey was conducted on in service teachers in educational institutions in Guangdong Province (N'=119) to verify the reliability of the model constructed. The results showed that 97.5% of them acknowledged the Competency Model. Based on the research results, the authors give some suggestions for colleges and universities to improve the training of robot education teachers.  © 2023 IEEE."

"The purpose of this research is to analyze the textual source attributes of explanations and reviews about comics. Comics are difficult to process in terms of the intended story because they are primarily composed of pictures and text. One of the processing methods is to analyze comics text on the Web, particularly the description of characters and reviews including the reader’s impression about the comic. Sources of textual information, such as explanations or reviews, are selected according to the application of the study. However, differences among textual sources regarding comics are not taken into consideration in the analysis. This paper classifies words appearing frequently in the text semantically, with results showing that explanations include words that express the story, for example, the family structure, physical information, and sex of the characters for describing the characters. Conversely, the review frequently uses words that provide meta-information about comics, such as illustrations and style. The proposed method revealed that explanations of comics are more useful as textual sources for analyzing story information than reviews. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"In this research paper, the focus is predominantly set on the sentiment analysis of a Twitter tweet dataset generated by python script related to the Russia-Ukraine war. The data was analyzed and studied using the RoBERTa model, a deep learning model based on transformers. We classify tweets under this dataset into three parallels: Negative, Positive and Neutral based on the sentiment scores assigned by the model. The findings suggest that the majority of users on Twitter hold negative views towards the conflict, which elucidates the importance of considering the impact of social media on public perception of current events. The trend also follows when we bifurcate the tweets into their respective months. This research paper contributes to the ever-growing field of sentiment analysis and has dwelled deep into the process of how the dataset was generated and how RoBERTa classifies a highly engaged topic consisting of a plethora of sentiments.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Conventional wisdom on India’s nuclear geopolitics takes a top-down approach, foregrounding state perceptions of India’s nuclear role in regional and global politics. This conventional approach overlooks the bottom-up processes, such as media representations, which have been fundamental in shaping India’s nuclear identity. This is because media representations comprise common-sense knowledge, since media is the primary source of information in a democracy. Building on theoretical underpinnings of popular geopolitics, this article focuses on analyses of media representations in the Editorial of the English daily The Hindu from 2011–2020. This national newspaper boasts the second-largest readership among English dailies. The direct link between The Hindu Editorial’s representations of ‘nuclear India’ and India’s ‘regional’ and ‘global’ selfhood is crucial. The concerned period of 2011–2020 was pivotal in charting Indian geopolitical identity, as India partook in international negotiations after the US-India Nuclear Deal in 2008 and became a member of multilateral export control regimes like the Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group, and Missile Technology Control Regime. This article deconstructs the Editorial texts to elicit the intertextual links underpinning the ‘geopolitical cultural signifier’, ‘geospatial mythology’, and ‘self/other’ binary representation that operationalises India’s nuclear identity in regional and global settings. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Masked image modelling (MIM)-based pre-training shows promise in improving image representations with limited annotated data by randomly masking image patches and reconstructing them. However, random masking may not be suitable for medical images due to their unique pathology characteristics. This paper proposes Masked medical Image Modelling (MedIM), a novel approach, to our knowledge, the first research that masks and reconstructs discriminative areas guided by radiological reports, encouraging the network to explore the stronger semantic representations from medical images. We introduce two mutual comprehensive masking strategies, knowledge word-driven masking (KWM) and sentence-driven masking (SDM). KWM uses Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) words unique to radiology reports to identify discriminative cues mapped to MeSH words and guide the mask generation. SDM considers that reports usually have multiple sentences, each of which describes different findings, and therefore integrates sentence-level information to identify discriminative regions for mask generation. MedIM integrates both strategies by simultaneously restoring the images masked by KWM and SDM for a more robust and representative medical visual representation. Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering multi-label/class image classification, medical image segmentation, and medical image-text analysis, demonstrate that MedIM with report-guided masking achieves competitive performance. Our method substantially outperforms ImageNet pre-training, MIM-based pre-training, and medical image-report pre-training counterparts.

"Falls are a common problem associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. Current fall prevention policies in local healthcare settings are often guided by information provided by fall risk assessment tools, incident reporting, and coding data. This review was conducted with the aim of identifying studies which utilized natural language processing (NLP) for the automated detection and prediction of falls in the healthcare setting. The databases Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Emcare, PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and Ei Compendex were searched from 2012 until April 2023. Retrospective derivation, validation, and implementation studies wherein patients experienced falls within a healthcare setting were identified for inclusion. The initial search yielded 2611 publications for title and abstract screening. Full-text screening was conducted on 105 publications, resulting in 26 unique studies that underwent qualitative analyses. Studies applied NLP towards falls risk factor identification, known falls detection, future falls prediction, and falls severity stratification with reasonable success. The NLP pipeline was reviewed in detail between studies and models utilizing rule-based, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid approaches were examined. With a growing literature surrounding falls prediction in both inpatient and outpatient environments, the absence of studies examining the impact of these models on patient and system outcomes highlights the need for further implementation studies. Through an exploration of the application of NLP techniques, it may be possible to develop models with higher performance in automated falls prediction and detection.  © 2023 The Author(s).

"[Context] Software with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is used in everyday life. Users expect working software when they interact with a software product. For this reason, testing and defect corrections are required. However, understanding GUI tests is challenging, as the generated textual test reports lack the dynamic details about interaction steps to reproduce a GUI defect. [Objective] We want to revise the practice of GUI testing and use videos as a by-product to capture and convey these dynamic details. [Method] Based on the video as a by-product approach, we propose to generate videos as a by-product of GUI testing, integrating annotations and test outputs directly into the videos. These videos serve as supplementary material for documenting dynamic test executions in addition to static test reports (e.g., texts, screenshots). In an experiment, we asked 11 participants to distinguish between true and false defects in watching videos and screenshots of four test cases. We also conducted structured interviews to ask the participants about their opinions for these two documentation options. [Results & Conclusion] Our results show visible differences between the video and the screenshots in effectiveness and efficiency in defect analysis, but cannot prove the differences statistically. The listed advantages and disadvantages of both documentations are complemental. Both documentations are helpful and thus videos as a by-product of GUI testing can foster the understanding of GUI tests.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Privacy policies disclose how an organization collects and handles personal information. Recent work has made progress in leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to automate privacy policy analysis and extract data collection statements from different sentences, considered in isolation from each other. In this paper, we view and analyze, for the first time, the entire text of a privacy policy in an integrated way. In terms of methodology: (1) we define POLIGRAPH, a type of knowledge graph that captures statements in a privacy policy as relations between different parts of the text; and (2) we develop an NLP-based tool, POLIGRAPH-ER, to automatically extract POLIGRAPH from the text. In addition, (3) we revisit the notion of ontologies, previously defined in heuristic ways, to capture subsumption relations between terms. We make a clear distinction between local and global ontologies to capture the context of individual privacy policies, application domains, and privacy laws. Using a public dataset for evaluation, we show that POLIGRAPH-ER identifies 40% more collection statements than prior state-of-the-art, with 97% precision. In terms of applications, POLIGRAPH enables automated analysis of a corpus of privacy policies and allows us to: (1) reveal common patterns in the texts across different privacy policies, and (2) assess the correctness of the terms as defined within a privacy policy. We also apply POLIGRAPH to: (3) detect contradictions in a privacy policy, where we show false alarms by prior work, and (4) analyze the consistency of privacy policies and network traffic, where we identify significantly more clear disclosures than prior work. © 2023 32nd USENIX Security Symposium, USENIX Security 2023.

"Requirements modeling is a crucial tool for requirements analysis and has been demonstrated to aid in the comprehension and analysis of requirements. However, constructing requirements models from natural language descriptions in user requirements documents can be a time-consuming task. With the growing attention given to large language models, they have become an integral component of natural language processing. Consequently, utilizing large language models to facilitate the construction of high-quality requirement models is appealing. This paper presents an automated framework for requirement model generation that incorporates ChatGPT-based zero-shot learning to extract requirement models from requirement texts and subsequently compose them using predefined rules. The framework defines the requirement extraction task of ChatGPT by designing appropriate prompt, and it generates requirement models by employing composition rules. Furthermore, a case study on a digital home system is conducted to validate the feasibility of the framework in assisting requirements modeling.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Using real working documents as a basis for research, the aim of this paper is to compare the lexical accuracy of bilingual dictionaries versus machine translation engines that apply neural networks, when employed by non-professionals to translate texts. We put three such machine translation engines to the test (Google Translate, Bing Microsoft Translator and DeepL), and evaluate their performance when translating a selection of real working documents. We focus particular attention on lexical errors originated by machine translation engines that compromise the reader’s understanding of the final text. Finally, we compare the results obtained for the same tasks when making use of bilingual dictionaries in place of MT engines. The conclusion reached is that when translating reasonably complex texts, the output generated by MT engines is unsatisfactory: lexicographic data obtained from sundry bilingual dictionaries online generally offers more precise and comprehensive lexicographic information to satisfy the user’s communicative needs. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

"With the advancement of technology in the modern society, there is also a need for an advance security system. The public-key encryption known as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is considered to be more secure than traditional methods such as Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) for the same key size. In ECC, a key pair is generated by selecting a point on an elliptic curve and a secret integer, called the private key. In this research, we proposed an ECC-based chaotic map text encryption scheme. A chaotic sequence is generated where BitXoR is performed with the input ASCII characters. The XoRed data is grouped, and ECC is performed to each group to generate the cipher text. The chaotic system provides better randomness while ECC provides efficient security. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method can efficiently encrypt and decrypt the input text data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task is one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) research fields that has seen considerable scientific advancements over the last few years. This task aims to detect, in a given text, the sentiment of users towards the different aspects of a product or service. Despite the big number of annotated corpora that have been produced to perform the ABSA task in the English language, resources are still stingy, for other languages. Due to the lack of French corpora created for the ABSA task, we present in this paper the French corpus for the mobile phone domain “FreMPhone”. The constructed corpus consists of 5217 mobile phone reviews collected from the Amazon.fr website. Each review in the corpus was annotated with its appropriate aspect terms and sentiment polarity, using an annotation guideline. The FreMPhone contains 19257 aspect terms divided into 13259 positives, 5084 negatives, and 914 neutrals. Moreover, we proposed a new architecture “CBCF” that combines the deep learning models (LSTM and CNN) and the machine learning model CRF and we evaluated it on the FreMPhone corpus. The experiments were performed on the subtasks of the ABSA: Aspect Extraction (AE) and Sentiment Classification (SC). These experiments showed the good performance of the CBCF architecture which overrode the LSTM, CNN, and CRF models and achieved an F-measure value equal to 95.96% for the Aspect Extraction (AE) task and 96.35% for the Sentiment Classification (SC) task. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"In the field of Computer Science, conference and workshop papers serve as important contributions, carrying substantial weight in research assessment processes, compared to other disciplines. However, a considerable number of these papers are not assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), hence their citations are not reported in widely used citation datasets like OpenCitations and Crossref, raising limitations to citation analysis. While the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) previously addressed this issue by providing substantial coverage, its discontinuation has created a void in available data. BIP!

"Background: The detrimental effects of hyperoxia exposure have been well-described in patients admitted to intensive care units. However, data evaluating the effects of short-term, early hyperoxia exposure in patients intubated in the prehospital setting or emergency department (ED) have not been systematically reviewed. Objective: Our aim was to quantify and describe the existing literature examining the clinical outcomes in ED patients exposed to hyperoxia within the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. Methods: This review was performed in concordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for scoping reviews. Two rounds of review using Rayyan QCRI software were performed for title and abstract screening and full-text search. Of the 2739 articles, 27 articles were retrieved after initial screening, of which 5 articles were excluded during the full-text screening, leaving 22 articles for final review and data extraction. Results: Of 22 selected publications, 9 described patients with traumatic brain injury, 6 with cardiac arrest, 3 with multisystem trauma, 1 with stroke, 2 with septic shock, and 1 was heterogeneous. Three studies were randomized controlled trials. The available data have widely heterogeneous definitions of hyperoxia exposure, outcomes, and included populations, limiting conclusions. Conclusions: There is a paucity of data that examined the effects of severe hyperoxia exposure in the acute, post-intubation phase of the prehospital and ED settings. Further research with standardized definitions is needed to provide more detailed guidance regarding early oxygen titration in intubated patients. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Background: Maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care is a multidimensional assumption of satisfaction with self and with the physical environment of the delivery ward and quality of care. Maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care affects the selection of birthplace and helps to identify gaps between actual and intended healthcare outcomes. This study aims to assess factors that affect maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care. Objectives: To assess maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care and associated factors among mothers who gave birth in public hospitals in the South-west Shewa Zone, Ethiopia, 2022. Methods: A cross-sectional study approach among 420 mothers was conducted between April 14 and June 14, 2022. Systematic random sampling was used to select mothers for face-to-face interviews every two intervals. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out. P-values of <0.25 in association with study variables were transferred to multivariable logistic regression models. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was computed, and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant in the multivariable model. The results of this study are presented using text, tables, and charts. Results: Data were collected from 420 participants, and 413 mothers completed the interview, giving a response rate of 98.33%. The overall maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care was 245 (59.32%) [95% CI: 55–64]. Mothers who were considered normal during labor and delivery (AOR = 2.57 (95% CI: 1.30–5.07), had a labor duration of 12 h or less (AOR = 1.59 (95% CI: 1.03–2.44), and experienced a waiting time of <15 min (AOR = 2.06 (95% CI: 1.21–3.52) were significantly associated with maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care. Conclusion and Recommendations: More than half of mothers were satisfied with the overall intrapartum care they received. Health facility managers and healthcare providers work together to improve maternal satisfaction with intrapartum care. 2023 Tolesa, Alemu, Beya, Feyisa, Gezahagn, Negash, Shigign, Getaye, Negash and Merga."
"A rapid growth of using special intelligent systems in applied tasks has recently been observed in such an area of artificial intelligence as the joint processing of data from different modalities. In other words, in order to obtain more accurate predictions in artificial general intelligence, multimodal processing must be present. The study is devoted to solving the problem of classifying images containing data with text. A complex analysis model is proposed, which includes such steps as text extraction, image processing, text preprocessing, text processing, prediction integration. An important advantage of the multimodal model was an increase in classification efficiency by 5–8% compared to homogeneous information processing approaches. The problem of partitioning into 3 classes is considered, for which an accuracy metric of 86% was achieved. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Financial sector and especially the insurance industry collect vast volumes of text on a daily basis and through multiple channels (their agents, customer care centers, emails, social networks, and web in general). The information collected includes policies, expert and health reports, claims and complaints, results of surveys, and relevant social media posts. It is difficult to effectively extract labels, classify, and interpret the essential information from such varied and unstructured material. Therefore, the Insurance Industry is among the ones that can benefit from applying technologies for the intelligent analysis of free text through Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, CRL+, a novel text classification model combining Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) and Active Learning is proposed to handle the challenge of using semi-supervised learning for text classification. In this method, supervised (CRL) is used to train a RoBERTa transformer model to encode the textual data into a contrastive representation space and then classify using a classification layer. This CRL-based transformer model is used as the base model in the proposed Active Learning mechanism to classify all the data in an iterative manner. The proposed model is evaluated using unstructured obituary data with objective to determine the cause of the death from the data. This model is compared with the CRL model and an Active Learning model with the RoBERTa base model. The experiment shows that the proposed method can outperform both methods for this specific task. © 2023 by the authors."

"The analysis of African feminism in literary works is now a well-established area in literature. Most of the research on Changes and Faceless focuses on a thematic or stylistic study of the text. An often-underexplored area is how these two authors utilize the element of characterization to (re)inscribe the boundaries of African-centered feminist identities. To fill this gap, this article comparatively analyses the portrayal of “feminist” identity in Aidoo’s Changes (1994) and Darko’s Faceless (2003). The article reaffirms the stance assumed by Nigerian theorists like Nnaemeka, Ogundipe-Leslie, and Akachi that the feminist in Africa is accommodative, compromising, and collaborative. Using negofeminism (No ego feminism) theory as an analytical framework, this article reveals that in Faceless, the female characters who survive and thrive are those who live out the very tenets of the theory. In Changes, Esi is isolated in the end because she chose individualism over communalism. Consequently, this article extends the scholarship on literary representation of African feminism in women-authored novels. This validates the conclusion that African feminism as portrayed by Aidoo and Darko is truly representative of indigenous societies.

"As the first session-level Chinese dataset, CHASE contains two separate parts, i.e., 2,003 sessions manually constructed from scratch (CHASE-C), and 3,456 sessions translated from English SParC (CHASE-T). We find the two parts are highly discrepant and incompatible. In this work, we present SeSQL, a high-quality large-scale session-level Chinese text-to-SQL dataset, consisting of 5,028 sessions all manually constructed from scratch. Compared with previous datasets, in order to guarantee data quality, we adopt an iterative annotation workflow to facilitate intense and in-time review of previous-round natural language (NL) questions and SQL queries. Moreover, by completing all context-dependent NL questions, we obtain 27,012 context-independent question/SQL pairs, allowing SeSQL to be used as the largest dataset for single-round text-to-SQL parsing. We conduct benchmark session-level text-to-SQL parsing experiments on SeSQL via employing three competitive session-level parsers, and present detailed analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"In the wake of information overload in academia, methodologies and systems for search, recommendation, and prediction to aid researchers in identifying relevant research are actively studied and developed. Existing work, however, is limited in terms of granularity, focusing only on the level of papers or a single type of artifact, such as data sets. To enable more holistic analyses and systems dealing with academic publications and their content, we propose CoCon, a large scholarly data set reflecting the combined use of research artifacts, contextualized in academic publications' full-text. Our data set comprises 35 k artifacts (data sets, methods, models, and tasks) and 340 k publications. We additionally formalize a link prediction task for 'combined research artifact use prediction' and provide code to utilize analyses of and the development of ML applications on our data. All data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/IllDepence/contextgraph.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a multidisciplinary field that aims to predict sentiment tone or attitude expressed in a text, SA using social media data has become a popular topic especially during critical events such as natural disasters, social movements and recently the spread of the Coronavirus Pandemic. Sentiments can be expressed explicitly or implicitly in text and identifying these expressions can be challenging. SA in Tunisian dialect is particularly difficult due to the complexity of the language, its morphological richness and the lack of contextual information. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been widely adopted in the field of SA, especially in the context of Arabic SA. These models, such as Bi-directional LSTM networks (Bi-LSTM) and LSTM networks, have shown to achieve high accuracy levels in sentiment classification tasks for Arabic and dialectical text. Despite the successes of DL models in Arabic SA, there are still areas for improvement in terms of contextual information and implicit mining expressed in different real-world cases. In this paper, the authors introduce a deep Bi-LSTM network to ameliorate Tunisian SA during the spread of the Coronavirus Pandemic. The experimental results on Tunisian benchmark SA dataset demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over the state-of-art DL models and the baseline traditional machine learning (ML) methods. We believe that this contribution will benefit anyone working on Tunisian pandemic management or doing comparative work between Tunisian and other jurisdictions, which can provide valuable insights into how the public is responding to the crisis and help guide pandemic management decisions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The International Classification of Diseases Eleventh Edition (ICD-11), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), now include prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Since criteria for PGD in both classification systems differ from prior proposed grief disorders and each other, the validation of a single instrument to screen for prolonged grief (PG) symptoms of both new diagnoses is critical for bereavement research and care. Therefore, we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the Traumatic Grief Inventory Self-Report Plus (TGI-SR+). Two-hundred and forty-eight bereaved parents completed questions about sociodemographic and loss-related variables, the TGI-SR+, and symptom measures of post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression and an older measure of PG symptoms, the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 (PG-13). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a one-factor model best fit DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 PG symptoms and the analyses of the internal consistency and inter-item correlations showed that these symptoms could be reliably assessed. In support of convergent validity, DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 PG symptoms correlated with symptoms of PTS, depression and PG assessed with the PG-13. In support of known-groups validity, DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 PG symptoms were higher among lower educated (vs. higher educated) participants and related negatively to time since loss. ROC analyses showed optimal cut-off score of ≥71 and ≥72 to determine probable caseness for DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 PGD, respectively. Results support the reliability and validity of the Swedish TGI-SR+ as a screening instrument for PG in research and bereavement care. © 2023 The Authors.

"Education offers the younger ones an inheritance of knowledge and experiences, however, with the crisis of tradition, the relationship of the new generations with this legacy becomes problematic, either because it has lost its legibility or because it is seen as outdated. This paper argues that, despite this, it is up to the heirs to read, interpret and re-signify this imperfect inheritance. In this perspective it is questioned, on the one hand, if the attempt to appropriate this legacy can cause transformations in the supposedly ended past, and, on the other hand, to what extent this inheritance affects those who are involved with it. The starting point for this reflection is Hannah Arendt’s thought on education, in particular, the essay “The crisis in education” and Paul Ricoeur’s work Time and narrative, in particular his approach to reading in the context of mimesis III. The act of reading, according to the philosopher, is characterized by a dialectic that causes transformations in the narrative and in the reader. Does this transforming mimetic movement between reader and text also occur in the dynamics between heirs and inheritance, which is at the heart of the formation of young people and children? Based on this question, the paper seeks to establish a dialogue between Ricoeur‘s analysis of reading and the reflection on the task of education, according to Arendt, of inviting the youngest “to read” the inheritance of a world that precedes them. © (2023).

"Data mining from textual sources is known as social media text analytics. Social media, like any other text-based dataset, is amenable to text analysis. Today’s society has a huge challenge in the form of crime, with the routes of which having shifted almost entirely to social media. Because of crime, both the standard of living and economic development have suffered. By sifting through the available data, we may identify trends in criminal behaviour and foresee potential incidents in the future. Unfortunately, not all crimes are recorded or solved due of a lack of evidence. Hence, tracking these offenders remains challenging. We can keep an eye on illicit activities on social media. For the simple reason that social media users sometimes make observations about their immediate environment. In this study, we propose a model for crime categorization on a Twitter dataset that combines the recently proposed Capsule Network with the tried-and-true Multilayer Perceptron. The output of both networks is combined in a manner that makes the most of each network’s strengths using a rule-based technique. Moreover, the Criss-Cross Optimization (CCO) method is used to fine-tune the capsule network’s hyper-parameters. Crime statistics from reliable sources are used to make accurate comparisons between regions. We also evaluate recent changes in crime rates in both Jammu, India, and Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The most recent crime patterns during the last week have been documented (23, January 2019 to 30, January 2019). The studies show that the generated findings are consistent with the actual crime rate information. We anticipate that research of this kind will aid in gauging the current crime rate in various areas and in identifying criminal activity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"With the widespread use of new information technology, calls have been made for leadership training research to examine if the effects of leadership training can be boosted over time by sending text messages or e-mails, in order to reinforce the lessons learned in training interventions. Based on media synchronicity theory (MST), the purpose of the current study was to contrast the usefulness of two booster activities: traditional telephone coaching, and exercises sent by e-mail. Managers were randomly assigned to one of the two booster conditions. We then used a mixed methods design including both quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the boosters. We obtained the quantitative data from 20 managers and their 323 employees at four time points: before, during, and after the training. We also used focus group interviews to evaluate managers’ experience of both booster activities. The quantitative analyses indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups after the second session, where managers in the e-mail group scored higher on readiness for change and perceived applicability of the training. The latent growth curve analyses indicated a statistically significant increase in employees’ perception of managers’ autonomy support. The qualitative data suggest that the e-mail booster was considered informative and flexible but also time consuming, while the telephone coaching was perceived as flexible but somewhat unstructured. Our findings suggest that an e-mail booster could be a cost-effective alternative to reinforce lessons learned in leadership training. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The task of named entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to natural language processing (NLP), as it forms the basis for various downstream applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. With the development of Transformer architecture, it has gained popularity in NLP due to its ability to model parallel distant contextual dependencies. Although positional encoding is crucial in transformer-based NER models for capturing the sequential feature of natural language and improving their accuracy in NER, most approach, which uses a fixed mathematical formula to assign a unique vector to each position, is a hard-coded encoding To address this issue, a self-adapted positional encoding module called self-adapter is proposed in a Transformer model. The proposed self-adapter incorporates two information fusers aimed at enhancing the embedding representational ability of the model. The first information fuser integrates information across different positions, enhancing the embedding representational ability for different ranges. The second information fuser integrates diverse dimensional information for one position, resulting in improved embedding representation. Besides, We modify the calculation of the attention score to enhance the utilization of the self-adapter. A mathematical analysis based on Fourier series is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This approach allows for dynamic positional encoding adjustment, facilitating adaptation to varying contextual inputs and more flexibility to capture word relationships. To evaluate the model, four NER datasets, including one English and three Chinese datasets, are used. The results show that the self-adapter substantially improves the Transformer’s performance in the NER task. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Purpose: The objective of this scoping review is to understand the extent, type of evidence, and overall findings in relation to the impact of endoscopic treatment (ET) on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in patients with Barrett’s dysplasia and early oesophageal cancer. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted for literature between 2001 and 2022 in computerised databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL Complete). Additionally, sources of unpublished literature were searched in Google Advanced Search. After title and abstract checking, full-text papers were retrieved. Data were extracted, synthesised, key information tabulated, and a narrative synthesis completed. Results: Six studies were included in the final analysis. Twelve different survey tools were utilised across all studies. Study designs included three randomised controlled studies, two prospective observational studies, and a single retrospective observational study. The average age of study participants ranged from 60.3 to 71.0 years. Two studies evaluated HR-QoL as primary outcome measures, but most research evaluated HR-QoL as a secondary outcome. Health domains evaluated in the studies focussed on the biophysical and psychosocial aspects of quality of life. Conclusion: A small number of research studies have been conducted in this area. Due to the heterogeneity and small number of included studies, it was difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of specific ET types on HR-QoL. Overall, there were perceived psychological benefits while undergoing ET. Future research could target specific ET subtypes and measure HR-QoL at baseline and post-procedures in the short and long term. © 2023, Crown."

"Introduction: Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a core pillar of cancer therapy as single agents or in combination regimens both in adults and children. Unfortunately, ICIs provide a long-lasting therapeutic effect in only one third of the patients. Thus, the search for predictive biomarkers of responsiveness to ICIs remains an urgent clinical need. The efficacy of ICIs treatments is strongly affected not only by the specific characteristics of cancer cells and the levels of immune checkpoint ligands, but also by other components of the tumor microenvironment, among which the extracellular matrix (ECM) is emerging as key player. With the aim to comprehensively describe the relation between ECM and ICIs’ efficacy in cancer patients, the present review systematically evaluated the current literature regarding ECM remodeling in association with immunotherapeutic approaches. Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42022351180). PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were comprehensively searched from inception to January 2023. Titles, abstracts and full text screening was performed to exclude non eligible articles. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results: After employing relevant MeSH and key terms, we identified a total of 5070 studies. Among them, 2540 duplicates, 1521 reviews or commentaries were found and excluded. Following title and abstract screening, the full text was analyzed, and 47 studies meeting the eligibility criteria were retained. The studies included in this systematic review comprehensively recapitulate the latest observations associating changes of the ECM composition following remodeling with the traits of the tumor immune cell infiltration. The present study provides for the first time a broad view of the tight association between ECM molecules and ICIs efficacy in different tumor types, highlighting the importance of ECM-derived proteolytic products as promising liquid biopsy-based biomarkers to predict the efficacy of ICIs. Conclusion: ECM remodeling has an important impact on the immune traits of different tumor types. Increasing evidence pinpoint at ECM-derived molecules as putative biomarkers to identify the patients that would most likely benefit from ICIs treatments.

"Model-based system engineering (MBSE) for automotive requirements is gaining prominence over the last decade in the software industry. MBSE models can be designed and constructed for the corresponding unit level requirements to system level requirements using tools like MATLAB/Simulink, ASCET, etc. Once these models are made available, extracting and inferring information from these models will help in understanding on how the corresponding requirements are realized. Here, we tried to develop a technique to capture these model-related data from image files and converting them into equivalent knowledge. The knowledge is extracted, interpreted, and inferred for a given context and stored it in the form of a knowledge graph (KG). There are three major components: element detection, connection analysis, and text analysis. Here each of these components is further explained in detail. The information obtained out of these components is used to generate knowledge graphs. These KGs are further used for various applications in the V-model software development cycle. Test case generation is one among various use cases of a KG. Here brief explanation is provided on an use case where KG is used as a means to create test intents through querying. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"The article deals with the genre originality of Lyudmila Petrushevskaya’s story “The New Robinsons”. The story, first published in 1989, masquerades as a Robinsonade, a dystopia, and a sample of village prose (with its admiration for the peasants and peasant women of pre-revolutionary times), but the true goal of Petrushevskaya is much more ambitious: the story is an invariant of the biblical story about the rebirth of humankind after a global catastrophe. The very title of the story directly indicates the genre of robinsonade. One can easily single out elements of dystopia in the story with the help of text analysis, as well as intertextual references to the prose of village writers (mainly, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Valentin Rasputin). The key phrase of the story “The New Robinsons” refers to biblical sources: “There was a boy and a girl for the continuation of the human race.” In this light, it becomes clear why Petrushevskaya, seemingly casually, reports that the narrator’s father once injured “in the thigh” and remained forever lame. It is a reference to Jacob, who was once injured “in the thigh” when he fought with God. He, just like the narrator’s father, spent most of his life on the run, and was the one, from whom the twelve tribes of the Jewish people eventually originated. © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences."
"Dialectal Arabic is a term that covers Arabic dialects, resulting from linguistic interference between the Arabic language and local or neighboring languages. The automatic identification of dialects is a task that allows to recognize automatically the dialect used to write a text. This task is very important for several other NLP tasks, where a priory knowledge of the dialect of an input text can be useful for the rest of the process, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation and hate speech detection. The general objective of this paper is to propose a new approach for the identification of Arabic dialects in textual content. The first obstacle to the development of this task is the lack of resources and especially of balanced dataset. To address this issue and achieve our goal we started by building a balanced dataset by merging together and filtering 7 datasets. Then we proposed a new approach for Arabic dialect identification based on the combination of CNN with BiLSTM. To evaluate our model, we conducted a comparative study of several machine learning and deep learning models using a bunch of features. We considered these models as baseline and compared their results against the ones obtained by our model. The evaluation of our approach showed about 2% improvement in accuracy, compared to the best baseline models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"In recent years, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems have grown significantly in Brazil, particularly for individuals with cognitive disorders who rely on high-tech AAC tools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly improved high-tech AAC systems by enhancing accessibility, increasing output generation speed, and improving AAC interfaces' customization and adaptability. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic text data to augment a corpus for AAC in Brazilian Portuguese. A three-step method was used to augment an initial corpus of 667 AAC-like sentences produced by specialists to a corpus of 13k sentences, comprising sentence collection, corpus augmentation using GPT-3 in a few-shot setting, and corpus cleaning. The quality and reliability of the generated corpus were assessed through a coverage analysis, comparing the content of the generated sentences with the original human-composed sentences. The results provide insights into the methods' strengths and limitations and inform future efforts to improve the generation of synthetic text data for the AAC domain in Brazilian Portuguese.  © 2023 IEEE."
"With the increase in the use of the internet over the globe, the exchange and storage of information have seen an exponential surge as well. While writing and reading, people prefer shorter versions of content to save time and derive only significant insights. This has promoted the use of summarization in the past few decades. Since human-generated summaries are resource and time-intensive, automatic text summarization was developed. Inspired by these problems and by observing the issue of time management among our peers in the research community, we have tried to form a system that converts a research paper into a presentation. This system takes the research paper as the input document, summarizes the content section-wise and adds it to slides which are combined into a presentation. The techniques used to summarize are Text Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis, and Text Rank Algorithm. The model is tested on four different papers and evaluated on their ROUGE scores to compute their utility. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that helps us quickly classify short texts. It works by effectively capturing the semantic themes of texts and assigning the similar texts into the same cluster. Due to the excellent ability of contrastive learning to learn representations, using contrastive learning to extract semantic features for clustering tasks has become a new trend for short text clustering. However, the existing short text clustering methods pay more attention to the global information, and lead to wrong classification for samples with ambiguous clusters. Therefore, we propose graph-based short text clustering via contrastive learning with graph embedding (GCCL) - a novel framework that leverages the affinity between samples and neighbors to impose constraints on the low-dimensional representation space. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate GCCL on short text benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that GCCL outperforms the baseline method in terms of accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI). In addition, our approach achieves impressive results in terms of convergence speed, demonstrating the guidance of graph embeddings for short text clustering tasks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"While public consultation is a signature process of democratic policy formulation, many governments manoeuvre to refract citizen’s opinions or conduct it perfunctorily. Using the case of a medium of instruction policy in Hong Kong, this article unveils the strategies that the state and citizens employ to put their opinion through to the final policy text, during a public consultation process. Recent literature has identified the mechanisms through which individual actors or organisations contribute to broad policy agenda-setting or policy programme development. However, yet to be investigated is how they–sometimes with conflicting interests–collectively negotiate a policy with the state via public consultations. This paper investigates this very phenomenon, building on previous work conducted in the public policy field, analysing 51 government-generated documents through both thematic content analysis and critical discourse analysis. The paper uncovers four strategies adopted by administrations (non-commitment, case closure, disengagement for irrelevance, and placation) to evade citizens’ equity-oriented demands and stakeholders’ three counter strategies (mobilising other stakeholders into a coalition, reopening the case pointing out a new problem, and appealing by affirming relevance). The state’s discrete refusals and stakeholders’ conjoint reengagement tactics draw our attention to the complexity and subtlety involved in negotiation via public consultations. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Arabic sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, particularly to assess whether the writer’s attitude toward a given topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. In sentiment analysis, aspect category detection (ACD) attempts to identify the aspect categories mentioned in a sentence. Our study investigates the effects of transfer learning across several Arabic NLP tasks. We proposed a new shared DistilBERT model, which is a fine-tuned version of the basic DistilBERT. Our results demonstrate the outperforming of the proposed approach for the two tasks presented in the study, with a small variation. We also showed the limited effects of transfer learning on the performance of the proposed approach, particularly for highly dialectic comments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Peer reviews are one of the most important artifacts in scholarly communications. Peer reviews can serve as a rich source of knowledge discovery from texts that are human-generated and also opinionated on the paper under scrutiny. Reviewers comment on several implicit aspects of the paper (Originality, Soundness, Clarity, Appropriateness, etc.) where they sometimes appreciate, sometimes discuss, or sometimes question or criticize the work. Hence, correctly understanding the reviewer's aspectual perspective on the paper is crucial for chairs/editors to take a stand and also for the authors to respond or revise accordingly. In this paper, we introduce MASEPR, a novel multitask deep neural architecture to jointly discover the aspects and associated sentiments from the peer review texts. Our proposed approach leverages the knowledge sharing between aspect and sentiment lexicons to generate predictions. We outperform the standard baselines by a significant margin. We also make our codes available at https://github.com/cruxieu17/MASEPR.  © 2023 IEEE."
"When deep neural network has been proposed to assist the dentist in designing the location of dental implant, most of them are targeting simple cases where only one missing tooth is available. As a result, literature works do not work well when there are multiple missing teeth and easily generate false predictions when the teeth are sparsely distributed. In this paper, we are trying to integrate a weak supervision text, the target region, to the implant position regression network, to address above issues. We propose a text condition embedded implant position regression network (TCEIP), to embed the text condition into the encoder-decoder framework for improvement of the regression performance. A cross-modal interaction that consists of cross-modal attention (CMA) and knowledge alignment module (KAM) is proposed to facilitate the interaction between features of images and texts. The CMA module performs a cross-attention between the image feature and the text condition, and the KAM mitigates the knowledge gap between the image feature and the image encoder of the CLIP. Extensive experiments on a dental implant dataset through five-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed TCEIP achieves superior performance than existing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

Experiments on four ABSA benchmark datasets validates the effectiveness of our modules in extracting aspect-level sentiment features. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Arm support is a typical assistive technology device to assist shoulder and elbow movements in those with reduced upper extremity muscle strength due to neurological lesions. Recently, the assisting method, range, and manipulation method of arm support are also changing with the development of technology. Accordingly, an assessment system is required for appropriate matching and measuring the effectiveness in the clinical field. This study examines the direction of the assessment process by analyzing studies that measured the effectiveness of arm support through a systematic literature review. The databases were collected using Embase, CINAHL Plus with Full text, Web of Science, and Scopus. 19 studies were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flow chart. Most studies have been conducted on people with neuromuscular disorders. Assessment area included performance, function, usability, satisfaction, and psychosocial impact. And more than half of the studies measured performance and function. There were various assessment methods to measure the effectiveness including assessment tools, kinematics, physical examination, questionnaire, observation, and EMG, with assessment tools accounting for more than half of the studies. Most studies have set up assessment environments based on tasks related to ADLs and IADLs to measure the effectiveness. Currently, various methods such as assessment tools and kinematics were applied to measure the effectiveness of arm support. The assessment tool was used the most among them. However, assistive technology-based assessment tools are extremely limited. Therefore, it is required to develop an assessment tool centered on assistive technology based on performance related to ADL and IADL in the future. © 2023, The Author(s)."

"Background: Surgical volume is a surgical indicator that was described in the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) and the World Bank World Development Indicators as an important metric for tracking the delivery of surgical care. Objectives: We aimed to characterize the reports on surgical volume (SV) in the existing literature by using a systematic review to assess studies that examine surgical procedures as a ratio of a population (procedures/100,000 population). Methods: The PRISMA guideline was employed in the systematic review of articles that addressed the measurement of SV in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the primary outcome of surgical procedures/100,000 population. Findings: The search result consisted of 6,657 preliminary studies. Following the title and abstract screening, 6,464 articles were excluded, and the remaining 193 were included in the full text review. From the full text review of the 193, only 26 of these articles defined SV as the ratio of number of procedures per population of the catchment/geographical area. The reported SV was a mean of 765, with an SD of 1260 operations per 100,000. The median SV was 180 (min = 0.900, max = 4470). Conclusion: Our findings support the LCoGS assessment of the gap in surgical care. The target for SV is 5000 per 100,000 population, compared to the average of 765 per 100,000 population as found in this review. The challenges for assessing surgical volume gaps are vast, including the nature of written records, which limits SV reports to an absolute number of procedures per year without a reference to the catchment population. For the purpose of tracking SV, we recommend using proxies that account for the capacity of facilities to deliver care regardless of the catchment population. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"There are conditions that lead professors to use different text formats in quantum physics courses. Studying these conditions is an important aspect to understand the dynamics of physics pedagogy, and philosophy of science can be used as an orientation to do so. A case study was conducted at a Brazilian initial physics teacher training program. Using a framework based on Fleck’s work, we investigate the thought style of the participating professor regarding reading and textual forms in physics education, as well as the relationship of this thought style with his choice of materials used in class—which may manifest resistances and points of entry for text formats in these contexts. The teaching practices of this professor in two physics courses, which had differing levels of comprehension regarding quantum physics, were analyzed through observations and a qualitative interview. The analysis of the professor’s voice indicated an understanding of texts in disciplines of quantum physics influenced by cultural elements as described by Kuhn’s philosophy on physics pedagogy. However, according to the style of thought that guides his perception of the students’ training needs, entry to other texts (from other levels and digital materials) is promoted. These results can contribute to the development of theories on professors’ choices and attitudes linked to the perception of training needs in undergraduate physics courses, as well as indicating that changes demand collective actions at the institutional level. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the basic principle of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to recognize and treat diseases. Accurate syndrome differentiation can provide a reliable basis for treatment, therefore, establishing a scientific intelligent syndrome differentiation method is of great significance to the modernization of TCM. With the development of biomdical text mining technology, TCM has entered the era of intelligence that based on data, and model training increasingly relies on the large-scale labeled data. However, it is difficult to form a large standard data set in the field of TCM due to the low degree of standardization of TCM data collection and the privacy protection of patients’ medical records. To solve the above problem, a multi-label deep forest model based on an improved multi-label ReliefF feature selection algorithm, ML-PRDF, is proposed to enhance the representativeness of features within the model, express the original information with fewer features, and achieve optimal classification accuracy, while alleviating the problem of high data processing cost of deep forest models and achieving effective TCM discriminative analysis under small samples. The results show that the proposed model finally outperforms other multi-label classification models in terms of multi-label evaluation criteria, and has higher accuracy in the TCM syndrome differentiation problem compared with the traditional multi-label deep forest, and the comparative study shows that the use of PCC-MLRF algorithm for feature selection can better select representative features.

"Introduction. Writing skill is one of the most important skills that English-majored students need to master to apply to their jobs after graduation. However, developing writing skill is not easy, especially for students who are not native speakers. To solve that problem, instructional scaffolding plays a very important role to help English-majored students improve their writing skills. Instructional scaffolding is an approach to teaching that involves providing students with temporary support and guidance as they learn new concepts and skills. The goal of scaffolding is to gradually remove this support as students become more proficient, so they can eventually work independently. This approach can be used in a variety of educational settings, from early childhood education to higher education. Scaffolding can take many forms, such as visual aids, graphic organizers, guided questions, or peer collaboration. The type of scaffolding used depends on the learning objectives and the needs of the individual student. In short, instructional scaffolding is a powerful tool for promoting student learning and success. By providing targeted support and guidance, educators can help students build their knowledge and skills in a structured and effective way. In this article, the author will focus on researching the role of scaffolding in writing skills for English majored students at The University of Khanh Hoa. Study participants and methods. The article uses the method of questionnaire survey and in-depth interview to study the status of the role of instructional scaffolding in writing skills of English-majored students at The University of Khanh Hoa. Besides the author also uses methods such as: analysis; synthetic; logic; history to write articles. To have an objective view of the role of academic support activities in writing skill of English-majored students at the University of Khanh Hoa, the author conducted a survey of 133 students studying ""writing 1"", in the academic year 2022-2023 and selected 13 students to conduct in-depth interviews. The design is done on a five-step scale. The survey results were processed by SPSS software, with the question why instructional scaffolding are necessary in the English writing classes? The results obtained provide vocabulary and grammar that students agree with at a high level, reaching a level above 4.5, showing that learners appreciate scaffolding. Activities such as doing exercises are 3.47; students' cross feedback is 3.87; the lecturer provides sample text with the corresponding mean value of 3.8; Students reading specialized documents and articles is 3.76. From the data obtained, it is shown that the provision of vocabulary and grammar is the activity most appreciated by students in scaffolding. Meanwhile, doing the set of exercises only scored lower than the other activities. However, students giving each other feedback, lecturers providing sample texts, and students reading specialized papers and articles all achieved relatively high cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) and are also valuable in instructional scaffolding. Results. Students believe that teachers need to help them develop skills such as: skills to develop ideas for articles; skills to build article structure; language skills; paragraph writing skills; Sentence linking skills. The lack of these skills explains why, while the self-assessments of children's progress were quite positive for each sub-skill, they were the lowest in the overall assessment of progress in writing and speaking. Practical significance. The role of scaffolding in the writing skills of English majors has been studied by many universities around the world so far. In Vietnam in general and the University of Khanh Hoa, this activity plays an important role in improving students' writing capacity to meet social needs. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

"Background: In times of genotype guided therapy options, a total of 3.2 % of people with CF (pwCF) in the German CF Registry[1] only have one or no CFTR-variant detected after genetic analysis. Additionally, genetic data in the Registry can be documented as free text and can therefore be prone to error. In order to allow the greatest possible amount of pwCF access to modern therapies, we conducted a re-evaluation of free text entries and established a custom-whole-CFTR-locus NGS-approach for all pwCF who remained without genetic confirmation afterwards. Methods: To this end, we assembled 731 free text variants of 655 pwCF in the German CF Registry. All variants were evaluated using ClinVar, HGMD and CFTR1/2, corrected in the Registries’ database and uploaded to ClinVar. PwCF whose diagnosis remained uncertain as well as additional pwCF or pwCFTR-RD that were assembled through a nationwide call for testing of unclear cases were offered genetic analysis. Samples were analysed using a target-capture based NGS-custom-design-panel covering the entire CFTR-locus. Results: Evaluation of free text variants led to the discovery of 43 variants not formerly reported in the context of CF. The Registries’ dropdown list was extended by 497 variants and over 500 pwCF were provided with their most up-to-date genotype. Samples of 47 pwCF/pwCFTR-RD were sequenced via NGS with an overall success rate of 61.7 %, resulting in implementation of entire CFTR-genotyping into routine diagnostics. Conclusion: Entire CFTR-genotyping can greatly increase the genetic diagnostic rate of pwCF/pwCFTR-RD and should be considered after inconspicuous CFTR screening panels in CFTR-diagnostics. © 2023 European Cystic Fibrosis Society"
"Similar case analysis (SCA) is an essential topic in legal artificial intelligence, serving as a reference for legal professionals. Most existing works treat SCA as a traditional text classification task and ignore some important legal elements that affect the verdict and case similarity, like legal events, and thus are easily misled by semantic structure. To address this issue, we propose a Legal Event-Context Model named LECM to improve the accuracy and interpretability of SCA based on Chinese legal corpus. The event-context integration mechanism, which is an essential component of the LECM, is proposed to integrate the legal event and context information based on the attention mechanism, enabling legal events to be associated with their corresponding relevant contexts. We introduce an event detection module to obtain the legal event information, which is pre-trained on a legal event detection dataset to avoid labeling events manually. We conduct extensive experiments on two SCA tasks, i.e., similar case matching (SCM) and similar case retrieval (SCR). Compared with baseline models, LECM is validated by about 13% and 11% average improvement in terms of mean average precision and accuracy respectively, for SCR and SCM tasks. These results indicate that LECM effectively utilizes event-context knowledge to enhance SCA performance and its potential application in various legal document analysis tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Purpose: To systematically review the existing literature that examines the relationship between cognition, hearing, and language in children using cochlear implants and hearing aids. Method: The review has been registered in Prospero (Registration: CRD 42020203974). The review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and examined the scientific literature in VHL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, WOS, and Embase. It included original observational studies in children using hearing aids and/or cochlear implants who underwent cognitive and auditory and/or language tests. Data were extracted from the studies and their level of evidence was graded with the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to data heterogeneity. Outcomes are described in narrative and tables synthesis. Results: The systematic search and subsequent full-text evaluation identified 21 studies, conducted in 10 different countries. Altogether, their samples comprised 1,098 individuals, aged 0.16–12.6 years. The studies assessed the following cognitive domains: memory, nonverbal cognition, reasoning, attention, executive functions, language, perceptual-motor function, visuoconstructive ability, processing speed, and phonological processing/phonological memory. Children with hearing loss using cochlear implants and hearing aids scored significantly lower in many cognitive functions than normal hearing (NH) children. Neurocognitive functions were correlated with hearing and language outcomes. Conclusion: Many cognitive tools were used to assess cognitive function in children with hearing devices. Results suggest that children with cochlear implants and hearing aids have cognitive deficits; these outcomes are mainly correlated with vocabulary. This study highlights the need to understand children’s cognitive function and increase the knowledge of the relationship between cognition, language, and hearing in children using cochlear implants and hearing aids.

"Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a challenging yet critical task for recognizing emotions in text, with various applications in social media, commodity reviews, and movie comments. Many researchers are working on developing more powerful sentiment analysis models. Most existing models use the pre-trained language models based fine-tuning paradigm, which only utilizes the encoder parameters of pre-trained language models. However, this approach fails to effectively leverage the prior knowledge revealed in pre-trained language models. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Target Word Transferred Language Model for aspect-based sentiment analysis (WordTransABSA), which investigates the potential of the pre-training scheme of pre-trained language models. WordTransABSA is an encoder-decoder architecture built on top of the Masked Language Model of Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers. During the training procedure, we reformulate the previous generic fine-tuning models as a “Masked Language Model” task, which follows the original BERT pre-training paradigm. WordTransABSA takes full advantage of the versatile linguistic knowledge of Pre-trained Language Model, resulting in competitive accuracy compared with recent baselines, especially in data-insufficient scenarios. We have made our code publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/albert-jin/WordTransABSA ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Foundation models have exhibited remarkable success in various applications, such as disease diagnosis and text report generation. To date, a foundation model for endoscopic video analysis is still lacking. In this paper, we propose Endo-FM, a foundation model specifically developed using massive endoscopic video data. First, we build a video transformer, which captures both local and global long-range dependencies across spatial and temporal dimensions. Second, we pre-train our transformer model using global and local views via a self-supervised manner, aiming to make it robust to spatial-temporal variations and discriminative across different scenes. To develop the foundation model, we construct a large-scale endoscopy video dataset by combining 9 publicly available datasets and a privately collected dataset from Baoshan Branch of Renji Hospital in Shanghai, China. Our dataset overall consists of over 33K video clips with up to 5 million frames, encompassing various protocols, target organs, and disease types. Our pre-trained Endo-FM can be easily adopted for a given downtream task via fine-tuning by serving as the backbone. With experiments on 3 different types of downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection, our Endo-FM surpasses the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised pre-training and adapter-based transfer learning methods by a significant margin, such as VCL (3.1% F1, 4.8% Dice, and 5.5% F1 for classification, segmentation, and detection) and ST-Adapter (5.9% F1, 9.6% Dice, and 9.9% F1 for classification, segmentation, and detection).

"The rapidly growing volume of scientific publications offers an interesting challenge for research on methods for analyzing the authorship of documents with one or more authors. However, most existing datasets lack scientific documents or the necessary metadata for constructing new experiments and test cases. We introduce SMAuC, a comprehensive, metadata-rich corpus tailored to scientific authorship analysis. Comprising over 3 million publications across various disciplines from over 5 million authors, SMAuC is the largest openly accessible corpus for this purpose. It encompasses scientific texts from humanities and natural sciences, accompanied by extensive, curated metadata, including unambiguous author IDs. SMAuC aims to significantly advance the domain of authorship analysis in scientific texts.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The military metaphors frequently used to talk about public health and sanitation issues generate controversies among professionals and academics. The debates around the COVID-19 pandemic constitute a new episode of this phenomenon. This paper aims to analyze the conceptual metaphors, whose source domain is war or the military, used by the Chinese press to represent the pandemic caused by COVID-19. Based on a corpus of 679 news texts and opinion articles corresponding to a period of 18 months, some key factors of conceptualization have been identified: war, soldier, enemy, pioneer, accomplice and weapon. The samples extracted show that the use of metaphorical expressions related to the source domain of war is associated with the specific political, cultural and socioeconomic environments of China. Since those expressions have been widely accepted in Chinese newspapers about the current pandemic, a better understanding of this topic will shed light on how China influences public opinion and shapes the public agenda both domestically and globally. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

"Background: Older adults are at an increased risk of drug-related problems, especially following discharge from hospital. Drug-related readmissions place a large burden on the patient and the healthcare system. However, previous studies report inconsistent results on the prevalence and associated risk factors for drug-related hospital readmissions in older adults. Objectives: We aimed to assess the prevalence of drug-related readmissions in older adults aged 65 years and older and investigate the drug classes, preventability and risk factors most associated with these readmissions. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to answer our objectives. A search of four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus) was conducted. Three authors independently performed title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction of all included studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the pooled prevalence of drug-related readmissions across all studies, and a subgroup analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity among studies reporting on adverse drug reaction-related readmissions. Results: A total of 1978 studies were identified in the initial search, of which four studies were included in the final synthesis. Three studies focused on readmissions due to adverse drug reactions and one study focused on readmissions due to drug-related problems. A pooled prevalence of 9% (95% confidence interval 2–18) was found for drug-related readmissions across all studies, and a pooled prevalence of 6% (95% confidence interval 4–10) was found for adverse drug reaction-related readmissions. Three studies explored the preventability of readmissions and 15.4–22.2% of cases were deemed preventable. The drug classes most associated with adverse drug reaction readmissions included anticoagulants, antibiotics, psychotropics and chemotherapy agents. Polypharmacy (the use of five or more medications) and several comorbidities such as cancer, liver disease, ischaemic heart disease and peptic ulcer disease were identified as risk factors for drug-related readmissions. Conclusions: Almost one in ten older adults discharged from hospital experienced a drug-related hospital readmission, with one fifth of these deemed preventable. Several comorbidities and the use of polypharmacy and high-risk drugs were identified as prominent risk factors for readmission. Further research is needed to explore possible causes of drug-related readmissions in older adults for a more guided approach to the development of effective medication management interventions. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The rapid spread of media content synthesis technology and the potentially damaging impact of audio and video deepfakes on people’s lives have raised the need to implement systems able to detect these forgeries automatically. In this work we present a novel approach for synthetic speech detection, exploiting the combination of two high-level semantic properties of the human voice. On one side, we focus on speaker identity cues and represent them as speaker embeddings extracted using a state-of-the-art method for the automatic speaker verification task. On the other side, voice prosody, intended as variations in rhythm, pitch or accent in speech, is extracted through a specialized encoder. We show that the combination of these two embeddings fed to a supervised binary classifier allows the detection of deepfake speech generated with both Text-to-Speech and Voice Conversion techniques. Our results show improvements over the considered baselines, good generalization properties over multiple datasets and robustness to audio compression. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The representation of events in text plays a significant role in various NLP tasks. Recent research demonstrates that contrastive learning has the ability to improve event comprehension capabilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and enhance the performance of event representation learning. However, the efficacy of event representation learning based on contrastive learning and PLMs is limited by the short length of event texts. The length of event texts differs significantly from the text length used in the pre-training of PLMs. As a result, there is inconsistency in the distribution of text length between pre-training and event representation learning, which may undermine the learning process of event representation based on PLMs. In this study, we present PromptCL, a novel framework for event representation learning that effectively elicits the capabilities of PLMs to comprehensively capture the semantics of short event texts. PromptCL utilizes a Prompt template borrowed from prompt learning to expand the input text during Contrastive Learning. This helps in enhancing the event representation learning by providing a structured outline of the event components. Moreover, we propose Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) word order and Event-oriented Masked Language Modeling (EventMLM) to train PLMs to understand the relationships between event components. Our experimental results demonstrate that PromptCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on event related tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis and demonstrate that using a prompt results in improved generalization capabilities for event representations (Our code will be available at https://github.com/YuboFeng2023/PromptCL ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The object of this paper is to present an interpretation of the well-known distinction between the active intellect and the passive intellect in De anima III, 5 using as a basis a previous article entitled ""a modest proposal."" To achieve this aim, I will expound on the fundamental nucleus of that recent proposal, which identifies the active intellect with the habit of principles and with the content of the first principles. I will then point out certain objections to the aforementioned interpretation. Finally, I will provide an analysis of the marks or characteristics of the active intellect in the text of Aristotle.

"The article discusses the relation between the Spanish Jesuit José de Acosta (1540-1600) and the Dutch Reformed theologian Johannes Hoornbeeck (1617-1666). Distant for the time they lived, for the spaces where they developed their action and for the very creed they professed, these two religious achieved an important reflection on the role of the Christian mission in territories of barbarians and pagans. In a period of strong political and religious disputes between Catholics and Protestants, the analysis of Hoornbeeck’s main text allows us to better understand a delicate process of appropriation and re-elaboration of the idea of mission within the parameters of the Dutch reformed dogma carried out from the Peruvian problematic by the Jesuit Acosta. © 2023 Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciencias Humanas.

"This article aims to analyze the emergence of the “New Kalam Movement” as a part of the discussions on religious sciences and modernization during the late Ottoman period. Among the main factors behind this movement were the interest of the Ottoman intellectuals in modernization, as well as their closer and more direct contact with Western thought. As a result of numerous translations and discussions, late Ottoman scholars attempted to revive kalam texts, which they considered to be outdated. In the article, it is argued that the scholars of Islamic theology, who were affected by modern scientific dynamism, which started in the last years of the Ottomans and continued at the beginning of the Republic period, made significant contributions to the understanding of religious and intellectual thought. Based on their determination, major figures representing the movement, such as İzmirli İsmail Hakkı, attempted to revitalize kalam and change the method, not only to update this discipline, but also to respond to the critical arguments directed at the issues of belief. In addition to their aims and methods, the article discusses what they achieved and could not achieve, in line with their goals and prospects. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"P.F. Strawson is one of the most famous Kantian philosophers and interpretators of Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason”. This study is dedicated to reconstruction of this interpretation. It is also dedicated to the analysis of the story and place of Strawson’s interpretation in the history of his own philosophical career. I show how Strawson reads Kant’s text, what strategies of interpretation he adopts and what problems he faces. In “Individuals” and “The Bounds of Sense” Strawson explicitly associates himself with Kant and considers himself as Kantian philosopher. Kantian philosophy for Strawson is the descriptive, anti-sceptical metaphysics that seeks to explicate our basic conceptual sсheme. However, due to various criticism, Strawson had to abandon descriptive metaphysics and to change his intellectual figures. On of the main heroes of “Skepticism and Naturalism” — his late book — becomes Hume. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the explanation of the transition from Kant to Hume. In this work, Strawson argues for some kind of soft Hume-like naturalism instead of previously held descriptive metaphysics. This kind of naturalism is more modest than metaphysics. It does not pretend to be the main and the most fundamental of all the philosophical studies. It is simply an analysis of one of the possible philosophical perspective.

"This paper introduces a newly developed service called MINE. The service assists Digital Humanities scientists in solving two problems: data acquisition and text analysis on a large scale. MINE consists of two main components: a search engine and a workspace. The search engine does not only provide a way to search across various data sources, but also facilitates access to difficult-to-access sources. Meanwhile, the workspace allows users to analyze data using provided models or writing their own analysis workflows. Thanks to this, a new approach to text analysis in Digital Humanities can be taken, which enables large-scale analyses.  © 2023 IEEE."

"The video game industry is currently one of the largest in the global market. Video games have played an important role and made a significant impact on many people’s lives, especially the youth. In this paper, we perform an analysis of video games based on players’ reviews on Steam, a very popular video gaming platform. We classify the video games in the dataset into five categories based on Steam’s classification methods: shooter/First-Person Shooter (FPS), strategy, Role-Playing Games (RPG), sandbox/open world, and sports. We conducted exploratory analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling of the game review data at the individual-game level as well as game category level. Our analysis shows that shooter/FPS and strategy games are the two most popular game categories. Through sentimental analysis, we found that the strategy and shooter/FPS categories show slightly more positive sentiments, and the sports category shows slightly more negative sentiments. Our exploratory analysis shows that players tend to spend significantly more hours in shooter/FPS and strategy games, and these two categories of games contain a substantially higher percentage of outliers, who spend extraordinarily long hours gaming. We also found that the outliers had fewer friends despite their extremely long playing hours. Topic modeling for these two categories reveals some interesting discoveries, such as players’ enthusiasm about and the time they spent on the games, as well as their views about the game community and the impact of the games on their lives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Instance-level correlation and cluster-level discrepancy of data are two crucial aspects of short text clustering. Current deep clustering methods, however, suffer from inaccurate estimation of either instance-level correlation or cluster-level discrepancy of data and strongly relay on the quality of the initial text representation. In this paper, we propose a Non-outlier Pseudo-labeling-based Short Text Clustering (NPLC) method, which consists of two parts. In the first part, we use Mask Language Model (MLM) to pre-train the feature model on a given dataset to enhance the initial text representation. The second part based on non-outlier pseudo-labeling is a joint training in which we first cluster the dataset and select cluster labels of outlier-free data in each cluster as pseudo labels for the next joint training based on a novel framework. The novel framework makes use of a contrastive loss to gain excellent inter-cluster separation by minimizing similarity between outlier-free and outlier data and a clustering loss to narrow intra-cluster distances by maximizing similarity among outlier-free data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NPLC achieves significant improvements over existing methods and advances the state-of-the-art results on most benchmark datasets with 1%–12% improvement on Accuracy and 1%–6% improvement on Normalized Mutual Information. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Maintenance and recordkeeping require agricultural field data. These agricultural fields may have text, schematic drawings, logos, barcodes, and serial numbers. Rectangular metal or synthetic farming fields. This study classifies satellite images of the region using CNN and deep learning. Manufacturers change field dimensions. Satellite image localization aids pest control, scene analysis, and field tracking. Context—the flow of information between a satellite picture and a Convolutional Neural Network—is as important as satellite image data for interpretation. CNN classifiers identify satellite fields. Quadrilaterals localize satellite images better than rectangles. A convolutional neural network processes the noise-reduced regions (CNN). CNN's preprocessing sorts of comparable qualities by size and arranges them into text lines. CNN's tech is industry wide. If the CNN scored at least one text region low, the user is invited to take a new image of that portion of the field, which is compared to the original image and text processing is repeated. Operation ends after a certain number of attempts or when all regions score sufficiently. Following 300 rounds of training and testing, the CNN has 98.17% accuracy and outputs the type of field detected, a list of regions containing extracted text, and its reliability. 70%, 20%, and 10% of the data trained, tested, and verified the suggested system. A dataset with several classes showed the feature vector's utility. Python deep learning was used for the study. Our architecture has three distinct but equally critical functional head networks, therefore training simultaneously may cause instability. If the model fails to converge, the head design may be hidden. We gradually incorporated each functional head throughout design to ensure the single-head design concept was strong. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Freedom has a fundamental systematic value in Kant s philosophy. In practical philosophy, it is a condition of action in an eminent sense. In the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant tries to prove freedom. The argumentation in both books is different. The present work focuses mainly on the justification of the second Critique. In it, Kant states that we know about freedom thanks to the fact of moral conscience or a law that binds the subject unconditionally. An attempt will be made to show, from a consideration of Kant s texts, the works of some interpreters, as well as a systematic reflection, that freedom, and the fact of moral conscience, require access to practical spontaneity on the part of of the subject, an issue that Kant leaves suggested in some passages. © 2023 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

"Analyzing the pattern of semantic variation in long real-world texts such as books or transcripts is interesting from the stylistic, cognitive, and linguistic perspectives. It is also useful for applications such as text segmentation, document summarization, and detection of semantic novelty. The recent emergence of several vector-space methods for sentence embedding has made such analysis feasible. However, this raises the issue of how consistent and meaningful the semantic representations produced by various methods are in themselves. In this paper, we compare several recent sentence embedding methods via time-series of semantic similarity between successive sentences and matrices of pairwise sentence similarity for multiple books of literature. In contrast to previous work using target tasks and curated datasets to compare sentence embedding methods, our approach provides an evaluation of the methods “in the wild”. We find that most of the sentence embedding methods considered do infer highly correlated patterns of semantic similarity in a given document, but show interesting differences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented growth and productivity in every socioeconomic sector. AI adoption in education is transformational through reduced teacher workload, individualized learning, intelligent tutors, profiling and prediction, high-precision education, collaboration, and learner tracking. This paper highlights the trajectory of AI research in higher education (HE) through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling approaches. We used the PRISMA guidelines to select 304 articles published in the Scopus database between 2012 and 2021. VOSviewer was used for visualization and text-mining to identify hotspots in the field. Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals distinct topics in the dynamic relationship between AI and HE. Only 9.6% of AI research in HE was achieved in the first seven years, with the last three years contributing 90.4%. China, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom dominated publications. Four themes emerged–data as the catalyst, the development of AI, the adoption of AI in HE and emerging trends and the future of AI in HE. Topic modeling on the abstracts revealed the 10 most frequent topics and the top 30 most salient terms. This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing AI adoption opportunities in HE, topic modeling and future research areas. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unintended and harmful events associated with medication use. Despite their significance in postmarketing surveillance, quality improvement, and drug safety research, ADRs are vastly underreported. Enhanced digital-based communication of ADR information to regulators and among care providers could significantly improve patient safety. Objective: This paper presents a usability evaluation of the commercially available GuildCare Adverse Event Recording system, a web-based ADR reporting system widely used by community pharmacists (CPs) in Australia. Methods: We developed a structured interview protocol encompassing remote observation, think-aloud moderating techniques, and retrospective questioning to gauge the overall user experience, complemented by the System Usability Scale (SUS) assessment. Thematic analysis was used to analyze field notes from the interviews. Results: A total of 7 CPs participated in the study, who perceived the system to have above-average usability (SUS score of 68.57). Nonetheless, the structured approach to usability testing unveiled specific functional and user interpretation issues, such as unnecessary information, lack of system clarity, and redundant data fields—critical insights not captured by the SUS results. Design elements like drop-down menus, free-text entry, checkboxes, and prefilled or auto-populated data fields were perceived as useful for enhancing system navigation and facilitating ADR reporting. Conclusions: The user-centric design of technology solutions, like the one discussed herein, is crucial to meeting CPs’ information needs and ensuring effective ADR reporting. Developers should adopt a structured approach to usability testing during the developmental phase to address identified issues comprehensively. Such a methodological approach may promote the adoption of ADR reporting systems by CPs and ultimately enhance patient safety. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Purpose: Extension of adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond five years confers only modest survival benefit in breast cancer patients and carries risk of toxicities. This systematic review investigates the role of biomarker tests in predicting the clinical response to an extension of endocrine therapy. Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Global Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using an iterative approach to identify full-text articles related to breast cancer, endocrine therapy, and biomarkers. Results: Of the 1,217 unique reports identified, five studies were deemed eligible. Four investigated the Breast Cancer Index (BCI) assay in three distinct study populations. These studies consistently showed that BCI score was predictive of response to extended endocrine therapy among 1,946 combined patients, who were predominately non-Hispanic white and postmenopausal. Conclusions: Evidence in the setting of predictive tests for extended endocrine therapy is sparse. Most relevant studies investigated the use of BCI, but these study populations were largely restricted to a single age, race, and ethnicity group. Future studies should evaluate a variety of biomarkers in diverse populations. Without sufficient evidence, physicians and patients face a difficult decision in balancing the benefits and risks of endocrine therapy extension. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The study of human desire is significant in gaining a better understanding of human behavior and emotions, as desire is one of the most fundamental instincts of human beings. With the development of multimodal algorithms, there have been many recent research tasks using both text and visual information for sentiment classification. However, human desires underlying emotions are still relatively underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal approach that combines both visual and textual information to provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of human desires. Specifically, we first use text and visual encoders that can contain more information to extract features. To better connect the contextual relationships of the same modality and the associations of objects between different modalities, we construct a cross-modal graph and use the cross-attention method for graph representation learning. We evaluate our model on a public multimodal dataset of human desires. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in desire detection tasks (Our code can be found at https://github.com/guruitong/-MCAGN.git ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"With the exponential growth in the daily publication of scientific articles, automatic classification and categorization can assist in assigning articles to a predefined category. Article titles are concise descriptions of the articles’ content with valuable information that can be useful in document classification and categorization. However, shortness, data sparseness, limited word occurrences, and the inadequate contextual information of scientific document titles hinder the direct application of conventional text mining and machine learning algorithms on these short texts, making their classification a challenging task. This study firstly explores the performance of our earlier study, TextNetTopics on the short text. Secondly, here we propose an advanced version called TextNetTopics Pro, which is a novel short-text classification framework that utilizes a promising combination of lexical features organized in topics of words and topic distribution extracted by a topic model to alleviate the data-sparseness problem when classifying short texts. We evaluate our proposed approach using nine state-of-the-art short-text topic models on two publicly available datasets of scientific article titles as short-text documents. The first dataset is related to the Biomedical field, and the other one is related to Computer Science publications. Additionally, we comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of the models generated with and without using the abstracts. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling the imbalanced data, particularly in the classification of Drug-Induced Liver Injury articles as part of the CAMDA challenge. Taking advantage of the semantic information detected by topic models proved to be a reliable way to improve the overall performance of ML classifiers.

"In this study, state-of-the-art AI models are employed to classify aerospace maintenance records into categories based on the fault descriptions of avionic components. The classification is performed using short natural language text descriptions provided by specialised repair engineers. The primary goal is to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of a complex and lengthy maintenance dataset, with the objective of determining the likelihood of failures in non-critical components of airplanes. Various methodologies are used, including two vectorisation models to natural language representation, as well as several machine learning algorithms such as BiGRU and BiLSTM, to identify repair and replacement event likelihood from the provided corpora. The resulting performance of the deployed models provide a very high F1 score overall, indicating models’ ability to learn repair patterns from the, typically complex, engineering description of components with high confidence. Two case studies are conducted. The first for a binary classification, with several models achieving an average F1 score of around 95 %. In the second case, a multi-class classification is performed for four different classes, with the BiLSTM model achieving the highest performance, accurately predicting the validation set with a 95.2 % F1 score. The misclassified samples were manually inspected, and it was found that in many cases, the relevant information was simply missing from the text due to errors or omissions by description authors. Only 12 % of the misclassified samples were found to be due to errors made by the model, resulting in an effective accuracy rate of ∼ 99.4 %. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"At present, there are more and more researches on knowledge graph in various fields. This paper focuses on the knowledge graph in the field of education. According to the general process of knowledge graph construction, this paper constructed electric circuits course knowledge graph. Firstly, collect original text data from two sources: print books and publicly available online resources. Then, the construction of the domain ontology of the electric circuits course is presented, which defines entities, attributes, and relations in triples. Next, the knowledge extraction part is introduced, and a comparison experiment of named entity recognition on unstructured data is conducted, comparing the recognition performance of different entity types and different models. The results show that the BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF model has the best effect, with a precision of 91.85%. In addition, relation extraction is performed to transform unstructured data into structured triples, which are stored in MongoDB and Neo4j databases. Finally, the construction of the electric circuits course knowledge graph is completed.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Classical Chinese poetry is a literary genre that is rich in emotion and lyricism. However, sentiment classification on such poetry poses a challenge as they are typically short texts in classical Chinese, which are characterized by sparse features and non-standard information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called MISC (the Multimodal Imagery based Sentiment Classification), which takes the multimodal information of imagery into account. Imagery is widely used in classical Chinese poetry and has a strong positive correlation with the poet’s emotional expression. Considering that imagery words are closely related to visual modality, we have introduced visual modality information from imagery words in addition to the text modality. Our approach utilizes imagery words in poems and applies multi-head attention to the poem text, imagery words, and imagery pictures, respectively. Finally, we integrate multimodal features of the poem, and use it on sentiment classification task which output ternary classification results of negative, neutral and positive. Our results demonstrate an improvement in sentiment analysis of classical Chinese poetry through the incorporation of visual modalities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"This poster addresses accessibility issues of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) in digital libraries (DLs). ETDs are available primarily as PDF files, which present barriers to equitable access, especially for users with visual impairments, cognitive or learning disabilities, or for anyone needing more efficient and effective ways of finding relevant information within these long documents. We propose using AI techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and text analysis, to convert PDFs into machine-readable HTML documents with semantic tags and structure, extracting figures and tables, and generating summaries and keywords. Our goal is to increase the accessibility of ETDs and to make this important scholarship available to a wider audience.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The aim of this paper is to comment on Panagiotis Kondylis' remarks on the thought of Karl Marx. In its introductory part, the authors present an overview of the recent studies and point out some prospects for further research on the topic in question. The second part of the paper focuses on an analysis of Kondylis' texts that have not been discussed in previous studies, including both his first papers written as a university student and interviews given at the end of his life. The authors pay particular attention to the book Marks a grecka tradycja antyczna (Marx and the classical Greek antiquity), which is fully devoted to Marx's works and the translation of which has inspired the authors to write this article. The adopted perspective has enabled them to obtain a broader and more comprehensive picture of Kondylis' attitude toward the legacy of Karl Marx. © 2023, Nicolaus Copernicus University.

"The article is focused on Alexander Kushner’s poem “They don’t Choose the Times...”. We analyze the whole text and its first lines “They don’t choose the times, / They live and die in them”, which have been fixed in the Russian proverbial and quotation fund. Based on the linguistic analysis of the text, in particular, on the idiomatic approach, I attempt to deconstruct the poem. As it is shown, the key maxim oscillates between universal and situational meaning. The text of the poem realizes a rhetorical system of arguments to accept modernity and turns the paradoxical maxim into a rhetorical argument. The final stanza deserves special attention. The phrase from the criminal procedural discourse “to take fingerprints” plays the main role in it. The use of this figure of speech betrays the subject’s specific understanding of history and modernity. The system of text arguments appears to be disordered and contradictory. In my opinion, it can be explained by the traumatic nature of the Stalin’s era. The subject convinces to accept modernity not an imaginary interlocutor (a reader) as of himself, because he feels the danger of political persecution for having different views. The linguistic analysis of the poem “They don’t Choose the Times...” allows us to attribute this text to the official Soviet poetry only judging by immanent features. © 2023 Authors.

"Archaeological studies of ancient cities play an important role in recognizing their formation, development, collapse and extinction in different historical periods. The historical city of Barzand was one of the cities of the Islamic period in northwestern Iran, which had an important place in the Islamic period. The name of this city and its location on the slopes of Mount Sabalan has been mentioned in the written texts of the 9th to 13th centuries AD. Therefore, it is necessary to study and do research on it. The present study was performed by descriptive-analytical method. An attempt was made to compare the results of field studies and written historical sources with a comparative analysis to answer the following question: Which Archaeological site contains the remainders of the city of Barzand? The results of Archaeological studies and analysis of historical texts match the geographical location of Barzand city in Germi city, in the slopes of Mount Sabalan. © 2023 Univerzita Konstantina Filozofa v Nitre.

"Textual knowledge extraction and visual analysis technology bring new technical methodology to traditional qualitative research in the historical domain. However, there is still some difficulty impeding the semantic understanding and presentation for knowledge in historical texts. To address it, we propose a novel solution that integrates the semantic aggregation of different types of textual knowledge units in multiple technical pathways and hybrid strategies-based visual display for supporting smooth interactive functionalities with different groups of users. A visualization system is also developed, which can provide various digital tools to reveal the knowledge clues and patterns in both macro and micro level and support deep exploration of implicit knowledge around historical research. The user evaluation shows the effectiveness of our system and design solution. It is believed our preliminary research can promote knowledge organization and visualization of Chinese historical texts and a future extension to other domains.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Insufficient physical activity (PA) and excess weight increase illness risk for women. Face-to-face interventions can increase PA levels, however, they are often inaccessible. With growing interest in digital interventions, a Self-Determination Theory (SDT)–driven intervention was developed and delivered via email to promote PA in women who were insufficiently active and overweight or obese. Objective: This substudy explores users’ perspectives about the acceptability and usability of the intervention, which was coupled with a wearable activity monitor and PA recommendations. Methods: A 3-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (unblinded) was conducted in Ontario, Canada. Recruitment occurred from September 2018 to March 2019 via advertising through social media, web-based boards, and posters in publicly accessible areas. In total, 47 women with a BMI of ≥25 kg/m2 who were not meeting the Canadian PA guidelines were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms (arm 1: n=15, 32%, arm 2: n=16, 34%, arm 3: n=16, 34%). This substudy focused on the 15 participants allocated to the main intervention arm. Participants received an automated intervention consisting of (1) 6 weekly emails, (2) a Polar Electro Inc A300 activity monitor (with access to the Polar Flow website and companion smartphone app), and (3) a copy of the Canadian PA guidelines for adults. Emails were developed using SDT and designed to enhance autonomous motivation by fostering the psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Well-established motivational and behavior change techniques were embedded in the emails to promote needs satisfaction. After the intervention (ie, 7 weeks after randomization), participants were invited to complete a web-based acceptability and usability survey containing open-ended and closed-ended questions, responses were analyzed using descriptive and content analyses, respectively. Results: The analyses included data from 93% (14/15) of the women (age: mean 33.4, SD 7.5, range 24-44 years, BMI: mean 31.3, SD 5.8 kg/m2, range 25-40.5 kg/m2) who received the main intervention and completed the postintervention survey. Open-ended responses indicated that participants were generally satisfied with the intervention and appreciated that emails prompted self-reflection, kept them on track and accountable, provided informational support, and were nonpressuring. Furthermore, they suggested that the monitor was “enjoyable” and “helpful”, quantitative data corroborated this, as 71% (10/14) said that the monitor was “very valuable/absolutely valuable,” 71% (10/14) would “very probably/definitely” still use one, and 86% (12/14) wore it for ≥5 days per week for ≥8 hours per day and checked it “occasionally/frequently/very frequently.” Potential threats to acceptability included “long” and “text-heavy” emails, lack of personal contact, and cumbersome, unaesthetic monitors. Conclusions: Results suggest that this SDT-driven, email-delivered intervention may be an acceptable low-contact approach to promote PA in women who are overweight or obese and insufficiently active, however, improvements are warranted and studies ascertaining its effectiveness are needed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The purpose of this study is to help industry practitioners learn how to get the most benefit from attending technical conferences (organizing attendees to participate in the highest impact talks, maximizing vendor interactions, and using data analytics to identify prevailing technology trends and research partnerships). Using the SPE/AAPG/SEG Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC) as a case study, we illustrate a systematic approach to gather useful competitive intelligence information and communicate findings from a technical conference to various internal stakeholders (business units, research, laboratory). We utilize a hybrid approach involving statistical data mining and soliciting curated input from subject matter experts during the conference life-cycle (before, during, after). Our approach relies on easy-to-use templates for practitioners to apply the methods described in this paper. Broadly, our process flow is: (1) Identify important talks (2) Ensure proper attendance levels to cover key talks but not overload people (3) Synthesize the most important technical content (automated and human-derived) (4) Balance stakeholder needs (business versus centralized researchers) (5) Use data mining/data analytics to discover key technology and partnerships trends (6) Disseminate condensed learnings for business consumption. We found that our systematic approach maximized the value of attending URTeC with respect to the significant people-hours and direct financial costs invested in the effort because it simplified an otherwise unstructured and overwhelming effort (akin to herding cats) into a series of smaller more manageable decisions to enable a coherent dissemination of technical information to the business. Based on 5+ years of organized competitive intelligence gathering at URTeC, we recommend giving attendees (especially business and laboratory) more flexibility to interact with vendors/speakers. We resisted the temptation to ""over-book"" attendees with assigned talks and allowed almost two-thirds free time to capitalize on ""day of"" opportunities. The tangible outcomes of our ""playbook"" include the following: (1) Dominant technical topics (via text data mining) and their evolution through time (2) Paper ""market share"" plots vs time to track overall industry participation levels and identify the dominant conference participants (3) Affiliation mapping to identify partnerships (IOC's, universities, service companies, independents) (4) Efficient scheme to manage personnel time (w/different objectives and priorities) (5) Communicating company benchmarking for key technology topics (value versus relative skill against competitors) (6) Templates/procedures that could be adapted for other technical conferences. We believe strategic coordination of conference attendance will benefit the broader industry and that sharing our URTeC ""playbook"" can aid companies in developing and improving their own conference participation. Increased budgetary scrutiny has encouraged streamlining of conference participation for competitive intelligence analysis. Our personal experience affirms the value of integrating partners such as library science professionals with technical experts for formal upstream technology benchmarking and competitive intelligence gathering via technical conferences.

"Research on conceptual models for coal mine safety management rely on data mining. Text mining of big data is used to extract the laws and rules that are implied in safety models, making these laws and rules more transparent by stating them explicitly and providing visualization. Currently, the ability to process information on coal mine safety management is insufficient for resolving the problems of inefficiency and a lack of knowledge. In this paper, based on a knowledge map service, the analysis of coal mine safety maps for management purposes and the acquisition of situational factors in a multidimensional space for innovation is divided into the current situation and the expectations hidden in the data. Multidimensional situations and the role of each component's situation require specific analysis and discussion of the issues of human-computer interactions and situations. Five levels of users' spatial knowledge demand are proposed and analyzed by combining the coal mine safety demand, multidimensional situational factors and spatial knowledge map service system. The service process model of user space knowledge acquisition and the organizational structure of the service system are constructed. Then, the coal mine safety text is classified, and a self-adaptive weight deep learning classification algorithm is used to classify the coal mine safety knowledge data to verify the difference in the classification effect of two classification algorithms. Finally, based on the correct classification of coal mine safety knowledge data, the mining of hazard association rules is performed. From the perspectives of knowledge workers, knowledge bases, and the combination of knowledge workers and knowledge bases, the mode of knowledge analysis of coal mine safety maps and its specific applications in intelligent searches, knowledge sharing and knowledge optimization are discussed.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Online communities of involuntary celibates (incels) are a prominent source of misogynist hate speech. In this paper, we use quantitative text and network analysis approaches to examine how identity groups are discussed on incels.is, the largest black-pilled incels forum. We find that this community produces a wide range of novel identity terms and, while terms for women are most common, mentions of other minoritized identities are increasing. An analysis of the associations made with identity groups suggests an essentialist ideology where physical appearance, as well as gender and racial hierarchies, determine human value. We discuss implications for research into automated misogynist hate speech detection. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Disability in people is a reality that has always been present throughout humanity and all nations of the planet are immersed in this reality. Being communication and interaction through technology much more important than ever, people with disabilities are the most affected by having a physical gap. There are still few tools that these people can use to interact more easily with different types of hardware, therefore, we want to provide them a playful and medical tool that can adapt to their needs and allow them to interact a little more with the people around them. From this context, we have decided to focus on people with motor disabilities of the upper limbs and based on this, we propose the use of gamification in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) area, developing a videogame consisting of three voice-operated minigames. This work has 4 stages: analysis (benchmarking), design, development and validation. In the first stage, we elaborated a benchmarking of the models. In the second stage, we describe the implementation of CNNs, together with methods such as gamification and NLP for problem solving. In the third stage, the corresponding mini-games which compose the videogame and its characteristics are described. Finally, in the last stage, the application of the videogame was validated with experts in physiotherapy. Our results show that with the training performed, the prediction of words with noise was improved from 43.49% to 74.50% and of words without noise from 63.87% to 96.36%. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda."
"With the development of information technology, the increasing amount of content on the web has made aspect-based sentiment analysis an essential tool for extracting information about emotional states. However, most of the existing work focuses on a single text, while little attention is paid to the task of sentiment analysis in complex texts such as dialogues, in which the quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment may appear in different speakers during one conversation thread. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that was built by a Chinese pre-trained language model and a grid tagging classifier. In addition, we use multi-view interaction with three consecutive multi-head attention modules to improve the performance and robustness of our model. Besides, based on the excellent performance of the Chinese pre-training model, the English version is transferred from the final Chinese weights to achieve cross-lingual transfer. To improve the generalization ability of the model, cross-validation is used to select the best one. Our model ranks first on track 4 of the NLPCC-2023 shared task on conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple analysis.

"The paper presents a brief review of intelligent interfaces and systems of human-machine interaction. To date, few intelligent interfaces and systems are used in various areas of industry. All the systems of human-machine interaction can be divided into intelligent synthesis and analysis systems. Intelligent synthesis implies the presentation of information from the system to the user. Aiming at presenting information from a person to a system, intelligent analysis is based on state-of-the-art predictive neural networks such as Transformer models with attention mechanisms. Meanwhile, intelligent synthesis is based on generative neural networks designed to generate video, audio and text information for various tasks. The paper briefly describes state-of-the-art methods in this area, as well as provides an overview of existing freely available systems for generating and analyzing uni- and multimodal information. The paper also focuses on recent research results of the Speech and Multimodal Interfaces Laboratory of SPC RAS in this field, as well as presents some methods for solving actual tasks of intelligent analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Every day, millions worldwide communicate thanks to the Internet and social media. Consequently, there are now more channels available for sharing knowledge with others. The field of sentiment analysis (SA) has come into the spotlight over the past decade. However, As a result of their online interaction, people generate vast amounts of dialogue every second. During a conversation, it is possible to gather valuable information from the participants’ emotions. Using Sentiment Analysis for Natural Language Processing (NLP), any text may be analyzed and summarized. Other languages, such as English, have well-developed libraries and tools for natural language processing, but studies have yet to be undertaken on the Moroccan context utilizing French social media commentary. Consequently, it opens up several study opportunities. Consequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Adaboost classifier (AC), and Logistic Regression (LR) were employed. Positive and negative labels were assigned to data collected from the dataset. In addition, a model for ensemble-based sentiment analysis was developed; in contrast to other machine learning classifiers cited before, we achieved better performance in terms of accuracy, kappa, precision, recall, and F1-score. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Political candidates choose to highlight morality in their campaign speeches in various ways. In particular, we expect presidential candidates to highlight moral principles in introducing themselves to voters early in the campaign. However, usage may not be the same across candidates. Existing research suggests that, in general, women focus on different moral values than men. The question is whether such findings in the mass public translate into rhetorical differences between men and women presidential candidates. We know little about whether such gender differences exist, and if so, how they might influence voters. We examine a unique data set of presidential candidate speeches given in Iowa in the 2016 and 2020 nomination campaigns, developing and testing hypotheses about gender, the use of moral language, and its effects on vote outcomes. Using automated text analysis, we find that all else equal, while women candidates do not use more moral language overall, they do emphasize care and fairness more than men, and in doing so, they may be disadvantaging themselves, especially when using language related to fairness. © 2023 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress."
"Deep learning models are dominating almost all artificial intelligence tasks such as vision, text, and speech processing. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the main tool for training such models, where the computations are usually performed in single-precision floating-point number format. The convergence of single-precision SGD is normally aligned with the theoretical results of real numbers since they exhibit negligible error. Flow- ever. the numerical error increases when the computations are performed in low-precision number formats. This provides compelling reasons to study the SGD convergence adapted for low-precision computations. We present both deterministic and stochastic analysis of the SGD algorithm, obtaining bounds that show the effect of number format. Such bounds can provide guidelines as to how SGD convergence is affected when constraints render the possibility of performing high-precision computations remote. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda."
"The steady increase in computational gender bias research has been mostly done on languages for which reliable NLP packages are readily available - such as English, Chinese, and Spanish. This study expands on this area of research by using word embedding bias analysis methods in the Philippine context. To this end, Philippine media textual corpora consisting of 380 million English words and 921 million Filipino words were compiled and used to train FastText embeddings. These embeddings were then subjected to validation and to the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) to characterize bias in the embeddings and in the texts they were trained in. Results show that Filipino texts are associated with the heterosexual male by default, but strongest biases relate to the female and the non-heterosexual. Meanwhile, media texts written in English generally have more balanced gender associations compared to texts written in Filipino. Furthermore, the Filipino corpus links action more to the male and objects and social roles to the female. On the other hand, implicitly gendered words in English texts are mostly nouns. These results contribute to demonstrations of how WEAT can be applied in low-resource languages, such as Filipino.  © 2023 IEEE."

"The automated detection of harmful language has been of great importance for the online world, especially with the growing importance of social media and, consequently, polarisation. There are many open challenges to high quality detection of harmful text, from dataset creation to generalisable application, thus calling for more systematic studies. In this paper, we explore re-annotation as a means of examining the robustness of already existing labelled datasets, showing that, despite using alternative definitions, the inter-annotator agreement remains very inconsistent, highlighting the intrinsically subjective and variable nature of the task. In addition, we build automatic toxicity detectors using the existing datasets, with their original labels, and we evaluate them on our multi-definition and multi-source datasets. Surprisingly, while other studies show that hate speech detection models perform better on data that are derived from the same distribution as the training set, our analysis demonstrates this is not necessarily true. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"Purpose: The paper aims to search for means and methods of developing a visual culture in university students in the discipline of “History of Fine Art.” The research objects are the pedagogical mechanisms that influence the development of the visual culture of young people. Methodology: The study is of world outlook, culturological, and aesthetic nature. It represents a sociological analysis of several issues: what factors influence the development of visual culture and what objective and subjective conditions are necessary for this; whether art is a contemporary means of communication, information, and cognitive sphere, which forms social activity and spiritual and aesthetic positions; whether young people have structural and functional methods and skills of critical analysis or their ways of knowing the world are prejudicial. The paper analyzes visual culture as an important component of social, behavioral, and cognitive activity and emotional and aesthetic experience of evaluation, in which the individual can master new possibilities and methods of analysis, perception, and interpretation of information, texts, and images. Results: On the one hand, the authors identify shortcomings and cause-effect relationships that lead to a change in the vision and understanding of information by students. On the other hand, these changes serve as a promising model for developing visual activity, designing and implementing search, creative, and interactive methods in the educational process of higher education. These methods allow the individual to interact with the environment and contribute to a personal understanding of the information and knowledge received, playing a significant role in developing emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and motivational spheres. The obtained results indicate a change in the forms of cultural inclusion and the individual’s visual abilities, as well as in the development of a new visual paradigm based on the integration of human-computer interaction. Practical relevance: During the experiment, indicators of the development of visual culture were determined. Various research activities were carried out, including questionnaires, tests, discussions, practical conferences, master classes, and virtual tours, which prove the relevance of visual culture. Additionally, the authors reviewed scientific articles by Russian and foreign authors relating to the spiritual and aesthetic demands of society, current trends in art, and means of creative development of the individual. © 2023 Brill Academic Publishers.

"The aim of this paper is to analyse the correlation between women writers and language, as a social construct strongly correlated to diastratic and diaphasic factors. This study will examine Matilde Serao’s (xixst century Italian female writer and journalist) awareness about the existence of a “women’s language” in women’s novels. The research starts from sociolinguistic surveys, which have revealed the existence of a set of expectations held by a community of speakers regarding the linguistic behaviours attributed to gender. The analysis applies to the novel a set of prototypical features of “women’s language”, according to speakers’ expectation, and some linguistic phenomena (divided on the bases of different linguistic levels, such as morpho-phonological, syntactic, and pragmatic-textual) for each one of these traits. The linguistic examination has been performed with GATE, an open-source software used for the development of Information Extraction system. Thanks to the data obtained it is possible to compare the occurrences of each prototypical feature with all the others linguistic possibilities available to express the same concept. The relative frequency of the linguistic phenomena demonstrates that they depend on an intersection of variables such as gender, diastratic and diaphasic factors. It is very important to focus on the difference between sex and gender. As a matter of fact, the existing literature on the subject has proven there are no differences in masculine and feminine language dependent on sex, meant as biological factor. Instead, there can be differences depending on gender, in the sense of a factor constructed on social and historical phenomena. © 2023 Fabrizio Serra Editore Srl. All rights reserved."
"Customer service has become crucial for every organization looking to grow and improve its clientele in today’s cutthroat marketplace. Companies cannot afford to fall short of consumer expectations. With the recent progress in Artificial Intelligence, companies have adopted AI techniques like sentiment analysis to measure customer satisfaction. Chatbots are the foundation for most AI applications in call centers trained for either question-answering tasks or calculating sentiment out of user feedback via surveys. These existing expert systems only utilize text mining techniques to classify sentiment as positive or negative. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal learning framework for tackling the sentiment classification task, employing acoustic and linguistic modalities from real-world conversations between support representatives and customers and survey feedback data using the decision-level fusion technique. Leveraging the classification abilities and feature representations from both modalities, our model achieves the best results amongst all implementations and enables us to better analyze the sentiment expressed by the user than using a single modality like text or audio. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Classifying spinal cord tumours from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a multidomain task, which involves segmentation of tumour regions, representation of these regions into feature vectors, design of region-specific classifiers, and post-processing techniques. Existing tumour detection models either showcase low-segmentation efficiency, or have higher complexity when evaluated on differential-position MRI scans. Moreover, the accuracy of these models reduces w.r.t. number of disease classes. To overcome these issues, this text proposes design of an efficient bioinspired multidomain feature processing model for classification of spinal cord tumours via convolutional networks. The proposed model initially segments spinal cord images via masked-region augmented Convolutional Neural Network (MRA CNN), which assists in efficient identification of tumour-specific regions. These regions are represented into multidomain features via frequency analysis, Gabor analysis, entropy analysis, Wavelet analysis, and convolution analysis. These feature sets are processed via a Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which assists in identification of highly variant feature sets, which are classified into 'tumour' or 'non-tumour' types via a Binary CNN (BCNN) process. This process segregates feature vectors into groups of binary classes by maintaining an epitome common class across these sets. The BCNN uses a majority function to identify tumours, which improves the accuracy of classification by 3.9%, precision by 2.5%, recall by 2.8%, and reduce delay by 4.5% when compared with existing tumour detection techniques.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This article describes solutions to couple of problems: CMU-MOSEI database preprocessing to improve data quality and bimodal multitask classification of emotions and sentiments. With the help of experimental studies, representative features for acoustic and linguistic information are identified among pretrained neural networks with Transformer architecture. The most representative features for the analysis of emotions and sentiments are EmotionHuBERT and RoBERTa for audio and text modalities respectively. The article establishes a baseline for bimodal multitask recognition of sentiments and emotions – 63.2% and 61.3%, respectively, measured with macro F-score. Experiments were conducted with different approaches to combining modalities – concatenation and multi-head attention. The most effective architecture of neural network with early concatenation of audio and text modality and late multi-head attention for emotions and sentiments recognition is proposed. The proposed neural network is combined with logistic regression, which achieves 63.5% and 61.4% macro F-score by bimodal (audio and text) multitasking recognition of 3 sentiment classes and 6 emotion binary classes. © Dialogue 2023.All rights reserved."
"Research data serves important roles in scientific discovery and academic innovation. To appropriately assign credit for data work and to measure the value of research data, it is essential to articulate how data are actually used in research. We leveraged a combination of computational methods and human analysis to characterize different types of data use by mining semantic relations from the phrases where data are referenced in academic literature. In particular, we investigated references to data in the bibliography of a large social science data archive, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). After retrieving and extracting semantic relations as subject-relation-object triples, we used rule-based methods to classify them. We then annotated samples from 11 frequent classes of data reference triples and found that they vary primarily along two dimensions of data use: proximity and function. Proximity describes the distance between the author and the data they reference (e.g., direct or indirect engagement). Function describes the role that data plays in each reference (e.g., describing interaction or providing context). These semantic relationships between authors and data reveal the ways data are used in scientific publications. Evidence of the variety of ways data are used can help stakeholders in research data curation and stewardship - including data providers, data curators, and data users - recognize the myriad ways that their investments in data sharing are realized.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Adhering to long-termism is essential for sustaining and promoting corporate innovation in the face of future uncertainty. In this study, we use machine learning and text analysis methods to construct a proxy variable for managerial long-termism and explore how managerial long-termism affects corporate innovation using a sample of 13,117 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2020 in China. We find managerial long-termism has a positive effect on corporate innovation, which is mainly achieved by mitigating agency problems. The positive effect of managerial long-termism on corporate innovation is more pronounced when an enterprise faces stronger economic policy uncertainty and has more slack resources. Additional analysis shows that managerial long-termism accelerates exploratory innovation and contributes to the high-quality development of enterprises. Our findings advance research on long-termism in corporate governance and generate meaningful insights into the antecedents of corporate innovation from the perspective of time preference. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Disaster Management, defined as a coordinated social effort to successfully prepare for and respond to disasters, can benefit greatly as an industrial process from modern Deep Learning methods. Disaster prevention organizations can benefit greatly from the processing of disaster response data. In an attempt to detect and subsequently categorise disaster-related information from tweets via tweet text analysis, a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a Convolutional Neural Network, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM), as well as several Transformer-based network architectures, namely BERT, DistilBERT, Albert, RoBERTa and DeBERTa, are employed. The two defined main tasks of the work presented in this paper are: (1) distinguishing tweets into disaster related and non relevant ones, and (2) categorising already labeled disaster tweets into eight predefined natural disaster categories. These supported types of natural disasters are earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, explosions, volcano eruptions and general disasters. To achieve this goal, several accessible related datasets are collected and combined to suit the two tasks. In addition, the combination of preprocessing tasks that is most beneficial for inference is investigated. Finally, experiments have been conducted using bias mitigation techniques. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda."
"In the oil and gas industry, drilling activities spawn substantial volumes of unstructured textual data. The examination and interpretation of these data pose significant challenges. This research exploits the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with over 100 billion parameters to extract actionable insights from raw drilling data. Through fine-tuning methodologies and the use of various prompt engineering strategies, we addressed several text downstream tasks, including summarization, classification, entity recognition, and information extraction. This study delves into our methods, findings, and the novel application of LLMs for efficient and precise analysis of drilling data. Copyright © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Devanagari is an ancient script that is used to write Hindi, Nepali, Marathi, Maithili, Awadhi, Newari, and Bhojpuri, among other Indo-Aryan languages. Thousands of individuals in India use this script to write documents in Marathi and Hindi. Indian mythology is based on this script. Because of the script's prominence, handwritten Devanagari character identification has grown in popularity over time. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of different machine learning and deep learning models for Devanagari character recognition. MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP) Mixer is the technology we're using because extensive research has been done in Devanagari Text Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). This paper aims to provide a comparison between traditional models and a newer model(MLP Mixer). We have used CNN as a standalone deep learning model for our problem and used it for feature extraction. We have also developed some traditional machine learning classifiers using these learned complex features.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Speech language pathologists rely on information spanning the layers of language, often drawing from multiple layers (e.g. phonology & semantics) at once. Recent innovations in large language models (LLMs) have been shown to build powerful representations for many complex language structures, especially syntax and semantics, unlocking the potential of large datasets through self-supervised learning techniques. However, these datasets are overwhelmingly orthographic, favoring writing systems like the English alphabet, a natural but phonetically imprecise choice. Meanwhile, LLM support for the international phonetic alphabet (IPA) ranges from poor to absent. Further, LLMs encode text at a word- or near-word level, and pre-training tasks have little to gain from phonetic/phonemic representations. In this paper, we introduce BORT, an LLM for mixed orthography/IPA meant to overcome these limitations. To this end, we extend the pre-training of an existing LLM with our own self-supervised pronunciation tasks. We then fine-tune for a clinical task that requires simultaneous phonological and semantic analysis. For an “easy” and “hard” version of these tasks, we show that fine-tuning from our models is more accurate by a relative 24% and 29%, and improves on character error rates by a relative 75% and 31%, respectively, than those starting from the original model. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Through this text, we aim to better understand the expression of subjective, ethical and aesthetic experiences of Sufi women living in Montreal, all while identifying the dynamic interactions between the key concepts they foreground. These concepts seem to form a conceptual constellation that, for these women, makes up a grid of interpretation of the world and a guide on how to act in this world. Would such a hermeneutic action, which fuses conceptualization and the experiential in the day-to-day, participate both in the construction of the self and a co-existence where difference and otherness would fall under the scope of theophany and sanctity? This is the key question we ask here. We essentially rely on qualitative data. The analysis of this data allows us to see that unpardonable atrocities, perpetrated in the world in the name of Islam by a small, violent, radical minority, organized into murderous militants and reticent to any form of otherness, should not obscure the existence of an Islam of co-existence where the Other is subject to ennoblement. © 2023 University of Toronto.

"In the era of digital transformation, the information used for strategic management in schools needs to be utilized for maximum benefit, efficiency, and effectiveness. Further, it requires storage in a secure, transparent, and verifiable manner worldwide. Recognizing the importance of this research contribution, the researchers designed a strategic data storage and analysis system to be used in larger secondary schools by integrating big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies. The integrated system provides a platform to collect and analyze annual operational plans for schools by facilitating compatibility with text analytics and machine learning technologies of large, high-security schools in Thailand. The results showed that the plans and projects for each department in the school were encrypted at the time of login, and the system generated a starting block. Through each step of the corresponding analysis process, new blocks are created continuously, meaning each plan and project will generate a chain of blocks encrypted with the hash function until the plan and project are approved. Furthermore, the system has a high level of security and user satisfaction (X-= 4.00, SD. 0.76)). Thus, the system could be implemented and adopted in schools to support educational management in the 21st century. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Background: Beta-2 transferrin (B2-Tf) gel electrophoresis (GE) is the preferred non-invasive diagnostic modality for confirming cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in body fluids. While B2-Tf GE testing is highly sensitive and specific for CSF, false-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) results can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Several series have demonstrated potential causes of false B2-Tf GE results, but few studies have reported reasons for these errors. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe sources of B2-Tf GE errors. Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching OVID, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases for B2-Tf GE studies. After applying exclusion criteria, original research studies directly addressing erroneous B2-Tf GE results underwent qualitative analysis. Results: Of the 243 abstracts screened, 71 underwent full-text review and 18 studies reporting B2-Tf GE errors were included for analysis. There were 15 potential FPs, 12 actual FPs, 12 potential FNs, 19 actual FNs, and 14 indeterminate results. There were also 246 potentially indeterminate results from in vitro studies. Reasons for B2-Tf GE errors included serum transferrin alterations (n = 17; all potential), infection related (n = 13; 9 potential), orbital or salivary contamination (n = 2; 1 potential), and collection related (n = 255; 246 potential). There were 31 false or indeterminate results with unspecified reasons. There were no reported errors due to laboratory processing. Conclusions: Multiple potential or actual reasons for false or indeterminate results have been reported for B2-Tf GE testing of rhinorrhea and otorrhea. Future studies should explore reasons for B2-Tf testing errors and how these may affect clinical decision making. © 2023 ARS-AAOA, LLC."
"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is a condition that often requires urgent treatment. Although guidelines have recommendations regarding chronic rate control therapy, recommendations on the best choice for acute heart rate (HR) control in RVR are unclear. Methods: A systematic search across multiple databases was performed for studies evaluating the outcome of HR control (defined as HR less than 110 bpm and/or 20% decrease from baseline HR). Included studies evaluated AF and/or AFL with RVR in a hospital setting, with direct comparison between intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol and excluded cardiac surgery and catheter ablation patients. Hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) was measured as a secondary outcome. Two authors performed full-text article review and extracted data, with a third author mediating disagreements. Random effects models utilizing inverse variance weighting were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 test. Results: A total of 563 unique titles were identified through the systematic search, of which 16 studies (7 randomized and 9 observational) were included. In our primary analysis of HR control by study type, IV diltiazem was found to be more effective than IV metoprolol for HR control in randomized trials (OR 4.75, 95% CI 2.50–9.04 with I 2 = 14%); however, this was not found for observational studies (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89–1.80 with I 2 = 55%). In an analysis of observational studies, there were no significant differences between the two drugs in odds of hypotension (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.51–2.45 with I 2 = 18%). Conclusion: While there was a trend toward improved HR control with IV diltiazem compared with IV metoprolol in randomized trials, this was not seen in observational studies, and there was no observed difference in hypotension between the two drugs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Starting in the 1990s, digital humanists have endeavored to create the “macroscope,” a holistic research environment that allows for a flexible, multiscalar reading of large text corpora. Many macroscopes have since emerged, from fields as diverse as Danish folklore studies, English literary studies, and Chinese biographical studies. But in creating Silloker, we are the first to offer a “historian’s macroscope” for premodern Korean chronicles. Silloker is a digital platform that opens creative avenues into studying Korea’s Chosŏn dynasty (1392–1910). Its title takes after Chosŏn ŭ wangjo sillok (“Veritable Records of the Chosŏn Dynasty” 朝鮮王朝實錄), court annals that cover five centuries and topics as varied as diplomacy, economy, religion, quotidian life, and natural phenomena. For this archive and others—for example, Diaries of the Royal Secretariat 承政院日記 (Sŭngjŏngw ŏn ilgi), Records of the Border Defense Council 備邊司謄錄 (Pibyŏnsa tungnŏk)—our platform features new search capacities and tools for exploratory data analysis. First, it allows users to make unified queries across multiple archives and download the search results. Second, it offers a tool for aggregating and graphing the frequency of search hits throughout the five-centuries long dynasty, generating real-time results in table and graph. This essay introduces Silloker, its functionalities, and data architecture. It then provides an example case study of the Little Ice Age in Korea to demonstrate the platform’s utility for historical research. Korean Studies © 2023 by University of Hawai‘i Press.

"As pointed out by several scholars, current research on hate speech (HS) recognition is characterized by unsystematic data creation strategies and diverging annotation schemata. Subsequently, supervised-learning models tend to generalize poorly to datasets they were not trained on, and the performance of the models trained on datasets labeled using different HS taxonomies cannot be compared. To ease this problem, we propose to apply extremely weak supervision that only relies on the class name rather than on class samples from the annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art weakly-supervised text classification model in various in-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the source of poor generalizability of HS classification models. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Arabic sentiment analysis has become an important research field in recent years. Initially, work focused on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the most widely used form. Since then, work has been carried out on several different dialects, including Egyptian, Levantine and Moroccan. Moreover, a number of data sets have been created to support such work. However, up until now, no work has been carried out on Sudanese Arabic, a dialect which has 32 million speakers. In this article, two new public data sets are introduced, the two-class Sudanese Sentiment Data set (SudSenti2) and the three-class Sudanese Sentiment Data set (SudSenti3). In the preparation phase, we establish a Sudanese stopword list. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, Sentiment Convolutional MMA (SCM), is proposed, comprising five CNN layers together with a novel Mean Max Average (MMA) pooling layer, to extract the best features. This SCM model is applied to SudSenti2 and SudSenti3 and shown to be superior to the baseline models, with accuracies of 92.25% and 85.23% (Experiments 1 and 2). The performance of MMA is compared with Max, Avg and Min and shown to be better on SudSenti2, the Saudi Sentiment Data set and the MSA Hotel Arabic Review Data set by 1.00%, 0.83% and 0.74%, respectively (Experiment 3). Next, we conduct an ablation study to determine the contribution to performance of text normalisation and the Sudanese stopword list (Experiment 4). For normalisation, this makes a difference of 0.43% on two-class and 0.45% on three-class. For the custom stoplist, the differences are 0.82% and 0.72%, respectively. Finally, the model is compared with other deep learning classifiers, including transformer-based language models for Arabic, and shown to be comparable for SudSenti2 (Experiment 5). © The Author(s) 2023."
"As the Internet has evolved, the exposure and widespread adoption of social media concepts have altered the way news is formed and published. With the help of social media, getting news is cheaper, faster, and easier. However, this has also led to an increase in the number of fake news articles, either by manipulating the text or morphing the images. The spread of fake news has become a serious issue all over the world. In one case, at least 20 people were killed just because of false information that was circulated over a social media platform. This makes it clear that social media sites need a system that uses more than one method to spot fake news stories. To solve this problem, we've come up with FakeRevealer, a single-configuration fake news detection system that works on transfer learning based techniques. Our multi-modal archutecture understands the textual features using a language transformer model called DistilRoBERTa and image features are extracted using the Vision Transformer (ViTs) that is pre-trained on ImageNet 2IK. After feature extraction, a cosine similarity measure is used to fuse both the features. The evaluation of our proposed framework is done over publicly available twitter dataset and results shows that it outperforms current state-of-art on twitter dataset with an accuracy of 80.00% which is 2.23%more, that than the current state-of-art on twitter dataset. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda."
"Conducting sentiment analysis on a large amount of comment text is an important means of extracting potential information from the text. However, existing aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks face difficulties in effectively capturing the associations between words and thus cannot accurately extract aspect words, they also do not fully utilize contextual semantic features, which overlooks the connection between aspect words and the context. This study proposes an aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on the BiLSTM-GateCNN network. First, we integrate the self-attention mechanism into the BiLSTM layer to obtain sentence feature representations and aspect term information. Then, we use the GateCNN network with multiple filters in the convolution layer to effectively extract feature information for multiple aspects in each receiving field. Finally, the gated unit simultaneously generates aspect features and sentiment features, making the text more discriminative in emotion classification. By testing the proposed model on Restaurant domain reviews of the SemEval2016 benchmark dataset, experimental results showed that our proposed sentiment analysis model has achieved significantly better accuracy than the baseline model.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Image caption technology aims to convert visual features of images, extracted by computers, into meaningful semantic information. Therefore, the computers can generate text descriptions that resemble human perception, enabling tasks such as image classification, retrieval, and analysis. In recent years, the performance of image caption has been significantly enhanced with the introduction of encoder-decoder architecture in machine translation and the utilization of deep neural networks. However, several challenges still persist in this domain. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to address the issue of visual information loss and non-dynamic adjustment of input images during decoding. We introduce a guided decoding network that establishes a connection between the encoding and decoding parts. Through this connection, encoding information can provide guidance to the decoding process, facilitating automatic adjustment of the decoding information. In addition, Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) are adopted in the image encoder, and Nested Long Short-Term Memory (NLSTM) is utilized as the decoder to enhance the extraction and parsing capability of image information during the encoding and decoding process. In order to further improve the performance of our image caption model, this study incorporates an attention mechanism to focus details and constructs a double-layer decoding structure, which facilitates the enhancement of the model in terms of providing more detailed descriptions and enriched semantic information. Furthermore, the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is employed to train the model by directly optimizing the identical set of evaluation indexes, which solves the problem of inconsistent training and evaluation standards. Finally, the model is trained and tested on MS COCO and Flickr 30 k datasets, and the results show that the model has improved compared with commonly used models in the evaluation indicators such as BLEU, METEOR and CIDEr.

"Background: Fluid resuscitation is routinely needed for critically ill patients. However, the optimal choice between crystalloids and normal saline is in heat debate. Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis comparing normal saline and balanced crystalloids in the treatment of critically ill patients with composite mortality as the primary outcome. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to March 2022. Studies of critically ill adult patients assigned to receive normal saline or balanced crystalloids were included. We conducted a meta-analysis using an inverse variance, random-effects model in addition to trial sequential analysis (TSA). The primary outcome was composite mortality. Subgroup analyses were also conducted. Results: Eighteen full-text studies (n=36,224) were included. Balanced crystalloids were associated with lower mortality compared with normal saline (risk ratio [RR]=0.96; 95% confidential interval [CI] 0.93, 1; p=0.03; I2 =0) and lower incidence of acute kidney injury/acute renal failure (RR =0.93; 95% CI = 0.87, 0.99; p=0.03). No significant difference was observed in other outcomes. In the sepsis patients, the balanced crystalloid showed a lower composite mortality rate compared with normal saline (RR =0.91; 95% CI = 0.85, 0.99; p=0.02). TSA analysis demonstrated that, with 80% power, the effect of balanced crystalloid is not larger than a 10% relative decrease in composite mortality compared with normal saline. Conclusion and Relevance: This study demonstrated that balanced crystalloids could be an optimal choice over normal saline in critically ill patients to a reduced composite mortality rate. In patients with sepsis, the difference is especially significant. Nonetheless, the optimal resuscitation fluid option between saline and balanced crystalloid solutions should be investigated further with more evidence. © 2023 Chen and Gao."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been a hot research topic due to its ability to fully exploit people’s opinions through social media texts. Compared with analyzing sentiment in short texts, conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple analysis, also known as DiaASQ, aiming to extract the sentiment quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment in a dialogue, is a relatively new task that involves multiple speakers with varying stances in a conversation. Conversations are longer than ordinary texts and have richer contexts, which can lead to context loss and pairing errors. To address this issue, this work proposes a context-fusion encoding method based on conversation threads and lengths to integrate the speech of different speakers, enabling the model to better understand conversational context and extract cross-utterance quadruples. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves an average F1-score of 42.12% in DiaASQ, which is 6.48% higher than the best comparative model, indicating superior performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"For monitoring crises, political events are extracted from the news. The large amount of unstructured full-text event descriptions makes a case-by-case analysis unmanageable, particularly for low-resource humanitarian aid organizations. This creates a demand to classify events into event types, a task referred to as event coding. Typically, domain experts craft an event type ontology, annotators label a large dataset and technical experts develop a supervised coding system. In this work, we propose PR-ENT1, a new event coding approach that is more flexible and resource-efficient, while maintaining competitive accuracy: first, we extend an event description such as “Military injured two civilians” by a template, e.g. “People were [Z]” and prompt a pre-trained (cloze) language model to fill the slot Z. Second, we select suitable answer candidates Z∗ = {“injured”, “hurt”...} by treating the event description as premise and the filled templates as hypothesis in a textual entailment task. In a final step, the selected answer candidate can be mapped to its corresponding event type. This allows domain experts to draft the codebook directly as labeled prompts and interpretable answer candidates. This human-in-the-loop process is guided by our codebook design tool2. We show that our approach is robust through several checks: perturbing the event description and prompt template, restricting the vocabulary and removing contextual information. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"The subject of this article is an analysis of the re pre sen ta tion of the nineteenth century in Václav Vokolek’s mul ti threa ded prose work Dominový efekt. The work can be regarded as a specific continuation of the work Cesta do pekel, especially if the pictorial perspective and the conviction that humanity is in a network of secret organisations, conspiracies and, nowadays, various systems are regarded as common points. In this text, the focus is mainly on the reconstruc tion of the figure of Ernst Gustav Doerell, a 19th-century landscape painter of Northern Bohemia, whose paintings reflected the changes taking place in the natural landscape of the region. Using the historical prototype in part, Vokolek offers the reader a post modern game through which he can take the conviction of the omnipotence of the secret systems that rule the world to our present day and even look into the near future. © 2023 Polska Akademia Nauk.

"The procedure of analyzing and integrating text information from cutting descriptions collected during drilling process with formation evaluation models is a tedious task that is demanding in terms of time and human labor. The work describes a process to automate the task and use it to identify hydrocarbon zones in exploration wells. As the drill bit penetrates the formations in a well, the rock fragments are usually described across the associated depth of interest in a text format. These descriptions are valuable source of information that are usually compared to petrophysical models that uses wireline logs as input. In this work, textual cutting descriptions are utilized in identifying potential hydrocarbon zones using natural language processing and deep learning algorithms. The methodology uses natural language processing techniques to generate data set. The data set is used to train a deep learning algorithm to identify hydrocarbon zone from cutting descriptions automatically. The system has been used to identify hydrocarbon zones in a group of exploration wells. The trained model has been applied to blind test wells. The methodology reached hydrocarbon detection accuracy of 98% in challenging areas. For example, it allows hydrocarbon detection in low resistivity pay reservoirs where Archie's based saturation calculations present a water wet zone. The result was confirmed by formation tester and testing results suggesting the correctness of the technique. Moreover, the automation reduces the turnover time of such analysis and reduces human error. The enclosed process helps in integrating textual information into the petrophysical model to reduce uncertainty, human labor, and aid in identifying hydrocarbon zones. In addition, the method will reduce the need for unnecessary testing, resulting in cost saving in rig time operation. Copyright © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."
"Structured Sentiment Analysis (SSA) aims to extract the complete sentiment structure from a given text. Existing approaches predominantly rely on the interactions of words to predict the relationships between sentiment elements. While these methods have shown effectiveness, they overlook the rich label semantics associated with SSA tasks and necessitate extensive task-specific designs. In order to address the above problems, we propose a generative framework for tackling the SSA task. We designed two templates to transform the SSA task into a text generation problem, which facilitate the training process by formulating the SSA task as a text generation problem. Through experiments conducted on three SSA datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed generative approach outperforms all existing methods, thereby highlighting the advantages of employing the generative model for SSA. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Due to the rapid movement of players, ice hockey is a high-speed sport that poses significant challenges for player tracking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for player identification and tracking in ice hockey games, utilising deep neural networks trained on actual gameplay data. Player detection, identification, and tracking are the three main components of our architecture. The player detection component detects individuals in an image sequence using a region proposal technique. The player identification component makes use of a text detector model that performs character recognition on regions containing text detected by a scene text recognition model, enabling us to resolve ambiguities caused by players from the same squad having similar appearances. After identifying the players, a visual multi-object tracking model is used to track their movements throughout the game. Experiments conducted with data collected from actual ice hockey games demonstrate the viability of our proposed framework for tracking and identifying players in real-world settings. Our framework achieves an average precision (AP) of 67.3 and a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 80.2 for player detection and tracking, respectively. In addition, our team identification and player number identification accuracy is 82.39% and 87.19%, respectively. Overall, our framework is a significant advancement in the field of player tracking and identification in ice hockey, utilising cutting-edge deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and robustness in the face of complex and fast-paced gameplay. Our framework has the potential to be applied in a variety of applications, including sports analysis, player tracking, and team performance evaluation. Further enhancements can be made to address the challenges posed by complex and cluttered environments and enhance the system’s precision. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"The present study integrates theories of mediated and supportive communication to investigate the influence of communication context (i.e., channel) and content (i.e., quality) on support outcomes. 162 friend-dyads participated in an experiment by engaging in a supportive conversation that occurred either face-to-face, via video chat, or via text messaging and was manipulated to reflect either low- or high-quality support. Results showed channel richness, as operationalized by perceived synchronicity and bandwidth, varied across all three channels, and significantly predicted support receivers’ cognitive reappraisal and emotional improvement. Moderation analyses offered support consistent with the dual process theory of supportive message outcomes, such that the positive relationship between perceived bandwidth and support outcomes diminished as support quality increased. As one of the few experimental studies of enacted support reflecting varying quality levels across three distinct communication channels in the context of established friendships, implications for mediated supportive communication are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The process of extracting and searching for well and field historical data is an essential element in production engineering as it helps capture anomalous events and mitigate measures during critical well operations and analysis. Thus, a new methodology utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to create an advance model to automate this process. This study explores the process of automating exploring artificially lifted well data via the utilization of ML and NLP algorithms. The proposed method introduces an intelligent petroleum engineering system that takes users' input and analyze Electrical Submersible pumps (ESP) wells using an advanced ML and NLP model. Moreover, text extraction, cleaning and validation tasks are initially performed to ensure data quality prior to machine and language modeling. Also, word embedding techniques were used to train the model to learn semantic level relationships such as well and field names. The developed model takes the user's questions and transform them to Structured Query Language (SQL) to be executed on cloud servers and evaluated ESP wells using real time data in order to generate the targeted analysis. The NLP system was implemented utilizing engineers' daily workflows, and evaluated on its ability to retrieve users' targeted results in the data set based on query entered by the users. Moreover, performance of the system on extraction, mapping and mitigation attributes were evaluated using F1 scores performance matrix. Validating and testing the NLP model disclosed a promising outcome. It' is worth noting that the advance NLP system scored significantly high F1 record which indicated high reliability of the model to retrieve critical well information. The developed model enabled engineer in the field to utilize such system to explore and extract targeted results from cloud solutions using advanced ML and NLP algorithms. This yielded significant impact on cost as well as time savings of more than 40% due the system ability to provide engineers with intended results during critical times. The developed NLP model enhanced the way engineers explore and study well historical data as the proposed system lead to a fast and substantial improvement in acquiring a desired result. Also, the system provides a detailed well description and analysis to its users. This resulted in significant money and time saving especially in offshore operations where a fast and reliable data is needed to make critical decision in a timely manner leading into avoiding production losses.

"We study the new problem of automatic question generation (QG) from multi-modal sources containing images and texts, significantly expanding the scope of most of the existing work that focuses exclusively on QG from only textual sources. We propose a simple solution for our new problem, called MultiQG-TI, which enables a text-only question generator to process visual input in addition to textual input. Specifically, we leverage an image-to-text model and an optical character recognition model to obtain the textual description of the image and extract any texts in the image, respectively, and then feed them together with the input texts to the question generator. We only fine-tune the question generator while keeping the other components fixed. On the challenging ScienceQA dataset, we demonstrate that MultiQG-TI significantly outperforms ChatGPT with few-shot prompting, despite having hundred-times less trainable parameters. Additional analyses empirically confirm the necessity of both visual and textual signals for QG and show the impact of various modeling choices.

"This paper considers the question of automating the prediction of the users’ expression of psychological traits, as assessed by the Big Five test. CatBoost is used as a model to automate this process, which as an input receives traits extracted analytically from user posts on personal pages (the average number of words in a sentence, the ratio of the number of emoticons per number of words, the metric of ease of reading text, emotional coloring of text, etc.) and the result of additional training model RuBERT, and as the output label (expression of a factor of the Big Five). The final dataset is 1018 test results and 67052 posts from the pages of users who passed the test. The result of the work showed that the use of the pre-trained RuBERT model greatly improves the predictive model, except it was possible to identify the need to increase the initial data set. The theoretical significance lies in the creation of an approach for the analysis of users’ posts in the context of the possibility to predict their scores in Big Five test. The practical significance determines the creation of an automated system to predict psychological trait severity scores from posts on their personal social media page. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

"A surge in text-based information retrieval such as topic detection and tracking has increasingly shown growth from static to dynamism in the last decade. We posit the need of investigating an interdisciplinary approach of network science and natural language processing for graph-based information extraction. Post-lockdown era. it makes sense to consider Graph of Words (GoW) evolved from user-generated text from social media platforms amid increase in the internet traffic. The idea is to unfold the latent patterns in graph-based text representation with limited resource availability resulting in effective models, in comparison of computationally expensive pre-trained models, limited to a certain type of information extraction. As a solution towards advancing statistical approach for language independent models, we plot three different information retrieval applications: Structural analysis: find unique patterns in domain/ language/ genre-specific GoW for keyword extraction. Language independence: design objective function for language-independent information retrieval, (iii) Dynamism: mathematical modeling for concept-drift and evolving trends/ events in dynamic GoW evolved from streaming data. We associate recent developments and open challenges with our position as potential research direction. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda."
"The relevance of this research topic stems from the efficacy of utilizing simulators to create function headers during programming training, as well as the labor-intensive nature of generating tasks for these simulators when dealing with extensive volumes of available commented program code. Analyzing commented program code enables the extraction of valuable information and data, which serve as the foundation for automating the generation of such tasks. This necessitates the development of suitable approaches, methods, and algorithms for program code analysis and the subsequent generation of tasks based on the acquired data. The development of a generator of function headers creation tasks aims to address the challenges of complexity and labor intensity associated with manual task creation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Based on unpublished archival materials and pieces from epistolary sources, the article restores a history of F.K. Sologub’s cooperation with a popular publishing enterprise at the beginning of the 20th century — Moscow Publishing House. The article analyses business relationships between Sologub and Moscow Publishing House staff members: G.G. Blumenberg, the owner and the editor of the literary digests “Zemlia” (20 books, issued by Moscow Publishing House from 1908 to 1917); D.M. Rebrik, Blumenberg trading house’s authorized representative; Bunin, the editor of the first three books of “Zemlia”; V.S. Klestov, the representative of Moscow Publishing House in St. Petersburg. The article follows the history of Sologub’s art works publications in the literary digest “Zemlia” (short stories “The Old House” and “The Beastly Life,” a novel “Smoke and Ashes”) as well as separate editions of some books (short story collections titled “Fierce Year” (1916) and “The Blind Butterfly” (1918), a collection of poems “Red Poppy” (1917)). Based on the reviews of literary critics, the article proves thematic dialogues between the texts by Sologub and other authors within the context of “Zemlia” almanacs. Information on censorship revisions and payment considerations (gradual reduction of fees) appears to be definitely interesting from the perspective of the history of literature. © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences-A.M.

"Empathic responding matters in face-to-face medical consultations. We have previously shown that patients' perceptions of doctor empathy also support positive experiences at an online clinic. However, there is still little knowledge about what types of communication influence patients’ online experiences of empathy. In this study we investigated text-based patient-doctor discourse at an online clinic using an adaptation of the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Our aims were 1) to assess the reliability of the adapted RIAS 2) to investigate what characteristics are common during the text-based consultations and 3) to examine how the doctor’s discourse relates to the patients’ experience of empathy online. Based on the inter-rater reliability analyses the conversational clusters of Social (ρ = 0.950), Biomedical (ρ = 0.939), and Technology related talk (ρ = 0.833), Procedural statements (ρ = 0.693) and Agreement (ρ = 0.687) were rated with acceptable reliability. Biomedical topics were most common in both patients’ and doctors’ communication. Patients’ experience of doctors’ empathy was positively correlated with the amount of doctor’s psychosocial talk and procedural statements although the effect sizes were small (ρ < 0.30 for all models). These results encourage the use of personal talk and giving clear instructions to patients about the care process at a text-based online clinic focusing on brief consultations. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The study is devoted to a novel method for a real-time prediction of significant discontinuities in social states using the automatic analyses of Arabic dailies’ overall logical structures. The paper introduces the novel, named the super-frequent N-gram approach and the Regression Mean Rank Dependency characteristic and presents their arrangement with a new model. It makes it possible to reliably forecast social changes based on the dailies’ semantic content’s high-level repercussions. An evaluation of the approach in a prominent Arabic daily demonstrates its ability to reflect changes in the social state and expose significant events of the “Arab Spring”. The study shows that the resulting N-gram models corresponding to different sizes of N can provide a more vital prediction tool so that the methodology can consistently predict substantial changes in the social state in an online simulation fashion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This chapter discusses sentiment analysis of meme-texts. Sentiment analysis of a text is general these days but meme-text is very rare. In this era of the Internet, we see many Internet memes on almost all social media platforms. These are unimodal content; we cannot ignore the multimodal content as for the last five years, memes have become a source for sharing information. In this paper, a memotion analysis task is performed, which is the sentiment analysis of memes organized by the SemEval-2020 Task 8 (Subtask a). Pretrained models BERT, Bi-LSTM, GRU, XLnet are used to model the meme-text, and also a simple feed-forward CNN model is used. GloVe and fastText models are used as embeddings. The highest F1 score in this contest was 0.35 which is 63% more than the baseline score of 0.21. The Bi-LSTM model with fastText embeddings outperformed it with a score of 0.70 (macro F1-score). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"A common metric for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is Word Error Rate (WER) which solely takes into account discrepancies at the word-level. Although useful, WER is not guaranteed to correlate well with human judgment or performance on downstream tasks that use ASR. Meaningful assessment of ASR mistakes becomes even more important in high-stake scenarios such as healthcare. We propose 2 general measures to evaluate the severity of mistakes made by ASR systems, one based on sentiment analysis and another based on text embeddings. We evaluate these measures on simulated patient-doctor conversations using 5 ASR systems. Results show that these measures capture characteristics of ASR errors that WER does not. Furthermore, we train an ASR system incorporating severity and demonstrate the potential for using severity not only in the evaluation, but in the development of ASR. Advantages and limitations of this methodology are analyzed and discussed. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This article discusses the formidable challenges that the advent of big data brings to the digital humanities broadly and proposes some ways the Korean studies community can prepare to navigate these uncharted waters. Standard digital humanities training in data mining, text analysis, mapping, network science, and machine learning will be developed and refined over the coming years, as will research concerning the ephemeral nature of new media, web archives, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. Yet I contend that established responses to the digital transformation of the humanities, while timely and necessary, will prove inadequate for handling petabyte- and exabyte-scale born-digital sources. In the Zettabyte Era, more data is processed in real time than all of the records produced from early times to the 2010s. To make sense of the current information regime, we need critical reflections and comparisons to the classical internet age of the 1990s, the personal computer revolution of the 1980s, and early modern print cultures. This exercise will allow us to situate the humanities in an age of big data as an extension of traditional humanities research and at the same as something foreign.

"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), is a method of sentiment analysis that focuses on identifying aspects/features in text and classifying their sentiment. Recently, many deep learning-based methods have achieved some success. However, they often focus solely on the relationship between aspect entities and sentiment words, overlooking the inherent fuzziness and dynamics of natural language. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that calculates semantic relevance weight based on dynamic noise, and combine it with an attention network to form our model (DNRA). Experimental results on restaurants dataset show that by our approach, accuracy is improved by 0.70%, reaching 83.83% compared to the baseline model. Meanwhile, we obtained the highest F1 scores compared to the baseline models on three datasets: laptops, restaurants, and Twitter, achieving scores of 73.33%, 76.59%, and 75.22%, respectively. In addition, we conducted a series of experiments to explore how different levels of noise affect performance on various datasets.  © 2023 IEEE."

"Unsupervised text style transfer (TST) is an important task with extensive implications in natural language generation (NLG). A prevalent approach involves editing the latent representations of text, guided by gradients from an attribute classifier. However, in multi-attribute TST, the simultaneous satisfaction of all required attributes remains challenging. In this paper, we unveil that the gradient direction during editing might conflict with certain attribute representations through empirical analysis. To tackle this problem, we introduce a mathematical programming method to impose constraints on the editing direction of multiple attributes, effectively mitigating potential attribute conflicts during the inference stage. Our proposed method considers the potential conflict between different attributes for the first time. Experimental results from the YELP benchmark showcase that our method can effectively improve the multi-attribute-transfer accuracy and quality without compromising single attribute performance. Moreover, our method can be readily integrated with pre-trained auto-encoders, providing an effective and scalable solution for multi-attribute scenarios. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"People are becoming more and more engaged with digital touchpoints and social platforms as a result of technological advancements. Each interaction is generating a lot of data in form of text, images, audio files, and videos. However, the most comprehensive form of user-generated data is still text. One of the text mining applications that is gaining prominence is sentiment analysis. By analysing the tone of online product reviews, any business can learn more about the opinions and thoughts of its customers. To learn more about the ideas and sentiments of customers, a variety of unique approaches and procedures are applied. Deep Learning models have been developed by numerous researchers in the past and many of the research did focus on standalone models like CNN and LSTM. In this article, we suggest a method to further increase the classification's overall accuracy by combining deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). The CNN, SVM, 1DCNN, and LSTM networks were used to analyse the sentiments in this study. The dataset comes from Kaggle and is called Amazon Product Review Dataset.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Assessments of digital maker activities increasingly rely on automatically analyzing student-created products and their components, such as their textual output. In particular, recent learning analytics research has proposed incorporating text analytic feedback for facilitating students' virtual reality (VR) content creation, though lacking direct empirical evidence from student-created artefacts. Thus, this study examined the relationships between metrics on text in student-created VR content and their learning performance. VR narration scripts and performance scores were collected from 102 students in a maker-based general education course. Results of statistical testing and text mining show that high and low-performing students demonstrated significant differences in such metrics as word counts, vocabulary sizes, and frequent unigrams and bigrams. This study makes methodological and practical contributions in the domains of maker education and learning analytics.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) aims to recover high-frequency details of an image from its low-resolution form. It is a highly challenging problem since low-resolution image is blur and contains noise. The application of SISR can be found in various fields, such as microscopic image analysis, medical imaging, security and surveillance imaging, biometric image identification, hyper spectral imaging and text image super-resolution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely used technique for SISR. Most of the previous CNN-based SISR methods blindly increase the network depth to achieve good performance, leading to increased computational cost. They train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and ground-truth images. U-SRN model is proposed for single-image super-resolution, consisting of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. Per-pixel loss is replaced with perceptual loss, which gives visually pleasing results. Extensive experiments show that the U-SRN model performs excellently and can perform multi-scale tasks. The model is trained on the DIV2K dataset. It is a benchmark dataset in the field of super-resolution, which consists of 1,000 high-quality images. Set 5, Set 14, Urban 100, and BSD 100 are the benchmark super-resolution datasets used for testing. For the upscaling factor of 4, the average gains on PSNR, SSIM and IFC achieved by U-SRN using Urban 100 dataset are 0.24 dB, 0.0037 and 0.025 higher than the next best approach. The results indicate that U-SRN performs better as compared to other state-of-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and IFC on all datasets. The other performance analysis criterion, such as PI (4.12), FSIM (0.971), and SRQC (0.954), indicate the superiority of the model. The network has limited number of parameters and performs fast execution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Study skills are considered critical in both the academic and professional life of a student. This study focusses on the extent to which secondary school students in Omani public schools possess study skills and how these are integrated into their English language textbook. The study explored i) the study skills profile of students in terms of college readiness, ii) the correlation between students' academic performance and study skills, and iii) the types of study skills embedded in the ‘Engage with English’ coursebook and workbook used in Grade 12. For this purpose, an adapted version of the pre-tested Study Skills Inventory developed by Dennis Congo was administered to 162 secondary school students. The results revealed that the students are relatively strong in the skills of memorising, test preparation, and concentration; however, most students lack fundamental study skills such as reading, critical and creative thinking, and time management skills. With respect to the correlation between study skills and academic performance, a bivariate correlation between the individual high school percentage and skills was performed using SPSS. The results showed a weak correlation between study skills and student performance for most of the skills except concentration which revealed a strong positive correlation with a Pearson value of 0.72. The document analysis of the textbook was conducted in alignment with the same inventory. The analysis revealed that although the textbook covers reading and memorising skills, other important skills including note-taking, test preparation, time management, and critical thinking skills are not targeted adequately. Although the student sample size is not large enough to generalise the findings of the study and only one textbook used by Grade 12 students was analysed, the authors conclude that there is an urgent need for the inclusion of study skills in the Omani public school curriculum to enhance students’ transition to higher education and subsequently, their professional success. The curriculum designers and decision-makers should consider embedding study skills more extensively in the curriculum during the next review cycle. © 2023 by University of Niš, Serbia | Creative Commons License: CC BY-NC-ND."
"Multilingual sentiment analysis refers to the process of sentiment scoring while gathering insights from data in different languages. Many research studies have been conducted to perform multilingual sentiment analysis. However, most of these studies focus on the short-distance semantics which consists in modeling local consecutive word sequences. In this work, we consider the global word co-occurrence in the whole corpus, which capture both short- and long-distance semantics, to convey more meaningful insights for the analysis. We propose an approach called MSA-GCN (Multilingual Sentiment Analysis based on Graph Convolutional Network) while supporting both short- and long-distance semantics. We build a single heterogeneous text graph for a multilingual corpus based on sequential, semantic, and statistical information. Then, a slightly deep graph convolutional network learns embeddings for all nodes in a semi-supervised manner. Extensive experiments are carried out on various datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Through their work, the author examines some of the problems of studying sources while researching the biography of famous Russian statesman V.N. Khitrovo (1834–1903), who played an important role in shaping the Middle East foreign policy of the Russian Empire. While in the region, he made a great contribution to the protection of Orthodoxy and Orthodox pilgrims in the Holy Land, including the development of education of the Arab population of Palestine and Syria, and promoting the spread of Orthodox education. In order to reconstruct the biography of V.N. Khitrovo, sources of various nature and origin were identified and classified. There has been conducted for the first-time analysis of materials from the private collection of V.N. Khitrovo stored in the Department of Manu-scripts of the Russian State Library; on their basis, the role of V.N. Khitrovo as a specialist in the field of genealogy is revealed within the text. The materials on the history of the Khitrovo family collected by him make it possible to most fully present the history of the family and its role in the development of the future statesman and organizer of science. There was used a wide range of unpublished archival documents containing material important for the reconstruction of V.N. Khitrovo’s biography. Above all, it is the correspondence of widow S.D. Khitrovo with bibliographer and literary critic S.I. Ponomarev. In addition, for the first time, the authors have collected obituary materials, a large amount of reference literature published in Russia in the second half of the XIX – early XX centuries, published official sources and documents of private origin, which have allow the researchers to begin supplementing, clarifying and correcting the information and facts from V.N.

"Medical visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering clinical questions of a given medical image, by taking consider of both visual and language information. However, due to the small scale of training data for medical VQA, pre-training fine-tuning paradigms have been a commonly used solution to improve model generalization performance. In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised approach that learns unimodal and multimodal feature representations of input images and text using medical image caption datasets, by leveraging both unimodal and multimodal contrastive losses, along with masked language modeling and image text matching as pre-training objectives. The pre-trained model is then transferred to downstream medical VQA tasks. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three publicly available medical VQA datasets with significant accuracy improvements of 2.2%, 14.7%, and 1.7% respectively. Besides, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to validate the effectiveness of different components of the approach and study different pre-training settings.

"Background: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have heightened the interest of the medical community in its application to health care in general, in particular to stroke, a medical emergency of great impact. In this rapidly evolving context, it is necessary to learn and understand the experience already accumulated by the medical and scientific community. Objective: The aim of this scoping review was to explore the studies conducted in the last 10 years using NLP to assist the management of stroke emergencies so as to gain insight on the state of the art, its main contexts of application, and the software tools that are used. Methods: Data were extracted from Scopus and Medline through PubMed, using the keywords “natural language processing” and “stroke.” Primary research questions were related to the phases, contexts, and types of textual data used in the studies. Secondary research questions were related to the numerical and statistical methods and the software used to process the data. The extracted data were structured in tables and their relative frequencies were calculated. The relationships between categories were analyzed through multiple correspondence analysis. Results: Twenty-nine papers were included in the review, with the majority being cohort studies of ischemic stroke published in the last 2 years. The majority of papers focused on the use of NLP to assist in the diagnostic phase, followed by the outcome prognosis, using text data from diagnostic reports and in many cases annotations on medical images. The most frequent approach was based on general machine learning techniques applied to the results of relatively simple NLP methods with the support of ontologies and standard vocabularies. Although smaller in number, there has been an increasing body of studies using deep learning techniques on numerical and vectorized representations of the texts obtained with more sophisticated NLP tools. Conclusions: Studies focused on NLP applied to stroke show specific trends that can be compared to the more general application of artificial intelligence to stroke. The purpose of using NLP is often to improve processes in a clinical context rather than to assist in the rehabilitation process. The state of the art in NLP is represented by deep learning architectures, among which Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers has been found to be especially widely used in the medical field in general, and for stroke in particular, with an increasing focus on the processing of annotations on medical images. ©Helios De Rosario, Salvador Pitarch-Corresa, Ignacio Pedrosa, Marina Vidal-Pedrós, Beatriz de Otto-López, Helena García-Mieres, Lydia Álvarez-Rodríguez.

"The article provides vast consideration over the nature phenomenon as psychostructutal component of the implied information included in the fictional text. It is proved that the nature is element of the valuable esthetic system of the accentuated linguistic personality. By linguopsychoaccentuation of the fragments of the fictional text containing nature description in the novella by Mykhailo Kotsyubynsky Intermezzo the above text is categorized as «light» type of the text (theory by Vareliy Belianyn). It is established that Kotsyubynsky is endowed by paranoid accentuation. That is why he longed for multifaceted presentation of nature images. It is found out that «light» emotional semantic dominant of the analyzed novella was being molded by high frequency lexics used for definition of the «light» verbalization of the polyfunctionality of the image of sun, bright coloured nature and for creating general positive narration. The analysis of many text missives made it possible to characterize the writer’s artistic applied for verbalization of the living nature with help of figurative associations, expressive connotation, unconventional tropes, universe spirituality done in compliance with the writer physiophilosophy. The nature in the novella is becoming alive and personificated, permeates the consciousness of the narrator triggering his internal imputes. Thus, the conclusion made about determinism of the fictional language of any text predetermined by the psychological characteristics of the classical writer. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Avoiding moral hazard is a recurrent argument of those seeking to limit the development of European financial support mechanisms. Germany has been the traditional leader of this coalition of actors in the European Union (EU). However, in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, Germany supported an EU response which included grants and massive debt issuance. What was previously presented as unacceptable–because of moral hazard–became appropriate. This contribution seeks to explain why the German government ceased to emphasise the moral hazard problem in EU economic governance. We argue that the answer is not because of a challenge to the relevance of moral hazard per se, or because the Germans lost interest in the moral hazard problem, but rather because German policymakers were discursively constrained by one of the dominant meanings of moral hazard they had previously imposed–which lost its relevance in the context of a symmetric exogenous shock. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The International Civic and Citizenship Education from IEA (CIVED/ICCS) is part of the regular list of international tests applied in Chile for the creation of education policies in the area. Nevertheless, the specific connections that this study has acquired in the education policy are essentially unknown, creating a pending intellectual debt in the local research field. The goal of this study is to specify and critically comprehend the link established by the local agents along with the citizenship agenda promoted by CIVED/ICCS in the policy for citizen education in Chile between the years 1999 and 2016. This proposal assumed an interpretive paradigm and a documentary-type research design, in which critical discourse analysis tools were applied. It was concluded that the uses and references of CIVEN/ICCS text follow a relevant thematic selection and political legitimation framed by the context of educational and social change. © (2023) All Rights Reserved."
"Natural Language Processing is the ability of a system to understand, interpret, and analyze spoken words, text files, etc. There have been plethora of models that have been developed for language processing which consist of rule-based approach, Neural Network approach, and Traditional Machine Learning. NLP has a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and intelligent personal assistants. In recent years, NLP has made significant progress, thanks to the development of deep learning models, which have greatly improved the performance of NLP systems. To make the machine understand the speech, the machine should be able to understand the sentences, which can only be achieved when the sentences are well-structured, which is ensured by Grammar. In this paper, a survey is done on various natural language processing works that have been done for the Nepali language, different resources, and work available. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"A rise in the circulation of memes has led to the spread of a new form of multimodal hateful content. Unfortunately, the degree of hate women receive on the internet is disproportionately skewed against them. This, combined with the fact that multimodal misogyny is more challenging to detect as opposed to traditional text-based misogyny, signifies that the task of identifying misogynistic memes online is one of utmost importance. To this end, the MAMI dataset was released, consisting of 12000 memes annotated for misogyny and four sub-classes of misogyny - shame, objectification, violence and stereotype. While this balanced dataset is widely cited, we find that the task itself remains largely unsolved. Thus, in our work, we1 investigate the performance of multiple models in an effort to analyse whether domain specific pretraining helps model performance. We also investigate why even state of the art models find this task so challenging, and whether domain-specific pretraining can help. Our results show that pretraining BERT on hateful memes and leveraging an attention-based approach with ViT outperforms state of the art models by more than 10%. Further, we provide insight into why these models may be struggling with this task with an extensive qualitative analysis of random samples from the test set. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This document makes a presentation of what the abuse of the dominant position implies for the antitrust right, and how companies that have this position in a market, with the help of Big Data, can establish behaviors of fixing of perfect prices or in the first degree and how this conduct can injure competition and affect consumers and finally know if the Colombian standard is prepared to face these situations. To this end, the text starts with a description of what price fixing and discrimination means in the economic and legal literature; then what does the dominant position mean and how the competition authorities manage to determine if a company has this position and an analysis of the Colombian norm and the decisions issued by the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce in the matter of discrimination abuses, so that can conclude which is the approach with which the authority has resolved these types of cases. © 2023, Corporacion Universitaria Republicana.

"Multi-modal aspect-based sentiment classification (MABSC) is an approach aimed at classifying the sentiment of a target entity mentioned in a sentence using images. However, previous methods failed to account for the fine-grained semantic association between the image and the text, which resulted in limited identification of fine-grained image aspects and opinions. To address these limitations, a new approach called SeqCSG has been proposed in this paper. SeqCSG enhances the encoder-decoder sentiment classification framework using sequential cross-modal semantic graphs. SeqCSG utilizes image captions and scene graphs to extract both global and local fine-grained image information and considers them as elements of the cross-modal semantic graph along with tokens from tweets. The sequential cross-modal semantic graph is represented as a sequence with a multi-modal adjacency matrix indicating relationships between elements. Experimental results have shown that the approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard datasets. Further analysis has demonstrated that the model can implicitly learn the correlation between fine-grained information of the image and the text with the given target. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"P-TECH is a pioneering education reform initiative to prepare young people with the academic, technical, and professional skills required for 21st-century jobs and ongoing education. Mentoring is one of the key activities of P-TECH for students to think about their pathways and build engineering attitudes. After each mentoring session, we take surveys to evaluate how the sessions affected the students and we achieved our objectives. In addition to conventional method, we executed systematic analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions using text mining technology. The subjects of this paper were 30 high school sophomores in 2019. We mentored them eight times in 2019 and 2020 and took surveys after each session. We gathered 1784 documents in total as the responses to open-ended questions and analyzed them with a text mining tool. The tool showed the top three frequent nouns were synonyms for “myself”, and the top three correlated nouns of “myself” were “future”, “thought”, and “way”. This indicates many students considered their pathways during the mentoring sessions and discussed them in their surveys. The tool also showed that the top correlated noun/verb phrases were “build… Plan”, “obtain… Advice”, and “have… Interest”. This indicates that students correctly received the messages intended by the mentoring. Our results showed that the mentoring activities helped students consider their future. Text mining was a useful technique to analyze answers to open-ended survey questions. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing."
"An inclusive society needs to facilitate access to information for all of its members, including citizens with low literacy and with non-native language skills. We present an approach to assess Dutch text complexity on the sentence level and conduct an interpretability analysis to explore the link between neural models and linguistic complexity features.1 Building on these findings, we develop the first contextual lexical simplification model for Dutch and publish a pilot dataset for evaluation. We go beyond previous work which primarily targeted lexical substitution and propose strategies for adjusting the model’s linguistic register to generate simpler candidates. Our results indicate that continual pre-training and multi-task learning with conceptually related tasks are promising directions for ensuring the simplicity of the generated substitutions. Our code repository and the simplification dataset are available on GitHub. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Coherence is a crucial aspect of evaluating text readability and can be assessed through two primary factors when evaluating an essay in a scoring scenario. The first factor is logical coherence, characterized by the appropriate use of discourse connectives and the establishment of logical relationships between sentences. The second factor is the appropriateness of punctuation, as inappropriate punctuation can lead to confused sentence structure. To address these concerns, we propose a coherence scoring model consisting of a regression model with two feature extractors: a local coherence discriminative model and a punctuation correction model. We employ gradient-boosting regression trees as the regression model and impose monotonicity constraints on the input features. The results show that our proposed model better generalizes unseen data. The model achieved third place in track 1 of NLPCC 2023 shared task 7. Additionally, we briefly introduce our solution for the remaining tracks, which achieves second place for track 2 and first place for both track 3 and track 4. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Aiming at the concept of MAV/UAV coordinated combat, this paper proposes the UAF architecture based on the capability-oriented approach and designs a typical combat scenario of MAV/UAV air-ground coordinated combat. According to the UAF methodology, the architecture analysis and design of MAV/UAV cooperative combat capabilities and tasks are completed from the Operational viewpoint and Resource viewpoint. Through the UAF model, the text document is transformed into an executable model to clearly express the combat concept. First, from the functional requirements of the Operational concept, The Operational High Level Concept diagram, Operational Internal connectivity diagram, and Operational Process Flow diagram under the Operational viewpoint are established. Then the functional nodes of the Operational viewpoint are corresponded to each system equipment in the combat system, and the timing relationship and information transfer between the combat activities and combat states of each combat equipment in the whole combat concept are analyzed. Based on the UAF description, the MAV/UAV combat coordinated conceptual model can provide a reference for subsequent combat conceptualization, combat effectiveness assessment and equipment development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Positive psychology (PP) interventions utilize short tasks (e.g., using personal strengths,) to cultivate well-being, and they may increase cardiac health behaviors. Text message interventions (TMIs) may represent a novel, accessible means to deliver a personalized, PP-based program to promote health behavior engagement. Accordingly, we developed Text4Health, a 12-week, adaptive, PP-based TMI, which delivers specific text messages to individuals in response to their ratings of prior messages, to promote health in persons at elevated cardiac risk. In this manuscript, we describe the design, conduct, and process-related results of a controlled pilot trial of the Text4Health program, compared to enhanced usual care, among 60 patients with multiple cardiac risk conditions and suboptimal adherence to diet and exercise. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adaptive TMI. As a key secondary analysis, we are comparing between-group differences in health-related outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks. Study procedures have been successfully completed for all 60 participants. Study participants reported the intervention as useful (mean rating 7.5 [SD 1.7] out of 10) and low burden (mean rating of burden 1.5/10 [SD 2.1]). In exit interviews, they reported enjoying the different types of text messages and provided suggestions for further intervention refinement. If subsequent analysis of the intervention shows potential benefit on clinically relevant outcomes, the next step will be to test it in a larger randomized trial powered to detect changes in health behaviors and other patient-centered outcomes.

"In this article, the authors consider the problem of text generation for low- resource languages, using the Kazakh language as an example, based on semantic analysis. Machine learning method is used in the generation of text documents and sources in the Kazakh language. First, semantic analysisis performed, the number of words in the given text, the number of stop words, the number of symbols, etc. Then the TF-IDF algorithm is used to find the semantically important words of the text. Annotation of the given text by means of semantic analysis. And at the end, generation of text with advanced semantic analysis. A corpus for the Kazakh language was prepared for experiments and research. GPT-3 and NLG are used in the process of generation. Generation by means of semantic analysis of the text gives us some great opportunities. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method is used during generation.Generation gives us a lot of opportunities, including not spending time on unnecessary information.

"The domain of summarization of multimedia is rapidly evolving and creating an impact in the present world in several verticals. An enormous amount of hardware resources are involved in the communication ecosystem. The scalable nature along with diversity and specificity is a major challenge in establishing effective summarization algorithms. The present algorithms are incapable of capturing semantic relationships among words as they focus majorly upon the extractive version of summarization. The analysis focuses entirely upon abstractive summarization of textual corpus. The system incorporates heuristic approaches to train the system and predict test data. The entire model is developed using state-of-the-art architectures by incorporating the Transformer model. The encoder and decoder schemes help in effective summaries as compared to the extractive approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"BACKGROUND: Sexual violence (SV) is a serious public health concern, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ+) youth report higher rates than their heterosexual and cisgender peers. This qualitative study aimed to understand LGBTQ+ students' perspectives on how middle and high school environments can better prevent and address SV. METHODS: In partnership with a school-based LGBTQ+ support group in Washington State, we recruited 31 LGTBQ+ students ages 13-18 for virtual interviews (n = 24) and for providing text-based answers to interview questions (n = 7). We used inductive thematic analysis to analyze data and identify themes. RESULTS: To prevent and respond to SV, students highlighted schools having: (1) access to gender-neutral spaces; (2) LGBTQ+ competency training for staff; (3) enforcement of school policies (eg, SV, anti-bullying) and accountability; (4) LGBTQ+-competent mental health support; and (5) comprehensive sexual health education that addresses LGBTQ+ relationships and SV. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY, PRACTICE, AND EQUITY: Students expressed the need for changes in school physical and social environments to address SV among LGBTQ+ youth. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating youth perspectives, particularly LGBTQ+ youth at high risk of SV, can help schools implement strategies that are supported by youth and thus potentially more sustainable and effective. © 2023, American School Health Association."
"The common law system is a legal system that values precedent, or previous court decisions, in the resolution of current cases. As the availability of legal documents in digital form has increased, it has become more difficult for legal professionals to manually identify relevant past cases due to the vast amount of data. Researchers have developed automated systems for determining the similarity between legal documents to address this issue. Our research explores various representations of a legal document and discusses a novel paragraph filtering process to identify key paragraphs using legal citation information to remove unnecessary text paragraphs without disturbing the concept of the legal document. State-of-the-art techniques like TF-IDF, BERT, Legal Bert, Doc2Vec, and Legal-longformer are used for the performance analysis of the proposed approach with document comparison. It has been shown that a model trained on the proposed filtered paragraphs can achieve better results than a model trained on the complete text and can also shorten the document by over 40%. The proposed filtering strategy could be helpful for models like BERT, where the maximum token length is fixed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"The article examines the problem of reminiscences from the works of the medieval Persian poet Saadi in the non-fiction texts of Ivan Bunin in the source studies aspect, using the principle of historicism and the method of comparative analysis. The objects of consideration were the letters and journalistic texts of the writer relating to 1910–1935, the subject was the images, sayings, maxims of Saadi reflected in them. The purpose of the study is to identify and analyze the sources of reminiscences from Saadi’s works, specifically their translated editions in Russian and the main European languages. The study found that, firstly, Bunin used as sources of Saadi’s texts not only the “classical” translations of books “Bustan” (1257) and “Gulistan” (1258), which appeared by the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th centuries, but also related to one degree or another scientific, popular science and fiction literature by the poet’s creative work. Secondly, in Bunin’s epistolary and journalism, borrowings from Saadi’s works were subjected to quite significant creative processing. © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences-A.M.

"In recent years, pre-trained language models have motivated the study in various tasks in natural language processing(NLP). In a new paradigm instead of fine-tuning, reformulating downstream tasks as cloze tasks by add textual or continuous prompts is a popular measure for solving NLP tasks. However, the effect of prompt learning tends to be only ensured by appropriate prompts and precise verbalizers. To address this issue, we propose a prompt matching method based on trigger tokens to solve emotional polar prediction tasks. The proposed model can extract the aspect words and key adjectives from input text as trigger tokens. Meanwhile, by introducing external knowledge we expand trigger tokens which are applicated in verbalizers and prompts matching. According to experiments, we show that providing instances which share the similar emotional trigger tokens improves model performance. And tests on the hotel reviews dataset show that our model have more high precision rate. In few-shot scenario, We also show that the fewer the samples, the more our model outperforms fine-tuning models. These results demonstrate that automatically providing instances with similar emotions is a new method to solve text classification tasks in few-shot scenario.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The claw crane—an arcade game that invites its players to remotely grab a prize with a “claw”—has undergone a long process of development from an eye-catching “steam shovel” to a calculated gambling machine across amusement arcades, train stations, and traveling carnivals. Recently, the claw crane has become a common transmedia object in various consumer outlets around the world, serving today’s “kidults” who are willing to play and be playful with toys as grownups. Especially in South Korea, the claw crane now rewards its players with cutified character plushies, which arguably reflects and resonates with the local sociocultural conventions. In this mixed-methods study, we deconstruct the claw crane as a historical artifact that promotes diverse forms of human interaction and engagement in the techno-cultural and social context of South Korea. The claw crane (or in South Korea, rather the “toy crane”) is investigated by means of historical design analysis, a review of contemporary South Korean media texts, and field observations in Seoul. We suggest the claw crane to serve as a multipurpose medium for playful interactions beyond the act of play itself—and in South Korea, having become a means for playful courting and emotional support, which at times of anxiety, stress, and uncertainty may contribute to one’s confidence and belief in the future.

"How does a reader give a text meaning? In what ways do we understand the operations of encounters between a text and a reader? Focusing on the materiality of reading, this study aims to understand how anonymous readers in late Chosŏn Korea read the poetry of Du Fu, a renowned literary canon from China. To identify the meaning of the texts as constituted by the readers, we look at both the texts and the readers’ practices by identifying the readers’ prior knowledge of the text that has been embedded and coded in their reading notes, and by analyzing the relationship between the notes and the main body of poetry. Through this analysis, this paper shows that the reading of texts was performed through constant interactions with interpretive traditions and cultural legacies. Through their practices of reading, consequently, they reveal which communities of interpretation they distinctively belong to. To identify the invisible patterns of the exegetical traditions in their reading practices, we particularly apply methods in digital humanities, such as citation network analysis, which is an effective tool to recognize the structure of relationships among the notes, poems, and many other factors of the texts.

"Crohn’s disease is a chronic, lifelong condition with increasing rates of morbidity. It can have a significant impact on one’s physical, emotional, economic and social functioning. Both medical as well as social fields of studies have adapted the construct of Quality of Life to assess the well being of patients. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of scientist’s research concerning Quality of Life in Crohn’s disease patients from an interdisciplinary, medical and psychological perspective exceeding beyond a single definition or a paradigm. EBSCOhost Research Databases platform was used to conduct the preliminary search. Then, a further qualitative analysis of texts was conducted. The results showed a declining interest in Quality of Life of Crohn’s disease patients in the studied 10-year scope on average by 11.49% from year to year. Also, an underrepresentation of studies of the nature of psychological variables in relation to studies of the medical description was found. An information gap in scientific cognition related to the interdisciplinary approach regarding the studied topic was recognized. There is a necessity to broaden the horizons of the conducted research to include further issues at several levels of inference. This approach would be needed not only in the dimension of scientific considerations, but also or above all in the practical dimension. © 2023 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved."
"Openness in education has received significant attention in recent years. To comprehend this concept in education ecosystems thoroughly, a longitudinal study is crucial, offering a comprehensive perspective of its evolution. The study utilizes bibliometric techniques, social network analysis, and text mining to investigate openness from its origin to the present day. The research highlights that the idea of openness, initially linked to open universities, has expanded into broader education ecosystems due to advancements in digital technologies, especially around the turn of the 21st century. Embracing open access and open scholarship as new business models is essential to consolidate openness in education. Additionally, distance education, online learning, and educational technology play vital roles as catalysts for openness in education, providing a holistic understanding of the concept. © 2023 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc."
"In this study, the successful implementation of an active learning algorithm on small-scale datasets is demonstrated. The study also examines the dynamics of public opinions on COVID-19 vaccinations using VK (social network) commentaries related to the COVID-19 vaccine and masks for opinion evaluation. The proposed methodology includes several stages such as natural language processing, classification with active learning, exploratory data analysis, and opinion dynamics. Natural language processing is used for text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction. A machine learning model with active learning is employed to identify opinions as positive, negative, or neutral/unknown. The model includes classical machine learning, machine learning and deep learning models. The results show that the highest classification accuracy is 69.1% and 73.1% without and with the active learning algorithm, respectively. The experimental results suggest that classifiers using active learning perform better than simple natural language processing classifiers on small-scale datasets. © 2023 ASSA."
"Fine-grained sentiment analysis of dialogue text is crucial for the model to understand the conversational participants’ viewpoints and provide accurate responses in generating replies. Unfortunately, in the field of conversational opinion mining, coarse-grained dialogue emotion analysis remains the mainstream approach, despite being unable to meet the actual needs in some specific scenarios such as customer service question and answer system. This work focuses on conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple analysis, which aims to detect the sentiment quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment in a dialogue. In this study, we mainly extract triplets and judge the unique sentiment, which is determined by the target and opinion terms together. For this purpose, we fine-tune the pre-trained language models using the DiaASQ dataset. We optimize the rotation positional information embedding by combining the actual length of the dialogue text and use adversarial training to enhance the model’s performance and robustness. Finally, We use beam search ensemble algorithm to improve the entire triplet extraction system’s performance. Our system achieved an average F1 score 40.50 that ranked second in the Chinese dataset and fifth in the general dataset for the Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Analysis shared task at NLPCC-2023. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Using some of the best-known examples from Croatian literature, this article examines the influence of censors on shaping the literary field in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century. It compares the role of educated censors who supported the development of the literary field in the first decades of nineteenth-century Habsburg Croatia with that of censors who implemented the regime’s strict guidelines in the 1840s by banning books that had already been published with permission of a censor. Both types of censorship gave rise to political resistance, either through political struggle and illegal publication, or by means of covert literary devices such as allegory or Aesopian literary strategies. Moreover, the article highlights the problems of deciphering political allegory in the literary history of small nations, which tend to orientalise their literary heritage. In contrast to these tendencies, a new interpretation of the canonical text of Croatian literature, Smrt Smail-age Čengića [The Death of Smail-Aga Čengić] by Ivan Mažuranić, is offered here, presenting it as an example of explicit political commentary and a hidden literary response to strict censorship. A comparative analysis of his literary and political writings reveals their great importance both for the history of the Habsburg monarchy in the nineteenth century and for today’s Europe built upon the vision of unity within diversity. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."
"Automated text-to-image (image synthesis) and image-to-text (image captioning) generation are two of the most challenging and cutting-edge fields of study in Computer Vision (CV) in conjunction with Natural Language Processing (NLP). The image-to-text synthesis, also known as Image Captioning (IC), has numerous applications in visual assistance, machine vision, remote security, healthcare, and remote sensing, among others. Since their origin, the IC frameworks have been constructed utilizing a two-subcomponent pipeline consisting of the visual feature extraction and natural language modeling subcomponents. The recent surge of interest in the applications of sequential deep learning models in machine translation has resulted in the development of efficient language modeling architectures. Deep sequential modeling architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), tackle the intricacies of the multi-modular space far better than existing machine learning-based translation approaches. The tremendous growth of deep language modeling architectures in IC necessitates a comprehensive review of its literature. In this survey, we conduct an exhaustive and analytical analysis of the language modeling architectures used in IC frameworks for caption generation, along with their training corpus datasets. We also identify a list of open research issues and potential research areas for future work. © 2023 IEEE."
"The article is devoted to the study of the Karelian runosongs of the bilingual storyteller of the White Sea, Matvey Korguev. The tasks of the study include the identification of runosongs recorded from Korguev in archival and published sources; determination of their genre affiliation, range of plots and motifs; analysis of their features in the context of the Karelian epic tradition. The texts of 29 runosongs containing the plot “Searching for a tree for a boat” and 271 runes with the plot “Feast in Päivölä” from published collections and the Scientific Manuscript Archive of the Karelian Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences were used for comparison. It has been established that three runosongs were written down from M. Korguev, one of which (a handwritten version of 1938) is introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. According to a comparative textual analysis, the records of 1938 and 1941 are variants of the epic runosong with contamination of the plots “Search for a tree for a boat” and “Feast in Päivölä,” while the text of 1935 contains only the plot “Feast in Päivölä.” All texts have an original composition, complicated by interspersing motifs from the plots “Competition in matchmaking” and “Journey to Pohjola.” The text of 1935 contains the motif of the birth of the sun from the yolk, which belongs to the plot “Creation of the World.” Most of the identified motifs are traditional for Karelian epic poetry. Unique are the motifs for setting off to marry on an ahkivo and the marriage of an uninvited guest who killed the host of the feast, as well as some details of the narrative. © 2023 Russian Academy of Sciences-A.M.

"Background: SMS text messages are affordable, scalable, and effective smoking cessation interventions. However, there is little research on SMS text message interventions specifically designed to support people who smoke to quit by switching to vaping. Objective: Over 3 phases, with vapers and smokers, we codeveloped and coproduced a mobile phone SMS text message program. The coproduction paradigm allowed us to collaborate with researchers and the community to develop a more relevant, acceptable, and equitable SMS text message program. Methods: In phase 1, we engaged people who vape via Twitter and received 167 responses to our request to write SMS text messages for people who wish to quit smoking by switching to vaping. We screened, adjusted, refined, and themed the messages, resulting in a set of 95 that were mapped against the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation–Behavior constructs. In phase 2, we evaluated the 95 messages from phase 1 via a web survey where participants (66/202, 32.7% woman) rated up to 20 messages on 7-point Likert scales on 9 constructs: being understandable, clear, believable, helpful, interesting, inoffensive, positive, and enthusiastic and how happy they would be to receive the messages. In phase 3, we implemented the final set of SMS text messages as part of a larger randomized optimization trial, in which 603 participants (mean age 38.33, SD 12.88 years; n=369, 61.2% woman) received SMS text message support and then rated their usefulness and frequency and provided free-text comments at the 12-week follow-up. Results: For phase 2, means and SDs were calculated for each message across the 9 constructs. Those with means below the neutral anchor of 4 or with unfavorable comments were discussed with vapers and further refined or removed. This resulted in a final set of 78 that were mapped against early, mid-, or late stages of quitting to create an order for the messages. For phase 3, a total of 38.5% (232/603) of the participants provided ratings at the 12-week follow-up. In total, 69.8% (162/232) reported that the SMS text messages had been useful, and a significant association between quit rates and usefulness ratings was found (χ21=9.6; P=.002). A content analysis of free-text comments revealed that the 2 most common positive themes were helpful (13/47, 28%) and encouraging (6/47, 13%) and the 2 most common negative themes were too frequent (9/47, 19%) and annoying (4/47, 9%). Conclusions: In this paper, we describe the initial coproduction and codevelopment of a set of SMS text messages to help smokers stop smoking by transitioning to vaping. We encourage researchers to use, further develop, and evaluate the set of SMS text messages and adapt it to target populations and relevant contexts. ©Vassilis Sideropoulos, Eleni Vangeli, Felix Naughton, Sharon Cox, Daniel Frings, Caitlin Notley, Jamie Brown, Catherine Kimber, Lynne Dawkins."

"The advent of the digital era has seen the rise of social media as an alternative mode of communication. The usage of social media platforms for facilitating contact between individuals has become widespread. As a direct result of this, conventional modes of communication have been replaced by digital modes, thanks to social media. Because of the growing prevalence of cyberbullying, this digital development on social media platforms is a significant problem that must be addressed. Bullies have various options to harass and threaten individuals in their communities because of the platforms that are already available. It has been argued that a number of different tactics and approaches may be employed to combat cyberbullying via the use of early identification and alerts to locate and/or protect victims of cyberbullying. Methods from the field of machine learning (ML) have seen widespread use in the search for language patterns used by bullies to cause damage to their victims. This research paper analyzes standard supervised learning and ensemble machine learning algorithms. The ensemble technique utilizes random forest (RF) and AdaBoost classifiers, whereas the supervised method uses Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNV), logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT). We use the dataset to train and evaluate our binary classification model to classify abusive language as bullying or non-bullying and extract Twitter features using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. This paper analyzes each machine learning algorithm. Ensemble-supervised algorithms outperformed standard supervised algorithms in the analysis. With a dataset, the random forest classifier performed best with 92% accuracy, while the Naive Bayes classifier performed worst with 62% accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Sentiment analysis is a crucial text classification task that aims to extract, process, and analyze opinions, sentiments, and subjectivity within texts. In current research on Chinese text, sentence and aspect-based sentiment analysis is mainly tackled through well-designed models. However, despite the importance of word order and function words as essential means of semantic expression in Chinese, they are often underutilized. This paper presents a new Chinese sentiment analysis method that utilizes a Learnable Conjunctions Enhanced Model (LCEM). The LCEM adjusts the general structure of the pre-trained language model and incorporates conjunctions location information into the model’s fine-tuning process. Additionally, we discuss a variant structure of residual connections to construct a residual structure that can learn critical information in the text and optimize it during training. We perform experiments on the public datasets and demonstrate that our approach enhances performance on both sentence and aspect-based sentiment analysis datasets compared to the baseline pre-trained language models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"This paper conducts a content safety analysis based on a multimodal dataset of COVID-19-related social media samples. A joint model of multimodal images and long texts is employed to perform an in-depth analysis of sample content. Relevant text, images, and other materials related to the pandemic topics on social platforms are collected to create a multimodal dataset of social media discourse on the pandemic. Traditional machine learning algorithms are used for in-depth data processing and topic analysis of the multimodal dataset, studying the topics people are concerned about, the main methods and ways of inappropriate discourse. Based on these results, discourses that lead to social insecurity are categorized into several categories. With this categorization, the dataset is labeled, and a multimodal deep learning model is designed. The model is used to conduct deep learning on the generated multimodal dataset, extracting their respective features, conducting feature fusion, and classifying the samples in the dataset. The discourses are divided into two major categories and several subcategories. Based on this, we propose the COVID-19 Content Safety Detection Algorithm (CSDMC, Content security detection algorithm of COVID-19 epidemic based on multimodal strong robustness). When compared with other algorithms in the experimental comparison, it achieves a relatively high accuracy rate. The experiment proves that this algorithm can effectively extract multimodal features and achieve a higher accuracy rate.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Software modification impact analysis could be a methodology for decisive in measuring the impacts of a change or estimating what has to be modified to work with the upcoming changes. This paper work is typically used in the maintenance phase since software programs must be adjusted to meet the needs of users or clients. This paper aims to evaluate the Java and Python applications using change impact analysis. The proposed approach helps developers to determine which parts of a Java/Python application is affected by specified change given as an input which is either class/variable/method name as change with 95–96% accuracy in the Python environment tested in visual studio code. The developed tool name is Anpert. It also displays the before and after change, the type of change whether it is variable change or method name change or class name change along with true positives, true negatives, false positives for specified change for a given Java or Python application, and it also determines how long it took to analyze the impact (i.e., impacted percentage for a given change for tested application) and time taken for change impact analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"One of the central tasks of medical text analysis is to extract and structure meaningful information from plain-text clinical documents. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction that involves identifying predefined entities from unstructured free text. Notably, NER models require large amounts of human-labeled data to train, but human annotation is costly and laborious and often requires medical training. Here, we aim to overcome the shortage of manually annotated data by introducing a training scheme for NER models that uses an existing medical ontology to assign weak labels to entities and provides enhanced domain-specific model adaptation with in-domain continual pretraining. Due to limited human annotation resources, we develop a specific module to collect a more representative test dataset from the data lake than a random selection. To validate our framework, we invite clinicians to annotate the test set. In this way, we construct two Finnish medical NER datasets based on clinical records retrieved from a hospital’s data lake and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

"Detection and language identification of texts in an unconstrained scene image are quintessential processes in the multimedia information retrieval domain. Over the years, various approaches have investigated them by considering detection and language identification as separate problem statements. To the best of our knowledge, scene text datasets with minority Indic languages are not yet available. To this end, we created a scene image dataset called EMBiL containing a combination of English and Manipuri text. It contains 720 scene images with a total of over 28500 text instances. The Manipuri language is one of the official languages of India. To benchmark the performance of EMBiL, we proposed a single-stage simultaneous detection and language identification network called SceneTextYOLO-Net based on YOLOv5. We specifically included the shallow layer characteristics and applied a multi-scale detection head to improve small target text detection. We also inserted an attention mechanism between the neck and head structures to concentrate on the image’s essential regions. We performed extensive experiments on the proposed dataset using various state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, we performed experimental analysis on ICDAR2015 using SceneTextYOLO-Net and state-of-the-art methods.

"The accurate prediction of lexical relations between words is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The most recent advances in this direction come with the use of pre-trained language models (PTLMs). A PTLM typically needs “well-formed"" verbalized text to interact with it, either to fine-tune it or to exploit it. However, there are indications that commonly used PTLMs already encode enough linguistic knowledge to allow the use of minimal (or none) textual context for some linguistically motivated tasks, thus notably reducing human effort, the need for data pre-processing, and favoring techniques that are language neutral since do not rely on syntactic structures. In this work, we explore this idea for the tasks of lexical relation classification (LRC) and graded Lexical Entailment (LE). After finetuning PTLMs for LRC with different verbalizations, our evaluation results show that very simple prompts are competitive for LRC and significantly outperform graded LE SoTA. In order to gain a better insight into this phenomenon, we perform a number of quantitative statistical analyses on the results, as well as a qualitative visual exploration based on embedding projections. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The article presents modelling of spherical elements based on the developed computer model. We recorded the main combinations of spherical particles during filling, which are formed in the hopper. It was found that the most likely combination that occurs when modelling spherical elements consists of three balls. It should be noted that in the cross-section of such a combination passing through the center of the balls, an equilateral triangle is formed. And in the cross-section of the structure, which consists of four spherical balls, a rhombus is formed, if you connect the centers of these spherical elements. It is worth noting that from this formed combination of spherical elements, it can be seen that the rhombus forms two smaller equilateral triangles that fix the process of pushing the spherical balls apart. In turn, the process of pushing spherical elements apart made it possible to fix the contact between spherical elements, as well as to state the stable position of each (individual) particle. This paper also presents the main fragments of encoding the source text of a 3D computer model for modelling spherical elements, which made it possible to optimize the model parameters. It was found that from the obtained data on the distribution of coordination numbers for different volume fillings of spherical elements, it follows that the largest filling was 72 %, which corresponds to the state when 112 lobules have an average coordination number of 3.92. © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."
"More than one language is supported by NLP; with sophisticated models like BERT trained in advance on enormous, unlabeled text corpora, deep learning has transformed NLP. Better performance can be achieved when more data is not available by using transfer learning. Concentrating on low and medium-source languages as the majority of the research is based on English. Wikipedia data was trained in 104 languages to replace the single language BERT with multilingual BERT.

"In this modern world, product reviews on online shopping sites are become an essential resource to help the customers make better decisions about purchasing products and achieve good sales for the products. Customers share their opinion about a recently purchased product on online shopping sites, it is important to find a smart system to detect emotions from customer reviews. Aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine consumers' opinions on various aspects of services. For starters, the text cleaning is done for preparing raw text for NLP so that machine can understand the human language. The following preprocessing will be done to prepare the text for classification. Then Tokenization takes place, after that Stop words will be removed to improve the performance of the model, then lemmatization takes place. Then, Fast text will be deployed to achieve scalable solutions for text classification tasks. Then we get similar words with underlying sentiments. Then train the model with the folds and finally we test the model. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023."
"As a subtask of text classification, sentiment classification is a domain of study that advances rapidly with applications in almost any field in our daily life. Although many models have performed well on multiple binary sentiment classification datasets, there is still much space for improvement in the process of fine-grained sentiment analysis, which is essential for understanding people's perceptions of all kinds of topics, services, and products. In this paper, both the pre-training language model BERT whose initial parameters were fine-tuned for this task, and the RoBERTa model that improved the original way of pre-training were applied to the fine-grained sentiment analysis problem on the benchmark of the SST-5 dataset. Over the experiments, it is found that the RoBERTa model achieves higher accuracy compared with the fine-tuned BERT, which indicates that an improved way of pre-training can be more effective than just fine-tuning the initially learned parameters for the BERT model in this sentiment analysis task.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The study and interpretation of the media discourse devoted to the family as a universal human value are urgent tasks of modern linguistics. The object of the research presented in the article is the economic discourse about the family of modern Russian, Vietnamese and Danish popular social-and-political national publications, and the purpose is to describe the linguistic and cultural characteristics of this discourse by identifying its value – semantic content expressed in the peculiarities of the actualization of the image of the family. Using the methods of content analysis, comparison of dictionary definitions of the words semya, gia dinh, familie and their distributive analysis, the features of the image of the family in the economic discourse of Russian and foreign media were found. In the Russian media, the image of a family is actualized by lexical means, which indicate the presence of children in it, its need for material support and social protection, the need to protect traditional family values, units that actualize the image of a large family. In the Vietnamese media, the image of the family is formed by lexical means, which characterize the problems of financial distress of families, determining the family’s belonging to the working class, actualizing the importance of family support by its members and their responsibility for its well-being. In the Danish media, the image of the family is formed by lexical means, which indicate the presence of a family business, characterizing the financial well-being of families, actualizing the image of the royal family. © 2023, Volgograd State University.

"Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications. Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world's languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) use novel teaching approaches and attracted wide variety of learners via the web in recent days. As MOOCs have evolved rapidly, identifying the best MOOC for a particular domain or subject is very challenging task. Sentiment analysis is the best approach to evaluate. MOOCs using text reviews. Sentiment analysis aims to identify and extract subjective information or opinion of the public on a particular service or product using text reviews. Extracting sentiment out of a text segment is significantly a challenging task. Recent developments in deep learning have evidently shown a great success in the field of Natural Language Understanding and especially in sentiment analysis. In Most of the NLP tasks, Current state-of-the-art results are achieved through Pretrained models like BERT and XLNet build on top of deep learning architecture using Transfer Learning. The aim of this chapter is to explore the sentiment of the students through sentiment analysis using forum posts. We proposed a fine-tuned XLNet model to perform sentiment analysis, fine-tuned the proposed model using optimal hyper parameters and trained on MOOCs forum posts Dataset and IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset. Experimental results shown that our pretrained XLNet model out perform the other deep learning and pretrained models for sentiment analysis task. As the proposed model is working well with IMDB dataset, we can say that the model is domain independent. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"With the popularity of social media, detecting sentiment from multimodal posts (e.g. image-text pairs) has attracted substantial attention recently. Existing works mainly focus on fusing different features but ignore the challenge of modality heterogeneity. Specifically, different modalities with inherent disparities may bring three problems: 1) introducing redundant visual features during feature fusion; 2) causing feature shift in the representation space; 3) leading to inconsistent annotations for different modal data. All these issues will increase the difficulty in understanding the sentiment of the multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Calibration Network (MVCN) to alleviate the above issues systematically. We first propose a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to reduce the negative impacts of redundant visual elements. We then devise a sentiment-based congruity constraint task to calibrate the feature shift in the representation space. Finally, we introduce an adaptive loss calibration strategy to tackle inconsistent annotated labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of MVCN against previous approaches and achieve state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Although achieving promising performance, current Natural Language Understanding models tend to utilize dataset biases instead of learning the intended task, which always leads to performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To increase the performance stability, previous debiasing methods empirically capture bias features from data to prevent the model from corresponding biases. However, our analyses show that the empirical debiasing methods may fail to capture part of the dataset biases and mistake semantic information of input text as biases, which limits the effectiveness of debiasing. To address these issues, we propose a debiasing framework IEGDB that comprehensively detects the dataset biases to induce a set of biased features, and purify the biased features with the guidance of information entropy. Experimental results show that IEGDB can consistently improve the stability of performance on OOD datasets for a set of widely adopted NLU models. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."

"The subject of this article is a linguistic analysis of the protest discourse, triggered by the fraudulent elections in Belarus, in August 2020. The 2020 protests became the subject of several scientific publications, but mostly they take into account the socio-cultural aspect of this phenomenon. However, the linguistic aspect requires a systemic and theoretically justified research. The authors of the article are focused on one of the most important elements of this research agenda – the social-symbolic and pragmatic-communicative use of the Belarusian language during the protests.

"Twitter bots are automatic programs operated by malicious actors to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. Research efforts have been made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency. In particular, BIC utilizes a text-graph focused approach to facilitate the two communication styles of social media that may trade useful data throughout the training cycle. In addition, given the stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further analyses reveal that text-graph interactions and modeling semantic consistency are essential improvements and help combat bot evolution. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"End-to-End speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is generally evaluated with text-based metrics. This means that generated speech has to be automatically transcribed, making the evaluation dependent on the availability and quality of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we propose a text-free evaluation metric for end-to-end S2ST, named BLASER, to avoid the dependency on ASR systems. BLASER leverages a multilingual multimodal encoder to directly encode the speech segments for source input, translation output and reference into a shared embedding space and computes a score of the translation quality that can be used as a proxy to human evaluation. To evaluate our approach, we construct training and evaluation sets from more than 40k human annotations covering seven language directions. The best results of BLASER are achieved by training with supervision from human rating scores. We show that when evaluated at the sentence level, BLASER correlates significantly better with human judgment compared to ASR-dependent metrics including ASR-SENTBLEU in all translation directions and ASR-COMET in five of them. Our analysis shows combining speech and text as inputs to BLASER does not increase the correlation with human scores, but best correlations are achieved when using speech, which motivates the goal of our research. Moreover, we show that using ASR for references is detrimental for text-based metrics. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Productivity is a critical performance indicator of the construction industry, and thus warrants effective and efficient construction productivity measurement (CPM). Building information modelling (BIM), a digital representation of the building process, plays a significant role in effective and efficient CPM. Considering the high mandatory requirements for enhancement in construction productivity measurement, this paper aims to review the state-of-the-art literature on BIM-integrated CPM, to identify gaps in the existing body of knowledge and explore future research trends. The aim is achieved through a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis where the data are retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar and proposes future research directions. In total 260 publications were identified from the initial search, and 56 were shortlisted for full-text analysis after several levels of screening including duplication, title and abstract checking. Finally, 21 were narrowed yielded for detailed review for this study. The results mapped the yearly publication trend, publications by source and the co-occurrence of terms. The findings help to identify a suite of BIM-integrated CPM methods used in the construction industry and provide a foundation for future research in CPM. A framework is developed to illustrate the knowledge gap and future directions identified in this study. Accordingly, the findings revealed that existing studies on utilising BIM for CPM are limited to only 3D and 4D BIM. Further, there is a lack of studies on the feasibility of using BIM for CPM, fully automated BIM integrated CPM tools and real-time CPM through BIM. © 2023, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

"Log is a semi-structured text that records the important behavior of the system operation. Through log analysis, we can understand the system behavior, detect system anomaly, locate system fault and even find the root cause of the fault after a fault is found. Generally, log parsing is the first and crucial step of log analysis. In recent years, a great deal of work has been devoted to log parsing. However, most of the work is based on some strong assumptions. These works can achieve good results in some scenarios, but not in others (e.g., the business log of the bank). What's more, their parsing effect is highly dependent on tokenization. In short, these algorithms are weak in robustness, so our paper proposed a robust log parsing algorithm - LogSlaw. LogSlaw is an online log parsing algorithm clustering logs based on the improved Jaccard Similarity, which can perform log parsing on heterogeneous logs with a large amount of data. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of clustering, we proposed to utilize the pseudo log template and the length difference to early grouping and early abandonment. Our algorithm has high parsing efficiency and effectiveness. It can achieve more than four times the efficiency of existing algorithms and get the best results in most datasets. LogSlaw also has strong robustness. It can achieve good results with a very simple tokenization strategy no matter how complex the scene is. We conducted experiments on both the public datasets and the business log datasets from Pacific Credit Card Center of Bank of Communications (PCCC), and achieved SOTA results on both datasets.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The rise of technology in social media has resulted in an enormous quantity of textual ambiguity. Sentiment analysis provides a crux of subjective opinions stored in a large amount of text such that the data gets segregated into positive and negative. In this research two datasets are used i.e., Amazon Reviews and IMDb wherein, first, implemented machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, XGBoost, etc. for the sentiment analysis out of which Linear SVC performed the best for the IMDb dataset and Amazon Reviews dataset. Furthermore, implemented a deep learning model i.e., Bi-LSTM that outperformed machine learning models for both datasets. Next, implemented BERT, a pre-trained language model, showed better results than Bi-LSTM for both datasets. Lastly, proposed a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, wherein, for feature extraction CNN is used, while LSTM is used for classification. The proposed hybrid model has given the best ROC score for both datasets among all the models used in this paper. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of fall prevention programs in people aged 65 years and older involving nursing professionals. Methods: We included available full-text randomized clinical trials on nurse-led prevention of falls in the community in people over 65 years of age and reporting the incidence of such falls. An extensive search was performed in 14 databases covering the period 2016 to 2018 for publications in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. The quality of the papers was assessed independently and blindly by reviewers working in pairs using the risk of bias dominios of the Cochrane Collaboration. The hazard ratio was used as a measure of the effect size of the incidence of falls. A random-effects model was assumed for statistical analyses. The influence of moderator variables of the studies on the effect sizes was performed using ANOVAs and its 95% CI for each moderator category. Results: A total of 31 randomized clinical trials were selected with 25,551 participants. The most frequent type of intervention was education (57.1%), followed by multifactorial models (37.1%). The probability of falling was significantly reduced by 13% in the intervention groups compared to the control groups (RR + = 0.87). Multifactorial (RR + = 0.89) and education-based (RR = +0.84) interventions significantly reduced the probability of falls by 11% and 16%, respectively. Conclusions: Discarding publication bias prevention programs carried out by nurses produce a significant 10% reduction in falls. Education-based and multifactorial interventions are the most effective when conducted by nurses. © 2023"
"The article examines the peculiarities of emotive vocabulary functioning in the hagiographic texts of the 17th–18th centuries based on the material of short and lengthy editions of the Life of the locally venerable Saint Paisius of Uglich. The research paper aims to describe the semantics of emotives and identify the features of their functions implementation in the regional text. Whilst analyzing the lexical meaning of linguistic units, special attention was paid to additional senses that are actualized in the lexical structure of the text. Thus, contextual analysis made it possible to distinguish between close synonyms with the meanings of “joy” – “fun” and “sadness” – “sorrow” through the establishment of a hierarchy of antonymic oppositions: “joy” – “sadness” as related to the divine, always socially approved feelings experienced by the subject within himself, and “fun” – “sorrow” as often having external manifestations associated with everyday life, not always socially approved emotional experiences. The main linguistic functions of emotives are characterological, which is found in the description of emotional experiences of characters, and text-forming, explicated through the correlation of emotives that denote dominant emotions in the text of the function. The connection of the emotives used in the Life with a certain territory is noted to be indirect, as the realization of plot-forming and ideological functions that allow recreating a special cultural code, understandable and recognizable by the reader. © 2023, Volgograd State University.

"Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to determine whether the author of a text is in favor of, against, or neutral toward a target that is unseen during training. Despite the growing attention on ZSSD, most recent advances in this task are limited to English and do not pay much attention to other languages such as Chinese. To support ZSSD research, in this paper, we present C-STANCE that, to our knowledge, is the first Chinese dataset for zero-shot stance detection. We introduce two challenging subtasks for ZSSD: target-based ZSSD and domain-based ZSSD. Our dataset includes both noun-phrase targets and claim targets, covering a wide range of domains. We provide a detailed description and analysis of our dataset. To establish results on C-STANCE, we report performance scores using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

"The study validates feasibility of interdisciplinary research into the problem of emotions and the language. The term text emotiogenicity is contrasted with the terms emotivity and emotionality. The emotional impact of the text upon the addressee is investigated experimentally. In accordance with V.P. Belyanin’s classification, the two emotive literary texts, chosen as research material, represent “bright” and “sorrowful” types. The experiment involved the students of Saint Petersburg State Theater Arts Academy and the students of Herzen University. The auditive analysis of the readers’ intonation was carried out to interpret the emotiogenicity of these texts. The high degree of text emotiogenicity actualizes when the addressee experiences the same emotions as the literary text character. In this case the emotions are expressed in reader’s intonation. The prosodic correlates of admiration and tenderness when a person reads the “bright” text and the correlates of fatality and depression while reading the “sorrowful” text are described. The emotiogenicity of the same text is apt to vary depending on the personality of the recipient. The author identifies the main reasons for variable prosodic correlates of contrary emotions when reading emotive literary texts. © 2023, Volgograd State University. All rights reserved."
"Using Convolutional neural network to create a robust handwritten equation solver is difficult in image processing and classifying. One of the most difficult challenges and extremities in computer vision research is handwritten mathematical expression recognition. The work is made more difficult because certain characters are segmented and classified—a collection of quadratic equations created by hand. Polynomial, quadratic and other mathematical equations must be recognized and solved. The goal of this project is to develop a process that makes learning easier and attractive to the student, especially in today's age. This project is made to develop an application which can Solve a Handwritten Equation (Arithmetic, quadratic, trigonometric). And it will also be capable of solving Logical Operation (logical AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR, NOR) trained by digits written by hands and mathematical characters or symbols using Convolutional Neural Network with picture processing techniques to achieve maximum accuracy, and it will also Extract Text from Images. One can also learn and share educational content on the platform to share knowledge. Major advantage of online learning is that it ensures you are in sync with modern learners and teachers. This allows the learners to access the updated content and media whenever they want. It also allows users to take tests on various topics and provide immediate results. Users can also code on this platform in any language, i.e., C, Python and Java. One can also monitor their performance on the application and work on improving it significantly. It helps modern generation students focus on practical knowledge and implement it in the easiest way possible. It does homework easy and coding more accessible. Horizontal compact projection analysis and survey is used for segmentation and binarization. We use both connected component analysis and integrated connected component analysis methodologies here. CNN Characters are classified using a network. Each appropriate character is required for the solution of the problem. Character string operation is used for the detection of characters in the polynomial. Finally, the experiment results show that the strategy we've described is quite effective t.

"Deep learning has recently been successful in numerous academic areas, including social network filtering, image processing, machine translation, and text mining. There is a lot of user-generated content available on various social media sites. that can be used for precise opinion analysis of the shifting market dynamics. Aspect word extraction (AWE) task detects the targets of user opinions from the text in aspect-level sentiment analysis (ABSA). The majority of aspect retrieval methods depend on a certain domain or context. Additionally, it is difficult to identify the most pertinent aspect phrases that are domain-specific because there is a deficiency of topic and situational knowledge. The current methods fail to extract some useful aspect terms because they are unable to identify noun phrase dependencies over time. In order to enhance the AWE challenge, this research suggests a combined language patterns with deep learning methods. On typical review datasets, results from studies and experiments are examined for many kinds of aspects.  © 2023 IEEE."
"This article contends that the representation of human-nature relationship in children’s literature can map onto its gender politics through a comparative study of multimodal dynamics of Irish and Persian picturebooks. It builds upon the premise that children’s literature can play a significant role in sustainable education and forming pro-environmental values in the process of socialization during childhood. Oliver Jeffers’ The Fate of Fausto: A Painted Fable (2019) and Hoda Hadadi’s I’ll Sow My Hands in the Garden (2020) are examined within the framework of environmental humanities for their verbal and pictorial depictions of the human-nature relationship. The findings convey that characters’ gender and sexual identities can impact their interactions with nature; at the same time, nature can clear a space for expressing and affirming underrepresented and historically marginalized gender and sexual identities in children’s literature through creative and dynamic multimodal interactions between the text and illustrations. A comparative analysis reveals that Jeffers challenges abstract, absolute masculinity and masculine arrogance and calls for reforming the notion of need in modern societies, while more playful and transgressive dynamics between the text and illustrations provide an effective tool for Hadadi who appropriates the poetry of Forugh Farrokhzad, a maverick female writer, to undermine the plots of male homo-sociality and erotic counterplotting with a subversive alternative to heteropatriarchy and anthropocentrism. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Acute cholecystitis accounts for up to 9% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain, and best practice entails early surgical management. Ultrasound is the standard modality used to confirm diagnosis. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician–performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis when compared with a reference standard of final diagnosis (informed by available surgical pathology, discharge diagnosis, and radiology-performed ultrasound). We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO, in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched 7 databases as well as gray literature in the form of select conference abstracts from inception to February 8, 2023. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2) assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies to create 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis. Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic models were constructed. Of 1855 titles/abstracts, 40 were selected for full-text review. Ten studies (n=2356) were included. Emergency physician–performed point-of-care ultrasound with final diagnosis as the reference standard (7 studies, n=1,772) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.3 to 78.2), specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 88.2 to 97.5), positive likelihood ratio of 12.7 (5.8 to 27.5), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.31 (0.23 to 0.41) for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Emergency physician–performed point-of-care ultrasound has high specificity and moderate sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients with clinical suspicion. This review supports the use of emergency physician–performed point-of-care ultrasound to rule in a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in the emergency department, which may help expedite definitive management. © 2023 American College of Emergency Physicians"
"Most existing cross-lingual summarization (CLS) work constructs CLS corpora by simply and directly translating pre-annotated summaries from one language to another, which can contain errors from both summarization and translation processes. To address this issue, we propose ConvSumX, a cross-lingual conversation summarization benchmark, through a new annotation schema that explicitly considers source input context. ConvSumX consists of 2 sub-tasks under different real-world scenarios, with each covering 3 language directions. We conduct thorough analysis on ConvSumX and 3 widely-used manually annotated CLS corpora and empirically find that ConvSumX is more faithful towards input text. Additionally, based on the same intuition, we propose a 2-Step method, which takes both conversation and summary as input to simulate human annotation process. Experimental results show that 2-Step method surpasses strong baselines on ConvSumX under both automatic and human evaluation. Analysis shows that both source input text and summary are crucial for modeling cross-lingual summaries. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Due to the expansion of multimedia data types and accessible bandwidth, there is an increasing demand for video retrieval systems as consumers move away from text-based retrieval systems and towards content-based retrieval systems. Regardless of the video attributes used, the choice of extracted features is essential in content-based video retrieval. Over the past ten years, researchers have studied the content-based video retrieval (CBVR) system, which is based on numerous applications, advancements, and technologies. There is still a need in video retrieval systems for the extraction of high-level semantic elements as well as the processing of low-level materials. Researchers are actively focusing on the importance of feature extraction and processing speed in large-scale video retrieval systems. This study seeks to stabilise accuracy while reducing the processing time required to extract the movies using existing deep learning models. Deep learning models will be fine-tuned to extract features and blend them with manually constructed features. We separated the movies to locate elements that matched the human-defined interest in order to fulfil the goal of content-based video retrieval. The primary role of video analysis is object detection and classification. To obtain the true result, we separate the foreground object from the background, perform localisation on each extracted frame from a video, measure the intensity histogram of 8-oriented frames, and then use the active appearance model (AAM), convolutional neural network (CNN), Gabor filter, and Haar cascade algorithms. We integrated more than 2000 films and used two datasets—YouTube and SegTek—as well as cluster computing to get the most sophisticated object detection and segmentation results. We provide a method for training and testing text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) and video-to-text retrieval (V2TR) using a video captioning dataset in this study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"We read numerous news content every day, yet a single news subject may not include all of the important information. We can obtain useful information from the comprehensive articles, which will save us a lot of time and energy. Text summarization is a method of compressing a lengthy text into a comprehensible summary while preserving the information content and its overall meaning. This system will help us enhance the readability of a particular news article without missing any important points. To understand the sentiment of the news items, Sentiment Analysis is conducted on the summary.

"Short text clustering is challenging since it takes imbalanced and noisy data as inputs. Existing approaches cannot solve this problem well, since (1) they are prone to obtain degenerate solutions especially on heavy imbalanced datasets, and (2) they are vulnerable to noises. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Robust Short Text Clustering (RSTC) model to improve robustness against imbalanced and noisy data. RSTC includes two modules, i.e., pseudo-label generation module and robust representation learning module. The former generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for the later, which contributes to more robust representations and correctly separated clusters. To provide robustness against the imbalance in data, we propose self-adaptive optimal transport in the pseudo-label generation module. To improve robustness against the noise in data, we further introduce both class-wise and instance-wise contrastive learning in the robust representation learning module. Our empirical studies on eight short text clustering datasets demonstrate that RSTC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

"Target-dependent sentiment classification (TSC) enables a fine-grained automatic analysis of sentiments expressed in texts. Sentiment expression varies depending on the domain, and it is necessary to create domain-specific datasets. While socially important, TSC in the news domain remains relatively understudied. We introduce MAD-TSC, the first multilingual aligned dataset designed for TSC in news. MAD-TSC differs substantially from existing resources. First, it includes aligned examples in eight languages to facilitate a comparison of performance for individual languages, and a direct comparison of human and machine translation. Second, the dataset is sampled from a diversified parallel news corpus, and is diversified in terms of news sources and geographic spread of entities. Finally, MAD-TSC is more challenging than existing datasets because its samples are more complex. We exemplify the use of MAD-TSC with comprehensive monolingual and multilingual experiments. The latter shows that machine translations can successfully replace manual ones, and that performance for all included languages can match that of English by automatically translating test examples. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Previous work on controllable text generation has explored the idea of control from the latent space, such as optimizing a representation with attribute-specific classifiers or sampling one from relevant discrete samples. However, they cannot effectively model a complex space with diverse attributes, high dimensionality, and asymmetric structure, leaving subsequent controls unsatisfying. In this work, we propose a novel control framework using probability density estimation in the latent space. Our method utilizes an invertible transformation function, the Normalizing Flow, that maps the complex distributions in the latent space to simple Gaussian distributions in the prior space. Thus, we can perform sophisticated and flexible controls in the prior space and feed the control effects back into the latent space owing to the bijection property of invertible transformations. Experiments on single-attribute and multi-attribute control reveal that our method outperforms several strong baselines on attribute relevance and text quality, achieving a new SOTA. Further analysis of control strength adjustment demonstrates the flexibility of our control strategy. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

"A 5-day diary study examined how channel affordances are related to channel use and outcomes in romantic conflict. Adults answered five consecutive days of surveys about daily conflict occurrence, channel affordances, channel use, and conflict behavior. The results of a 1-1-1 multilevel mediation analysis showed negative within-indirect effects for the channel affordances of editability and persistence on constructive conflict behavior via mobile text messaging, and a positive within-indirect effect for the channel affordance of bandwidth on constructive conflict behavior via face-to-face communication. The data suggest that channel affordances motivate channel use in romantic conflict and that these channel affordances are indirectly related to constructive conflict behavior.  © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing."
"Background: Students who are blind are integrated into public schools in many countries, yet are often excluded from full participation in science since most learning materials are visual. To create a compensatory route, an existing model-based inquiry-learning environment was adapted by means of sonification (addition of non-speech sounds that represent dynamic information). The learning environment uses agent-based models and a complex systems approach to teach the Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) and Gas Laws. The models are accompanied by a workbook consisting of text (printed or auditory) and images (printed or tactile). Objectives: The current research examined whether such perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment for learners who are blind compared with learners who are sighted using the original learning environment. The aim of the study is to expand knowledge about how the auditory channel may compensate the visual channel among individuals who are blind. Methods: Conceptual learning in science and reasoning about complex systems were assessed using pre- and post-questionnaires. To explore learners' learning progression throughout the unit, four progression analysis ‘windows’ were selected. These were groups of adjacent or nearly adjacent items in the workbook that permitted a glimpse of learners' progression. Results: The sonified environment not only supported the learning of learners who are blind compared with the learning of learners who are sighted using visual material, but even furthered their learning with respect to diffusion, one of the more challenging concepts in KMT. It seems the types of sonified representations used in this study increased listeners' sensitivity to the micro-level interactions in a way less accessible in visual representations. Takeaways: Sonified environments can be provide learners who are blind with equitable participation by compensating and complementing the visual channel. Sonification can have implications for students who are blind as well as students who are sighted. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Computer Assisted Learning published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"In this paper, we introduce Cross-View Language Modeling, a simple and effective pretraining framework that unifies cross-lingual and cross-modal pre-training with shared architectures and objectives. Our approach is motivated by a key observation that cross-lingual and cross-modal pre-training share the same goal of aligning two different views of the same object into a common semantic space. To this end, the cross-view language modeling framework considers both multi-modal data (i.e., image-caption pairs) and multi-lingual data (i.e., parallel sentence pairs) as two different views of the same object, and trains the model to align the two views by maximizing the mutual information between them with conditional masked language modeling and contrastive learning. We pre-train CCLM, a Cross-lingual Cross-modal Language Model, with the cross-view language modeling framework. Empirical results on IGLUE, a multi-lingual multi-modal benchmark, and two multi-lingual image-text retrieval datasets show that while conceptually simpler, CCLM significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art with an average absolute improvement of over 10%. Moreover, CCLM is the first multi-lingual multimodal pre-trained model that surpasses the translate-test performance of representative English vision-language models by zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Today, it's common to use depression detection to understand how people are feeling in different situations in their daily lives. Social media data, including text data, emoticons, emojis, and other symbols, is used throughout the process, including the analysis and classification phases. In previous studies, binomial and trinomial classifications were widely used, but multiclass classification provides more accurate analysis. In multiclass classification, polarity is used to separate data into various subclasses. Deep learning and machine learning techniques are used in the categorization process. Depression levels can be guided or analyzed through social media. The purpose of this research is to present an overview of depression identification in social media data using various artificial intelligence algorithms to detect anxiety and sadness. Text, emoticons, and emojis from social media were visually recorded and used for sentiment identification using a variety of artificial intelligence approaches in this study. In sentiment analysis, multiclass categorization utilizing deep learning algorithms yields higher efficiency ratings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Various design settings for in-context learning (ICL), such as the choice and order of the in-context examples, can bias the model's predictions. While many studies discuss these design choices, there have been few systematic investigations into categorizing them and mitigating their impact. In this work, we define a typology for three types of label biases in ICL for text classification: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias (which we conceptualize and detect for the first time). Our analysis demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fall short of addressing all three types of biases. Specifically, domain-label bias restricts LLMs to random-level performance on many tasks regardless of the choice of in-context examples. To mitigate the effect of these biases, we propose a simple bias calibration method that estimates a language model's label bias using random in-domain words from the task corpus. After controlling for this estimated bias when making predictions, our novel domain-context calibration significantly improves the ICL performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 on a wide range of tasks. The gain is substantial on tasks with large domain-label bias (up to 37% in Macro-F1). Furthermore, our results generalize to models with different scales, pretraining methods, and manually-designed task instructions, showing the prevalence of label biases in ICL. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied for their ability to store and utilize positive knowledge. However, negative knowledge, such as “lions don't live in the ocean”, is also ubiquitous in the world but rarely mentioned explicitly in the text. What do LLMs know about negative knowledge? This work examines the ability of LLMs to negative commonsense knowledge. We design a constrained keyw ords-to-sentence generation task (CG) and a Boolean question-answering task (QA) to probe LLMs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs frequently fail to generate valid sentences grounded in negative commonsense knowledge, yet they can correctly answer polar yes-or-no questions. We term this phenomenon the belief conflict of LLMs. Our further analysis shows that statistical shortcuts and negation reporting bias from language modeling pre-training cause this conflict. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The volume and scale of data being generated by social media is incrementing exponentially day by day. Private and public outlooks on various subjects or issues are expressed on social media. Sentiment analysis is a technique of examining and recognizing the sentiment of a statement that it embodies. Over the past decade, Twitter has emerged as a global leader in the social media industry, where people from around the world share their opinions and thoughts on events that occur all across the world. Sentiment analysis is a process of recognizing the sentiment of the Twitter data (tweets) conveyed by the user. In this study, we provide a survey and comparative analysis of existing techniques for opinion mining. This research paper mentions the pre-processing steps performed on the raw twitter data, including removing URLs, usernames, emojis, and stop words, and stemming to produce morphological variants of base words. Word clouds and frequency distributions of hashtags used in Racial and Non-Racial tweets were generated. The Bag of Words model was used for feature extraction, which involved converting text into a numerical matrix.

"Autoregressive (AR) generation almost dominates sequence generation for its efficacy. Recently, non-autoregressive (NAR) generation gains increasing popularity for its efficiency and growing efficacy. However, its efficiency is still bottlenecked by quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, which is prohibitive for scaling to long sequence generation and few works have been done to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel MLP variant, Attentive Multi-Layer Perceptron (AMLP), to produce a generation model with linear time and space complexity. Different from classic MLP with static and learnable projection matrices, AMLP leverages adaptive projections computed from inputs in an attentive mode. The sample-aware adaptive projections enable communications among tokens in a sequence, and model the measurement between the query and key space. Furthermore, we marry AMLP with popular NAR models, deriving a highly efficient NAR-AMLP architecture with linear time and space complexity. Empirical results show that such marriage architecture surpasses competitive efficient NAR models, by a significant margin on text-to-speech synthesis and machine translation. We also test AMLP’s self- and cross-attention ability separately with extensive ablation experiments, and find them comparable or even superior to the other efficient models. The efficiency analysis further shows that AMLP extremely reduces the memory cost against vanilla non-autoregressive models for long sequences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Teaching a foreign language within the framework of an online course has its specifics. Control in such courses is characterised by a lack of feedback from the teacher (only self-learning of course materials is assumed), a decrease in the individualization of learning, an increase in the role of students' independent work, which leads to the use of a method of mutual checking and the associated need to develop students' cognitive abilities for self-assessment of the results of mastering an online course. The development of such abilities is particularly relevant in the online course “Russian as a foreign language”, where students need to evaluate texts in a foreign language. The aim of the research is to introduce conceptually a step-by-step training model for introducing peer review tasks within an online course in Russian as a foreign language and evaluate its effectiveness. The peer checking assignments in the block “We write in Russian” from the massive online course “Russian as a foreign language. B1+” on the “Otkrytoye Obrazovaniye” (Open Education) platform were used as the data for the study. The general scientific method of analysis and synthesis, targeted observation and the modeling method were applied. An overview of the main research papers on the forms of control in massive online courses is given. Attention is drawn to such features of control in a distance learning course as the lack of feedback from the teacher, a decrease in the individualization of learning, an increase in the role of students' independent work, and the related need to develop students' cognitive abilities to evaluate a text according to the developed criteria. The stages of formation of the cognitive procedures of different levels are considered - from the level of rules to the cognitive level associated with the students' awareness of their cognitive strategies, their effectiveness, as well as the ability to independently assess their language and speech level. As the result of the study, the authors present a training model of tasks aimed at forming students’ competence of an “expert” who can check the peer checking tasks. It is concluded that students can adequately evaluate each other's academic work, using the proposed evaluation parameters, taking into account the type of the text, its genre, and the typical language means of its implementation. The submitted step-by-step training model of tasks for peer review can be successfully used in teaching other foreign languages at different levels. © Попова Т.И., Колесова Д.В., 2023."
"Request for Information (RFI) is an essential communication and decision support tool that assists project teams in identifying and resolving construction queries. RFI occurrences are common throughout the project lifecycle and predominantly comprise issues related to conflicting drawings and specifications, unclear requirements, vague contract documents or unexpected site conditions that inhibit project progress. RFIs are typically unstructured textual documents, and their manual content analysis for knowledge extraction is arduous and time-consuming. Previous research has successfully harnessed the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining to process unstructured text documents and extract useful information. While NLP and text mining approaches have been applied in different domains, their application in the construction industry is limited, particularly for analysing RFI datasets. Hence, the present research analyses RFIs and their query subjects through an unsupervised learning approach. Key contributions include the implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised text-mining algorithm to identify predominant topics and themes to classify the issues discussed within RFIs. This analysis successfully identified and highlighted issues related to structural discrepancies, construction coordination, building fixtures, building specifications and construction drawings as prominent problems mentioned in the project RFIs. As exploratory research, the findings of this study aim to enhance the understanding of RFI issues and to inspire future investigations that can delve deeper into specific aspects of the RFI review process and motivate future studies, which efficiently dissect, and address issues related to RFIs.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Hate speech is a conundrum that is spreading like wildfire. Social networks allow members to connect by a variety of common interests and share information.

"Blind source separation is widely used in image and speech encryption in the last two decades. The main drawback of BSS-based cryptosystem is its linear structure, which makes it vulnerable against all kinds of cryptanalytic attacks. Inserting the nonlinearity in encryption phase is a solution to make the cryptosystem more secure. In this paper, we focus on the nonlinearity effect on BSS-based cryptosystem. To increase the security, four types of nonlinear functions are introduced and evaluated. The presented nonlinear functions increase the nonlinearity effect of cryptosystem. They improve the security by 32–45% in different kinds of sparse and none sparse plain images based on FSIM criteria. The FSIM is a similarity measurement criterion based on human visual system (HVS) established on images feature. Due to the successful operation of the introduced nonlinear functions, a new cryptosystem is proposed based on post-nonlinear BSS. Compared with previous presented BSS-based cryptosystems, which often were vulnerable against cipher text-only differential attack, the proposed cryptosystem is robust against this attack and has a high sensitivity to key. Furthermore, due to the unconditional decryption process, there is no restriction on the sparse and correlated plain images for encryption and decryption. Simulation and analysis display the proposed method increases the security of BSS-based cryptosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"We propose a new paradigm for universal information extraction (IE) that is compatible with any schema format and applicable to a list of IE tasks, such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction and sentiment analysis. Our approach converts the text-based IE tasks as the token-pair problem, which uniformly disassembles all extraction targets into joint span detection, classification and association problems with a unified extractive framework, namely UniEX. UniEX can synchronously encode schema-based prompt and textual information, and collaboratively learn the generalized knowledge from pre-defined information using the auto-encoder language models. We develop a traffine attention mechanism to integrate heterogeneous factors including tasks, labels and inside tokens, and obtain the extraction target via a scoring matrix. Experiment results show that UniEX can outperform generative universal IE models in terms of performance and inference-speed on 14 benchmarks IE datasets with the supervised setting. The state-of-the-art performance in low-resource scenarios also verifies the transferability and effectiveness of UniEX. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot performance, but the performance can be sensitive to the selection of few-shot instances. We present PATRON, a prompt-based data selection method for pretrained language model fine-tuning under cold-start scenarios, i.e., no initial labeled data are available. In PATRON, we design (1) a prompt-based uncertainty propagation approach to estimate the importance of data points and (2) a partition-then-rewrite (PTR) strategy to promote sample diversity when querying for annotations. Experiments on six text classification datasets show that PATRON outperforms the strongest cold-start data selection baselines by up to 6.9%. Besides, with 128 labels only, PATRON achieves 91.0% and 92.1% of the fully supervised performance based on vanilla fine-tuning and prompt-based learning respectively.

"Wireless power transmission (WPT), also known as wireless charging technology, brings convenience to people's lives, particularly in the new energy vehicle industry, where the advantages of wireless charging over wired charging are more evident. However, traditional single-to-single WPT modes present various challenges, including high voltage and current stresses, substantial power loss, and excessive heat generation. These issues primarily stem from the significant power demands of electric vehicles. To address this issue, this text proposes a single-transmitter triple-receiver WPT system, where three receiving coils are connected in series and collectively deliver power to a load. This configuration enhances the output power while reducing the voltage and current stress, thereby improving system efficiency. Furthermore, this approach eliminates the need for an additional DC/DC circuit for voltage boosting, resulting in a simple and reliable circuit design. The main work involves modelling the system and performing parameter characteristic analysis. After selecting appropriate parameter values, circuit simulations are conducted using the Simulink platform. Based on the simulation results, the system exhibits the following parameters: an input voltage of 200V, an output voltage of 385V, all three currents are within 20A, resulting in a power output of 7382 W, and an efficiency of 81%.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Similes occur in the creative context of describing a concept (i.e., tenor) by making a literally false yet figuratively meaningful comparison to another (i.e., vehicle). Previous efforts form simile generation as a context-free generation task, focusing on simile-style transfer or writing a simile from a given prefix. However, generated texts under such settings might be undesirable, such as hardly meeting the simile definition (e.g., missing vehicle) or difficult to address certain preferences of content as humans wish (e.g., describe the color of apples through the simile). We believe that a simile could be more qualified and user-oriented if incorporated with pre-specified constraints. To this end, we introduce controllable simile generation (CSG), a new task that requires the model to generate a simile with multiple simile elements, e.g., context and vehicle. To facilitate this task, we present GraCe, including 61.3k simile-element annotated Chinese similes. Based on it, we propose a CSG model Similor to benchmark this task, including a vehicle retrieval module Scorer to obtain the explicable comparison for a given tenor in the vehicle-unknown situation. Both statistical and experimental analyses show that GraCe is of high quality beyond all other Chinese simile datasets, in terms of the number (8 vs. 3) of annotation elements, Is-Simile accuracy (98.9% vs. 78.7%), and increasing model-performance gains for both uncontrollable and controllable simile generation. Meanwhile, Similor can serve as a strong baseline for CSG, especially with Scorer, which beats model-based retrieval methods without any re-training. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Tracking characters and locations throughout a story can help improve the understanding of its plot structure. Prior research has analyzed characters and locations from text independently without grounding characters to their locations in narrative time. Here, we address this gap by proposing a new spatial relationship categorization task. The objective of the task is to assign a spatial relationship category for every character and location co-mention within a window of text, taking into consideration linguistic context, narrative tense, and temporal scope. To this end, we annotate spatial relationships in approximately 2500 book excerpts and train a model using contextual embeddings as features to predict these relationships. When applied to a set of books, this model allows us to test several hypotheses on mobility and domestic space, revealing that protagonists are more mobile than non-central characters and that women as characters tend to occupy more interior space than men. Overall, our work is the first step towards joint modeling and analysis of characters and places in narrative text. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Without standardized roadmap, firms in the healthcare sectors have found it challenging to adopt digital transformation. This study, based on signaling theory, alleviated the issue by applying automated information extraction to retrieve such demanding knowledge from firms’ information disclosure while avoiding a tedious and time-consuming task of manually extracting information from huge text documents. The main objectives of this study were 1) to extract evolving business activities relating to digital healthcare transformation and 2) to identify whether extracted business activities align with a particular digital maturity model. The samples were firms listed in the healthcare sector of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. The data was obtained from firms’ annual reports covered period 2017–2021. To extract business activities, this study employed phrase extraction technique based on words’ parts of speech tagging. The extracted phrases then were filtered using custom-made dictionary. The findings indicated that while investing in key infrastructure and leveraging digital technology to improve business processes made up the majority of a company’s early period business activities, later timeframe business activities were more focused on value generation activities and new business models creation. The changes of activities in different periods also suggested that some business activities might require prerequisite activities. Assigning extracted business activities into relevant dimensions of the specific maturity model further proved that the extracted business activities adhere to the elements of chosen digital maturity model. The elements carried out by firms expressed the nature of the sector as well as how highly they prioritize digital transformation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Sentiment analysis is a significant undertaking that requires attention from the product and service suppliers to provide beneficial outcomes. Different models are used in practise. However, they are not accurate. In this work, three machine learning models were considered for sentiment analysis of movie reviews obtained from Netflix; the models are Logistic regression, Naive Bayes and Random forest. Among the models under consideration, the most effective machine learning model for sentiment analysis is chosen, and it is compared to the deep learning model. Recurrent neural networks with word embeddings and an LSTM layer enable the deep learning model. The deep learning model's accuracy of 94.3 percent is significantly greater than that of the other models. The algorithm is able to determine the percentage of positive material and the percentage of negative content in reviews in addition to categorising them as positive or negative. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023."
"Given a limited labeling budget, active learning (al) aims to sample the most informative instances from an unlabeled pool to acquire labels for subsequent model training. To achieve this, al typically measures the informativeness of unlabeled instances based on uncertainty and diversity. However, it does not consider erroneous instances with their neighborhood error density, which have great potential to improve the model performance. To address this limitation, we propose Real, a novel approach to select data instances with Representative Errors for Active Learning. It identifies minority predictions as pseudo errors within a cluster and allocates an adaptive sampling budget for the cluster based on estimated error density. Extensive experiments on five text classification datasets demonstrate that Real consistently outperforms all best-performing baselines regarding accuracy and F1-macro scores across a wide range of hyperparameter settings. Our analysis also shows that Real selects the most representative pseudo errors that match the distribution of ground-truth errors along the decision boundary.

"Audio-visual text generation aims to understand multi-modality contents and translate them into texts. Although various transfer learning techniques of text generation have been proposed, they focused on uni-modal analysis (e.g., text-to-text, visual-to-text) and lack consideration of multi-modal content and cross-modal relation. Motivated by the fact that humans can recognize the timbre of the same low-level concepts (e.g., footstep, rainfall, and laughing), even in different visual conditions, we aim to mitigate the domain discrepancies by audiovisual correlation. In this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation framework, named TAVT, which consists of two key components: Audio-Visual Meta-Mapper (AVMM) and Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCCL). (1) AVMM first introduces a universal auditory semantic space and drifts the domain-invariant low-level concepts into visual prefixes. Then the reconstruct-based learning encourages the AVMM to learn “which pixels belong to the same sound” and achieve audio-enhanced visual prefix. The well-trained AVMM can be further applied to uni-modal setting. (2) Furthermore, DCCL leverages the destructive counterfactual transformations to provide cross-modal constraints for AVMM from the perspective of feature distribution and text generation. (3) The experimental results show that TAVT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains (cross-datasets, cross-categories) and various modal settings (uni-modal, multi-modal). © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Digital transformation (DT) offers major improvement of a business by significantly changing its characteristics through the combination of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies by using new digital technologies. To take advantage of these opportunities, certain competences are required. However, not all of the required competences can be fulfilled by the current employees. To fill these gaps, companies are looking for employees with different competence sets on employment websites. Most studies analyzing competences for DT are conducting interviews, questionnaires, or performing literature reviews which disregards the actual requirements of companies looking for employees to conquer DT. To better understand what competences companies are looking for in the labor market, we conducted a content analysis of job advertisements on StepStone. Using text mining, data mining, and a subsequent manual analysis of 3,138 job advertisements posted on a relevant employment website, we were able to derive 23 different competences relevant to DT. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Missing punctuation makes texts difficult to understand and confusing to read, be it in formal or casual writing. What punctuation marking does is that it defines sentence constituents and sentence boundaries, which is critical to such Natural Language Processing (NLP) downstream tasks as machine translation, automatic speech analysis and synthesis. Although there is a rising amount of accessible Arabic data on the Web, the majority of it either doesn’t contain any punctuation or it uses punctuation inappropriately. To the best of our knowledge, very few people in the Arabic NLP community have considered this issue. This paper aims to present a method for automatically punctuating Arabic text using a model based on a pre-trained transformer. The goal of the Arabic punctuation prediction is to identify and insert the appropriate punctuation marks in punctuation-stripped Arabic texts. Using a robust dataset with a large number of punctuated sentences, we trained and tested the system. The experimental results show that AraBERT v0.2 (Antoun et al. in Arabert: transformer-based model for Arabic language understanding, [1]) and AraELECTRA discriminator (Antoun et al. in AraELECTRA: pre-training text discriminators for Arabic language understanding, [2]) achieved the highest accuracies, 95.88% and 95.86% respectively, and overall F1-scores. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"Requirements Engineering (RE) has emerged as an independent discipline in recent decades and is no longer considered a peripheral topic in software engineering. However, teaching this discipline to students poses challenges for educators in higher education, as it requires developing soft skills, decision-making abilities, practical application knowledge, and providing theoretical content. This Ph.D. project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of RE teaching and investigate how Swiss universities address these challenges to produce 'industry-ready' students. The study will use an Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design involving interviews with RE lecturers and analysis of module descriptions to gather information on curricula, degree programs, subject integration, prerequisites, and instructional approaches. An online questionnaire will assess former students' perception of the RE course, suitable prerequisites, and instructional methods. Examining the collected data will reveal potential relationships between prerequisites, instructional approaches, and students' comprehension of RE. Text mining will be employed to compare industry needs with university curricula, analyzing Swiss job advertisements for RE positions to gain insights into desired skills and certifications. By analyzing the collected data, potential relationships between prerequisites, instructional approaches, and students' comprehension of RE will be examined. The findings may enhance teaching approaches in Requirements Engineering Education (REE) in Switzerland and beyond.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to predict the sentiment of video content. Recent research suggests that multimodal sentiment analysis critically depends on learning a good representation of multimodal information, which should contain both modality-invariant representations that are consistent across modalities as well as modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose ConFEDE, a unified learning framework that jointly performs contrastive representation learning and contrastive feature decomposition to enhance representation of multimodal information. It decomposes each of the three modalities of a video sample, including text, video frames, and audio, into a similarity feature and a dissimilarity feature, which are learned by a contrastive relation centered around text. We conducted extensive experiments on CH-SIMS, MOSI and MOSEI to evaluate various state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods. Experimental results show that ConFEDE outperforms all baselines on these datasets on a range of metrics. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Twitter boasts 319 million daily active users, making it an invaluable asset for public figures and businesses looking to cultivate positive public image. Businesses can leverage sentiment analysis for real-time polling on various social media platforms allowing them to gauge public sentiment and opinion accurately. Recently, academic researchers focused on sentiment analysis as an approach for Twitter propaganda analysis. Text sentiment analysis is an automated process that offers valuable insight into the content of a text segment. It can reveal whether it conveys factual or subjective information and reveal its polarity; for Twitter sentiment classification this goal primarily lies with determining whether tweets have positive or negative undertones; researchers utilize various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and other models to accomplish this task. Present research work utilising classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines are among the most frequently utilized ML/DL models for sentiment analysis, along with Random Forest, Ensemble Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for effective classification. Also, for preprocessing the tweets API, techniques such as filtering, tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming and lemmatization have been used. Then preprocessed input is fed as input to the TF-IDF and Bag of Words for vectorize the input. Then classification has been performed with aforementioned models. Finally, performance evaluation metrices have been perfomed, from that out of all these models used for sentiment analysis on Twitter dataset, Bidirectional LSTM has proven itself most accurate at detecting sentiment with an accuracy rate of 98.14%, 98.39% in vectorize techniques includes TF-IDF and Bag of Words—making this tool invaluable when conducting voice analyses on this platform. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Automatic text summarization (ATS) plays a significant role in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Abstractive summarization produces summaries by identifying and compressing the most important information in a document. However, there are only relatively several comprehensively evaluated abstractive summarization models that work well for specific types of reports due to their unstructured and oral language text characteristics. In particular, Chinese complaint reports, generated by urban complainers and collected by government employees, describe existing resident problems in daily life. Meanwhile, the reflected problems are required to respond speedily. Therefore, automatic summarization tasks for these reports have been developed. However, similar to traditional summarization models, the generated summaries still exist problems of informativeness and conciseness. To address these issues and generate suitably informative and less redundant summaries, a topic-based abstractive summarization method is proposed to obtain global and local features. Additionally, a heterogeneous graph of the original document is constructed using word-level and topic-level features. Experiments and analyses on public review datasets (Yelp and Amazon) and our constructed dataset (Chinese complaint reports) show that the proposed framework effectively improves the performance of the abstractive summarization model for Chinese complaint reports. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has elicited a diverse array of responses from nations around the globe. During a global conflict, polarized narratives are spread on social media to sway public opinion. We examine the dynamics of the political narratives surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war during the first two months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (RU) using the Chinese Twitter space as a case study. Since the beginning of the RU, pro-Chinese-state and anti-Chinese-state users have spread divisive opinions, rumors, and conspiracy theories. We investigate how the pro- and anti-state camps contributed to the evolution of RU-related narratives, as well as how a few influential accounts drove the narrative evolution. We identify pro-state and anti-state actors on Twitter using network analysis and text-based classifiers, and we leverage text analysis, along with the users’ social interactions (e.g., retweeting), to extract narrative coordination and evolution. We find evidence that both pro-state and anti-state camps spread propaganda narratives about RU. Our analysis illuminates how actors coordinate to advance particular viewpoints or act against one another in the context of global conflict. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Among the enormous volume of data available, the recommender system assists users in locating useful information that meets their needs. Video and audio recordings are complex media and linking datasets that satisfy defined requirements is becoming an increasingly significant, but challenging endeavor. As part of this paper, we propose a data linkage approach for matching audio recordings to related music videos. A cooperative method was introduced utilizing the Elasticsearch search engine primarily for preprocessing. Data features were further aggregated using text data matching scores, date and time features, popularity scores, and data completeness scores. We automated the machine learning process using PyCaret, which gave us more time for analysis and less time for coding. Experiments demonstrate that this method can generate a ranking of significant features and performance tracking that improves the efficacy of data linking. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"While the past two decades have witnessed enormous growth in research on student engagement with feedback on second language (L2) writing, little attention has been paid to student engagement with peer feedback longitudinally through peer feedback interaction. This study explored how 12 students engaged with peer feedback cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively over a semester of L2 writing and learning, and what factors influenced student engagement. Data were collected from peer feedback dialogue, multiple drafts of compositions, retrospective verbal reports, feedback notes, self-reflection, and focus groups. Data were analyzed through text analysis, content analysis, and thematic analysis. The findings revealed that student engagement with peer feedback varied over four writing tutorials. Face-to-face peer feedback contributed to maintaining sustainable student engagement with peer feedback. Other learner-related factors such as learner beliefs, language proficiency, product-oriented mindset, and context-related factors such as task requirements, feedback-related issues, and interaction patterns jointly influenced student engagement.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2023."
"Sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing text data and using language computation to extract valuable information, is a significant focus in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is widely used in various applications such as product review analysis, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring. This research investigates the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews from an e-commerce platform. A total of eight approaches have been presented in this study including LightGBM, SVM, KNN with bagging, MultinomialNB, DNN, LSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa. The performance for all the proposed models was compared using four evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The experimental results indicate that the SVM model has outperformed all the other methods with a testing accuracy of 73.98%. The F1-score, precision and recall are also the highest at 0.71, 0.72 and 0.70 respectively. This study contributes to the sentiment analysis literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of different models for sentiment analysis on customer reviews datasets.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Customer reviews often contain valuable feedback about a product or service, but it can be challenging to extract specific complaints and their underlying causes from the text. Despite the use of various methods to detect and analyze complaints, no studies have concentrated on thoroughly examining complaints at the aspect-level and the underlying reasons for such aspect-level complaints. We add the rationale annotation for the aspect-based complaint classes in a publicly available benchmark multimodal complaint dataset (CESAMARD), which spans five domains (books, electronics, edibles, fashion, and miscellaneous). Current multimodal complaint detection methods treat these tasks as classification problems and do not utilize external knowledge. The present study aims to tackle these concerns. We propose a knowledge-infused unified Multimodal Generative framework for Aspect-based complaint and Cause detection (MuGACD) by reframing the multitasking problem as a multimodal text-to-text generation task. Our proposed methodology established a benchmark performance in the novel aspect-based complaint and cause detection task based on extensive evaluation. We also demonstrated that our model consistently outperformed all other baselines and state-of-the-art models in both full and few-shot settings (The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Raghav10j/ECML23 ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"With the similarity between music and speech synthesis from symbolic input and the rapid development of text-to-speech (TTS) techniques, it is worthwhile to explore ways to improve the MIDI-to-audio performance by borrowing from TTS techniques.

"This paper explores the effectiveness of model-generated signals in improving zero-shot generalization of text-to-text Transformers such as T5. We study various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METROT0, which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies and then prompt-finetuned on a mixture of NLP tasks. METRO-T0 outperforms all similar-sized baselines on prompted NLP benchmarks, such as T0 Eval and MMLU, and rivals the state-of-the-art T011B model with only 8% of its parameters. Our analysis on model's neural activation and parameter sensitivity reveals that the effectiveness of METRO-T0 stems from more balanced contribution of parameters and better utilization of their capacity.

"We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification. We formulate text classification as a neural text matching problem where each document is treated as a query, and the system learns the mapping from each query to the relevant class labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label matching, and (2) using retrieved labels to enrich the training set in a self-training loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled data, which is close to the fully-supervised result. Extensive experiments and analyses show all the components of PESCO are necessary for improving the performance of zero-shot text classification. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The paper presents a comprehensive approach analysis on the lexicon of dialect speakers, chosen for the purpose of ethnolinguistic study of this research object. Attaining the objectives set contributes to the consideration of the problems relevant to the modern paradigm of scientific knowledge. Following the established methodological principles of linguistic units interpretation and using the recordings of the Don and Ukrainian dialects speakers as research material, the authors present a multilevel classification of a vast array of facts registered while surveying the informants in the residential areas with mixed population in the Volgograd region. The methods of differentiation of the vocabulary with an explicitly or implicitly expressed ethnocomponent of meaning are proposed, the means of linguistic continuum segmentation are determined. It is noted to reflect indirectly the realia, phenomena, processes and signs characteristic of traditional material and spiritual folk culture. The methodological system of dialectological, functional-and-semantic, and ethnolinguistic analysis of lexical units is introduced. It allows to present the person’s ethnic identification means in the speech of Russian and Ukrainian speakers, taking into account the content-and-semantic principle of detailing information in the text (within the framework of themes and microthemes) and the semantic-and-categorial method of ethnocultural meanings verbalization in the context (within situations and microsituations). The fundamentals of the field modelling technique embracing a vast array of facts are characterised, their application enables presenting lexicon of dialect speakers as the hierarchical structure, and the ethnolinguistic significance of its individual segments and their components identification is discovered. © 2023, Volgograd State University.

"The comprehensive study of the title of the novel “Crime and Punishment” by F.M. Dostoevsky as a source of precedence in the texts of Russian media is presented. The relevance of the research is determined by the need to study fiction as a valuable source of precedence in modern media discourse. Manipulative nature of modern media implies the expansion of the spheres-sources of precedence, appealing to the cultural background of the Russian linguistic culture bearers. The authors prove that the formation of the actual media space is based on a wide set of connotatively marked linguistic means, used as a tool to influence the potential reader. On the example of the precedent construction “Crime and Punishment”, appealing to the title of the famous novel by F.M. Dostoevsky, semantic-pragmatic and transformational features of precedent constructions and the specificity of their associative potential in the perception and interpretation in the Russian linguistic culture are illustrated. The research material includes texts of electronic media covering international, state, and regional issues and problems from 2017 to 2022. The research results are ensured by a wide repertoire of publications reflecting various aspects of society and state development. The card index included contexts (corpus of 120 examples), objectifying important social, economic, and political problems for modern society. The component and contextual analysis, distributive method, linguistic modeling were applied. Further study of the precedent phenomena appealing to fiction could present a valuable fragment of the media picture of the world, including the corpus of texts significant for the Russian linguistic culture. © Chudinov A.P., Segal N.А., 2023."
"To reveal the typical features of text duplication in papers from four medical fields: basic medicine, health management, pharmacology and pharmacy, and public health and preventive medicine. To analyze the reasons for duplication and provide suggestions for the management of medical academic misconduct. In total, 2,469 representative Chinese journal papers were included in our research, which were submitted by researchers in 2020 and 2021. A plagiarism check was carried out using the Academic Misconduct Literature Check System (AMLC). We generated a corrected similarity index based on the AMLC general similarity index for further analysis. We compared the similarity indices of papers in four medical fields and revealed their trends over time; differences in similarity index between review and research articles were also analyzed according to the different fields. Further analysis of 143 papers suspected of plagiarism was also performed from the perspective of sections containing duplication and according to the field of research. Papers in the field of pharmacology and pharmacy had the highest similarity index (8.67 ± 5.92%), which was significantly higher than that in other fields, except health management. The similarity index of review articles (9.77 ± 10.28%) was significantly higher than that of research articles (7.41 ± 6.26%). In total, 143 papers were suspected of plagiarism (5.80%) with similarity indices ≥ 15%; most were papers on health management (78, 54.55%), followed by public health and preventive medicine (38, 26.58%); 90.21% of the 143 papers had duplication in multiple sections, while only 9.79% had duplication in a single section. The distribution of sections with duplication varied among different fields; papers in pharmacology and pharmacy were more likely to have duplication in the data/methods and introduction/background sections, however, papers in health management were more likely to contain duplication in the introduction/background or results/discussion sections. Different structures for papers in different fields may have caused these differences. There were three limitations to our research. Firstly, we observed that a small number of papers have been checked early. It is unknown who conducted the plagiarism check as this can be included in other evaluations, such as applications for Science and technology projects or awards. If the authors carried out the check, text with high similarity indices may have been excluded before submission, meaning the similarity index in our research may have been lower than the original value. Secondly, there were only four medical fields included in our research. Additional analysis on a wider scale is required in the future. Thirdly, only a general similarity index was calculated in our study; other similarity indices were not tested. A comprehensive analysis of similarity indices in four medical fields was performed. We made several recommendations for the supervision of medical academic misconduct and the formation of criteria for defining suspected plagiarism for medical papers, as well as for the improved accuracy of text duplication checks. We quantified the differences between the AMLC general similarity index and the corrected index, described the situation around text duplication and plagiarism in papers from four medical fields, and revealed differences in similarity indices between different article types. We also revealed differences in the sections containing duplication for papers with suspected plagiarism among different fields.  © 2023 Md. Reazuddin Repon et al., published by Sciendo 2023."
"In this study, we analyze automatic evaluation metrics for Natural Language Generation (NLG), specifically task-agnostic metrics and human-aligned metrics. Task-agnostic metrics, such as Perplexity, BLEU, BERTScore, are cost-effective and highly adaptable to diverse NLG tasks, yet they have a weak correlation with human. Human-aligned metrics (CTC, CtrlEval, UniEval) improves correlation level by incorporating desirable human-like qualities as training objective. However, their effectiveness at discerning system-level performance and quality of system outputs remain unclear. We present metric preference checklist as a framework to assess the effectiveness of automatic metrics in three NLG tasks: Text Summarization, Dialogue Response Generation, and Controlled Generation. Our proposed framework provides access: (i) for verifying whether automatic metrics are faithful to human preference, regardless of their correlation level to human; and (ii) for inspecting the strengths and limitations of NLG systems via pairwise evaluation. We show that automatic metrics provide a better guidance than human on discriminating system-level performance in Text Summarization and Controlled Generation tasks. We also show that multi-aspect human-aligned metric (UniEval) is not necessarily dominant over single-aspect human-aligned metrics (CTC, CtrlEval) and task-agnostic metrics (BLEU, BERTScore), particularly in Controlled Generation tasks. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are expanding day by day virtual assistant bots, also known as chatbots are one of the many new technologies that will continue to touch our daily lives. A healthy lifestyle depends heavily on proper healthcare. Nevertheless, it might be exceedingly challenging to schedule a doctor’s appointment for every health issue. The goal is to develop a medical chatbot utilizing artificial intelligence that can diagnose the disease and provide precaution about it. It helps you to reduce the healthcare cost, also saves your time, and improves accessibility to medical knowledge. In recent years, numerous businesses and organizations have partnered with hospitals to offer assistance that can help doctors and medical personnels deal with patients better and expend less energy thanks to technology, chatbots have a lot of potential to transform the healthcare sector. With the aid of a text diagnosis bot, patients can participate in drug reviews and give a unique analysis report based on their symptoms. People will therefore be aware of their health and be properly protected. Certain chatbots serve as medical encyclopedias, educating patients about their conditions and promoting better health. A chatbot based on Sklearn is where you can give a symptom and it will ask you questions and will tell you the details and give some advice. This research study utilized “train test split” (split arrays into random train and test subsets) and “cross Val score” (evaluate a score by cross-validation) modules from Sklearn, Sklearn SVC (support vector classification). In this paper, authors have trained our model based on given data we gathered from the Internet (check data folder) and used Sklearn decision tree classifier (DTC). In multi-label classification, this is the subset accuracy which is a harsh metric since you require for each sample that each label set is correctly predicted. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
"With the increasing use of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, and Prime Video, a movie recommender system is an important tool for service providers and customers. However, there is no specific recommendation system for Indonesian films. Our research aims to improve the performance of the Indonesian film recommendation system with text analysis and feature importance. The first step is to get the Internet movie database (IMDb) Indonesian Movies dataset from Kaggle. We then conduct a text analysis that utilizes several stages, one of which is the bag of words (BoW) process. We apply feature importance to re-optimize the dataset. The following step compares three state-of-the-art classification models, SVM, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression, in predicting the Indonesian movie recommendation system. The metric we use to measure the performance of each model is the accuracy obtained by the cross-validation method. The test results show that out of 12 scenarios involving text analysis, feature Importance, and three prediction models for movie recommendation systems, the model with the best performance is naïve Bayes using text analysis and feature importance. The accuracy is 0.87 using K-fold cross-validation, with K utilized at 10.  © 2023 IEEE."
"There are three problems existing in the popular data-to-text datasets. First, the large-scale datasets either contain noise or lack real application scenarios. Second, the datasets close to real applications are relatively small in size. Last, current datasets bias in the English language while leaving other languages underexplored. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we present CATS, a pragmatic Chinese answer-to-sequence dataset with large scale and high quality. The dataset aims to generate textual descriptions for the answer in the practical TableQA system. Further, to bridge the structural gap between the input SQL and table and establish better semantic alignments, we propose a Unified Graph Transformation approach to establish a joint encoding space for the two hybrid knowledge resources and convert this task to a graph-to-text problem. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further analysis on CATS attests to both the high quality and challenges of the dataset. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In-context learning (ICL) unfolds as large language models become capable of inferring test labels conditioned on a few labeled samples without any gradient update. ICL-enabled large language models provide a promising step forward toward bypassing recurrent annotation costs in a low-resource setting. Yet, only a handful of past studies have explored ICL in a cross-lingual setting, in which the need for transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap, we provide the first in-depth analysis of ICL for cross-lingual text classification. We find that the prevalent mode of selecting random input-label pairs to construct the prompt-context is severely limited in the case of cross-lingual ICL, primarily due to the lack of alignment in the input as well as the output spaces. To mitigate this, we propose a novel prompt construction strategy - Cross-lingual In-context Source-Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an injected coherence in the semantics of the input examples and a task-based alignment across the source and target languages, X-InSTA is able to outperform random prompt selection by a large margin across three different tasks using 44 different cross-lingual pairs. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"At the end of the year 2021, the iiidependent publishing house Amor de Madre published the first edition of Carcoma, the first novel by Layla Martinez and a rarity within the panorama of current Spanish narrative: a short novel, published by a small publishing house and with very short print runs, which narrated a sort of Iberian Gothic tale. The peculiarity of this story lavs, in the one hand, in the simplicity of its starting point and, on the other, in the brutality of its enunciation: two narrators who speak directly to the reader, almost mutually stealing each other's stage, as if they had invited them to spend the afternoon in the dining room of that house to tell him the terrible storv it holds. The appearance of Carcoma is framed within a context of a profound transformation in the ways of perceiving and narrating the past that, from literary discourse, accompanies the very transformation of the memorial framework that has been ongoing in the Spanish context since the early 2000s and that has ultimately taken shape through an indissoluble link to the changes in collective concerns and ways of telling that involved the socio-economic transformations following the crisis cycle of 2008-2012 in Spain. Assuming that there is already a consensual cultural discourse, especially in relation to the memory of Franco's repression, which is based on what we could call a memorial orthodoxy, this paper approaches the analysis of Layla Martinez's novel as an exercise in symbolic reparation that, through the fictionalization of revenge, delves into the performative dimension of a narrative text that seeks the reader's catharsis. © 2023 Padova University Press.

"Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic generative models that have been widely used as a prior for image processing tasks like text conditional generation and inpainting. We demonstrate that these models can be adapted to make predictions and provide uncertainty quantification for chaotic dynamical systems. In these applications, diffusion models can implicitly represent knowledge about outliers and extreme events; however, querying that knowledge through conditional sampling or measuring probabilities is surprisingly difficult. Existing methods for conditional sampling at inference time seek mainly to enforce the constraints, which is insufficient to match the statistics of the distribution or compute the probability of the chosen events. To achieve these ends, optimally one would use the conditional score function, but its computation is typically intractable. In this work, we develop a probabilistic approximation scheme for the conditional score function which provably converges to the true distribution as the noise level decreases. With this scheme we are able to sample conditionally on nonlinear user-defined events at inference time, and matches data statistics even when sampling from the tails of the distribution. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

"An event is defined by the attributes who, what, where, when, and how, and an event tweet usually contains these basic aspects. Real-time events are events happening presently or happened a short time back. Social media is a way to associate different types of interrelated domains. The biggest social media platforms are YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Social networking is a platform that allows people from similar background or with similar interest to connect online. The objective of event detection is to predict the local and the global event that happened. Events constrained by time and geography, those that occurred in the nearby areas are analyzed by local event detection. Contrarily, global event detection identifies events that have a greater worldwide impact, such as COVID, wars. Social media event detection is a tool for content analysis in which the processes automatically detect the topic present in text and reveal the hidden pattern in the corpus. The major goal is to provide a thorough summary of current revelations in the area, aiding the reader in comprehending the primary issues covered thus far and suggesting potential directions for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"The article focuses on the dramatic work of the Slovak writer Jana Bodnárová (b. 1950) in the intersections of feminist tendencies and “women’s writing” as conceptualised by Hélène Cixous in her manifesto The Laugh of the Medusa (1976). The paper analyses the plays J. Bodnárová wrote after 1989. Thematically, these concentrate mainly on violence and cruelty against women in various forms. J. Bodnárová depicts women’s experience in relation to the theme of physicality. She interprets the female body as lived and experienced, capable of constantly reshaping its boundaries and unmasking its inner movements. In Bodnárová’s texts, the body is a constructive tool through which the author can approach the misogynistic thinking that encloses women in their bodies. In the context of the phenomenon of “women’s writing,” the theme of empowering women’s “voice” on the basis of artistic creation comes to the fore. Affinities are present with Hélène Cixous’s drama Portrait de Dora (1976, second revised edition 1986) which focuses on the motif of the forms of sexual abuse and trauma women experience that are the results of society’s patriarchal character. © 2023, Institute of Slovak Literature SAS.

"Dating Greek papyri accurately is crucial not only to edit their texts but also to understand numerous other aspects of ancient writing, document and book production and circulation, as well as various other aspects of administration, everyday life and intellectual history of antiquity. Although a substantial number of Greek papyri documents bear a date or other conclusive data as to their chronological placement, an even larger number can only be dated tentatively or in approximation, due to the lack of decisive evidence. By creating a dataset of 389 transcriptions of documentary Greek papyri, we train 389 regression models and we predict a date for the papyri with an average MAE of 54 years and an MSE of 1.17, outperforming image classifiers and other baselines. Last, we release date estimations for 159 manuscripts, for which only the upper limit is known. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Large language models show impressive results at predicting structured text such as code, but also commonly introduce errors and hallucinations in their output. When used to assist software developers, these models may make mistakes that users must go back and fix, or worse, introduce subtle bugs that users may miss entirely. We propose Randomized Utility-driven Synthesis of Uncertain REgions (R-U-SURE), an approach for building uncertainty-aware suggestions based on a decision-theoretic model of goal-conditioned utility, using random samples from a generative model as a proxy for the unobserved possible intents of the end user. Our technique combines minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams in order to efficiently produce structured uncertainty summaries, given only sample access to an arbitrary generative model of code and an optional AST parser. We demonstrate R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied different user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines. We also release our implementation as an open-source library at https://github.com/google-research/r_u_sure. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research. All rights reserved."
"Automating Cross-lingual Science Journalism (CSJ) aims to generate popular science summaries from English scientific texts for non-expert readers in their local language. We introduce CSJ as a downstream task of text simplification and cross-lingual scientific summarization to facilitate science journalists' work. We analyze the performance of possible existing solutions as baselines for the CSJ task. Based on these findings, we propose to combine the three components - SELECT, SIMPLIFY and REWRITE (SSR) to produce cross-lingual simplified science summaries for non-expert readers. Our empirical evaluation on the WIKIPEDIA dataset shows that SSR significantly outperforms the baselines for the CSJ task and can serve as a strong baseline for future work. We also perform an ablation study investigating the impact of individual components of SSR. Further, we analyze the performance of SSR on a high-quality, real-world CSJ dataset with human evaluation and in-depth analysis, demonstrating the superior performance of SSR for CSJ. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Background: In military settings, determining whether a patient with abdominal pain requires emergency care can be challenging due to the absence or inexperience of medical staff. Misjudging the severity of abdominal pain can lead to delayed treatment or unnecessary transfers, both of which consume valuable resources. Therefore, our aim was to develop an artificial intelligence model capable of classifying the urgency of abdominal pain cases, taking into account patient characteristics. Methods: We collected structured and unstructured data from patients with abdominal pain visiting South Korean military hospital emergency rooms between January 2015 and 2020. After excluding patients with missing values, 20,432 patients were enrolled. Structured data consisted of age, sex, vital signs, past medical history, and symptoms, while unstructured data included preprocessed free text descriptions of chief complaints and present illness. Patients were divided into training, validation, and test datasets in an 8:1:1 ratio. Using structured data, we developed four conventional machine learning models and a novel mixed model, which combined one of the best performing machine learning models with emergency medical knowledge. And we also created a deep learning model using both structured and unstructured data. Results: Xgboost demonstrated the highest performance among the six models, with an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) score of 0.61. The other five models achieved AUPRC scores as follows: logistic regression (0.24), decision tree (0.22), multi-layer perceptron (0.21), deep neural network (0.58), and mixed model (0.58). Conclusion: This study is the first to develop an AI model for identifying emergency cases of abdominal pain in a military setting. With more balanced and better-structured datasets, clinically significant AI model could be developed based on the findings of this study. © 2023"
"Large-scale pre-trained language models have shown outstanding performance in a variety of NLP tasks. However, they are also known to be significantly brittle against specifically crafted adversarial examples, leading to increasing interest in probing the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. We introduce RSMI, a novel two-stage framework that combines randomized smoothing (RS) with masked inference (MI) to improve the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. RS transforms a classifier into a smoothed classifier to obtain robust representations, whereas MI forces a model to exploit the surrounding context of a masked token in an input sequence. RSMI improves adversarial robustness by 2 to 3 times over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We also perform in-depth qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of the different stages of RSMI and probe the impact of its components through extensive ablations. By empirically proving the stability of RSMI, we put it forward as a practical method to robustly train large-scale NLP models.

"The article presents the literary texts of the author of Szklarka Waterfall and the main themes of his work and biography related to these mountains. The author of the article discusses the post-war experiences and poems of Różewicz, as well as his late works devoted to the Karkonosze Mountains, written at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. The purpose of this analysis is a historical and regional reconstruction of the poetics of his works, which are a dialogue with the topography, the past, and the material and symbolic heritage of the Sudeten and their Foothills. The analysis in the article is accompanied by the following questions: What relations connected Różewicz’s literary work on the Sudeten and his biography with the process of their Polonization? Which of the crucial elements of the history, tradition and cultural heritage of these mountains did the writer include in his works? The author of the article primarily uses geocriticism, combining it with the history and so-called new regionalism. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the integral creative presence of Różewicz in the Sudeten consisted in a conscious, created by the poet, connection of his writing and biography with the environment, culture and social life of the region. © The Author(s), 2023."
"Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform analysis of various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate some insights into the standard parametric LM, improving performance without the need for an explicit retrieval component.

"OBJECTIVES: Abbreviations are often used in medicine yet may be a source of confusion for patients and their families. We aimed to determine the general public's understanding of commonly used medical acronyms. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we surveyed state fair visitors regarding their understanding of 5 common medical acronyms. An electronic survey was administered to a volunteer sample of adults who spoke and read English and who had never trained to work in medicine or nursing. Free-text responses were coded as correct, partially correct, or incorrect by 2 independent researchers, adding a third researcher if consensus was not reached. Analysis methods included descriptive statistics, Fisher exact tests, and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: We recruited 204 volunteers (55% female; mean age 43 years; 67% had a bachelor's degree or higher). ED (emergency department) was correctly defined by 32%, PCP (primary care provider/physician) by 18%, CBC (complete blood count) by 14%, and PRN (as needed) and NPO (nothing by mouth) by 13% each. Female gender was associated with higher odds of correctly understanding NPO (odds ratio, 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.21; P 5.02); older age was associated with higher odds of understanding PRN (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.05; P 5.04). Education level was not found to correlate significantly with successful explanation of any tested acronym. CONCLUSIONS: Medical acronyms are a predictable source of miscommunication. In this large cross-sectional study, none of the acronyms evaluated was understood correctly by more than one-third of adults. Clinicians should avoid using acronyms with patients and families to minimize confusion. Copyright © 2023 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."
"Objectives: To determine the scope of the application of natural language processing to free-text clinical notes in post-acute care and provide a foundation for future natural language processing–based research in these settings. Design: Scoping review; reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Setting and Participants: Post-acute care (ie, home health care, long-term care, skilled nursing facilities, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities). Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Embase were searched in February 2023. Eligible studies had quantitative designs that used natural language processing applied to clinical documentation in post-acute care settings. The quality of each study was appraised. Results: Twenty-one studies were included. Almost all studies were conducted in home health care settings. Most studies extracted data from electronic health records to examine the risk for negative outcomes, including acute care utilization, medication errors, and suicide mortality. About half of the studies did not report age, sex, race, or ethnicity data or use standardized terminologies. Only 8 studies included variables from socio-behavioral domains. Most studies fulfilled all quality appraisal indicators. Conclusions and Implications: The application of natural language processing is nascent in post-acute care settings. Future research should apply natural language processing using standardized terminologies to leverage free-text clinical notes in post-acute care to promote timely, comprehensive, and equitable care. Natural language processing could be integrated with predictive models to help identify patients who are at risk of negative outcomes. Future research should incorporate socio-behavioral determinants and diverse samples to improve health equity in informatics tools. © 2023 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine"
"Social media is one of the most highly sought resources for analyzing characteristics of the language by its users. In particular, many researchers utilized various linguistic features of mental health problems from social media. However, existing approaches to detecting mental disorders face critical challenges, such as the scarcity of high-quality data or the trade-off between addressing the complexity of models and presenting interpretable results grounded in expert domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we design a simple but flexible model that preserves domain-based interpretability. We propose a novel approach that captures the semantic meanings directly from the text and compares them to symptom-related descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms relevant baselines on various mental disorder detection tasks. Our detailed analysis shows that the proposed model is effective at leveraging domain knowledge, transferable to other mental disorders, and providing interpretable detection results. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"The article compares the travelogues of Jozef Miloslav Hurban (1817-1888) with those written by Terézia Vansová (1857-1942). The author treats the texts as examples of (1) the romantic national revivalist travelogue with an ideological (national) focus (Hurban’s travelogues Cesta Slováka k bratrům slavenským na Moravě a v Čechách 1839 [The journey of a Slovak to his Slavic brothers in Moravia and Bohemia 1839], 1841; Prechádzka po považskom svete [A walk in the world of Považie], 1844) and (2) its later, programmatically much sober and down to earth variation associated with the woman’s viewpoint and entertainment function (Vansová’s prose Pani Georgiadesová na cestách. Veselý cestopis do Prahy na národopisnú výstavu [Mrs Georgiadesová on the road. A cheerful travelogue to Prague to an ethnographic exhibition], 1896-1897). The core of the analysis is the representation of space and the nature of movement in space. While in the Romantic travelogues, there is a tendency to highlight the immaterial spiritual principle of space and to “tone down” the physicality of the traveller himself, in Vansová’s work, the body of the characters (their hunger, thirst, and fatigue) comes intentionally to the fore and clashes with the “higher” (mostly national revivalist) motives and ideals, without, however, denying them. It is a practice that is typologically very close to the strategies of post-Romantic authors who sought to break away from the poetics of the Romantics and their epigones. © 2023, Institute of Slovak Literature SAS.

"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on healthcare systems worldwide. In particular, long-term care facilities have proved more susceptible to infection as they care for vulnerable populations at high risk of chronic illness. How this impacts the role and core competencies of health and care workers in these facilities remains less understood. Aim: Describe how health and care workers contribute to the prevention of emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities. Design: A scoping review. Methods: A systematic search of literature dating from 2002 to 2022 was conducted in the following databases: EMBASE, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Web of Science, and AgeLine. Studies were selected if they focused on health and care workers in long-term care facilities, offered a perspective on the prevention of emerging infectious diseases or infection prevention and control, and were original qualitative or quantitative studies in English. Data were extracted, cross-checked and analyzed by two researchers, and any difference in views regarding the appropriateness of literature would be resolved by consulting a third researcher. An inductive descriptive approach was applied for the analysis of results, and themes were established via consensus meetings. Results: A total of fourteen studies from Asia, Europe, and the Americas were included. Three themes emerged from the review: “The roles of health and care workers evolve with the times”, “The core competencies of health and care workers are essential for preventing emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities” and “The key to successful prevention of emerging infectious diseases in long-term care facilities is through a systematic, comprehensive effort that mobilize health and care workers at all levels”. Health and care workers had to take on increasingly complex roles and rely on their core competencies to cope with epidemic changes, and facility resources, employee quality and management models were found to have significantly improved infection prevention and control outcomes. Conclusions: The roles of health and care workers are evolving, and effective infection prevention within long-term care facilities depends on their ability to perform core competencies with skill and confidence. Moreover, a systematic, comprehensive framework, for which this paper proposes three guidelines, is urgently needed to ensure consistent policy implementation within the facility as well as support and access to resources for health and care workers. Clinical Relevance: Infection prevention efforts within long-term care facilities must take into account the evolving roles of health and care workers, with a focus on guaranteeing access to resources, training and support that will help them gain the core competencies necessary for juggling those roles. In addition, there is an urgent need for research instruments that will help assess those competencies and identify areas of improvement. © 2023 Sigma Theta Tau International."
"This article investigates selected environmental informational picturebooks in which – often in both the main text and the peritext – readers find brief descriptions of actions they can take to change their habits and save the planet. The analysis focuses on lists of tasks incorporated into books and considers whether such sections (and, potentially, whole books) invite critical engagement. This ability seems crucial in times of fake news and the need for conscious action and political engagement in climate issues. In the first part, the theoretical framework on informational picturebooks is presented, and the importance of peritextual elements is stressed, as well as the critical thinking that may be fostered by a nonfiction text, referring to Joe Sutliff Sanders’ concept of “a literature of questions” (date?). Four international picturebooks are then discussed, representing both ‘traditional’ (Müll by Gerda Raidt and Śmieciogród by Ola Woldańska-Płocińska) and ‘new’ children’s nonfiction (Be a Tree! by Maria Gianferrari and Felicita Sala and Greta and the Giants by Zoë Tucker and Zoe Persico). The analysis demonstrates that green informational picturebooks may be perceived as both eco-activist books and books about eco-activism as they present certain tasks and encourage the readers to take actions; hence, the term “a literature of actions” has been proposed, as these books seem to trigger little critical thinking. The reason green informational picturebooks are unlikely to foster critical engagement may be that fighting the climate crisis is crucial to ensure humanity’s future wellbeing. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Purpose: Financial stability has become a focal point for central banks since the global financial crisis. However, the optimal mix between monetary and financial stability policies remains unclear. In this study, the “soft” approach to such policy mix was tested – how often monetary policy (in inflation reports) analyses financial stability issues. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned objective. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 648 inflation reports published by 11 central banks from post-communist countries in 1998-2019 were reviewed using a text-mining method. Findings: Results show that financial stability topics (mainly cyclical aspects of systemic risk) on average account for only 2%of inflation reports’ content. Although this share has grown somewhat since the global financial crisis (in CZ, HU and PL), it still remains at a low level. Thus, not enough evidence was found on the use of a “soft” policy mix in post-communist countries. Practical implications: Given the strong interactions between price and financial stability, this paper emphasizes the need to increase the attention of monetary policymakers to financial stability issues. Originality/value: The study combines two research areas, i.e. monetary policy and modern text mining techniques on a sample of post-communist countries, something which to the best of the authors’ knowledge has not been sufficiently explored in the literature before. © 2023, Łukasz Kurowski and Paweł Smaga."
"Requirements include the core functionalities of the software, however, due to their typical representations in natural language, professionals invest considerable effort in modeling to achieve more precise, coherent, and verifiable requirements analysis. This paper proposes a method called NL2PD for Problem Frames approach to extract requirements entities and relationships from requirements texts described in natural language and generate a problem diagrams to assist software requirements analysis. Given a requirements document in natural language, we can automatically extract required information and generate problem diagrams, on top of which users can edit, import and export. The method was tested with common requirements formats, demonstrating its ability to streamline the process of constructing problem diagrams from requirements.

"In recent years, ship collision accidents have been widely concerned due to their high frequency of occurrence and serious losses. However, the analysis of the accident cause, especially the human factors, often lacks the corresponding data support. Therefore, this paper introduces the grounded theory (GT) to conduct the text mining of the accident report, aiming at taking accident as a reference to find out the causes of the ship collision accidents, and obtain the structured framework, identify and evaluate key factors through structural and quantitative methods. Secondly, by comparing HFACS-MA and HFACS-COLL, HFACS-COLL is improved and the results are structured to construct a HFACS framework for ship collision accidents. Finally, the statistical analysis method is used to analyze the correlation and accident-causing factors at all levels. The results show that the causal factors in ship collisions can be represented by a top-down, coarse-grained to fine-grained multi-layered HFACS hierarchy and there are correlations between external factors, organizational influences, unsafe supervision, preconditions for unsafe acts, and unsafe acts. External factors are the potential cause of ship collision accidents and the potential inducement of organizational influences. Negative organizational influences will lead to the genesis of unsafe supervision, form the preconditions of unsafe acts, and eventually lead to the occurrence of unsafe acts. To conclude, the HFACS framework of stand-on vessels and give-way vessels in ship collision accidents was obtained by GT text mining respectively. Combined with WBA and statistical analysis methods, the causes of accidents and the correlation between factors were excavated.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The internet's current development has become one factor that gives social media users opportunities to leave comments and posts containing hate speech. Detecting hate speech on social media, particularly on Twitter, has recently become a widely researched topic. Research that has been conducted usually applies a standard machine learning approach. The deep learning approach has become popular because it provides better and more effective results. However, it's still rare to be applied to detect hate speech in Indonesian language texts. This research shows the results of a performance comparison from the deep learning approach using CNN, LSTM, and CNN+LSTM architecture models for detecting hate speech in tweets using the Indonesian language. The dataset used is divided into a general dataset which is the entire dataset and a specific topic dataset that deals with the topic of government, which was taken from the general dataset. The research shows better results when the CNN architecture model is implemented on Indonesian language tweet data compared to the results obtained from the LSTM architecture model and the combination of CNN+LSTM with accuracy and F1-score reaching 81%. Furthermore, the implementation of deep learning models in detecting hate speech performs better than previous research using the same dataset but applying machine learning models with feature extraction. This research also shows that specific data discussing a particular topic significantly impact the model's performance. Thus the version of the model becomes better when applied to data with a general topic and a more extensive vocabulary.  © 2023 IEEE."
"The search engine is designed to crawl and index web pages, and then use advanced algorithms to analyze the content of these pages and determine their relevance to specific search queries. In this project, we present the development of an optimized search engine that aims to provide efficient and accurate search results for users. We have implemented various optimization techniques to improve the performance of the search engine, including efficient data structures for indexing, query processing, and result ranking. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed search engine achieves significant improvements in search efficiency and accuracy compared to existing search engines. A search engine is a very useful and effective instrument for obtaining any sort of information from the Internet. Search engine helps all types of users to immediately find relevant information. But the present design of search engines has led us to the semantic web design. After implementing the semantic web, the search engines should be more efficient and useful for searching relevant and useful information. The proposed search engine can be used for various applications, such as information retrieval, e-commerce, and social media analysis. This paper presents the implementation and design structure of a semantic search engine named QUESTCLOUD. The search engine is developed to manage both image and text search, with a flexible architecture that will scale up. Each module is independent of others and therefore its efficiency can be improved without affecting the whole system. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023."
"Background and Objective: The conservation and rational management of forest reserves require preliminary studies of ecological and floristic characterization. It is for this reason that the present study on the woody vegetation of the forest reserve of Mayo-Oulo subjected to human activities was undertaken. The aim of this study was to evaluate its floristic composition, floristic diversity and woody stand structure. Materials and Methods: The experimental set-up is a split plot with the villages constituting the main treatments. Data were collected through floristic surveys in 36 plots of 100×100 m, counting individuals of size >1.8 m and measuring DBH at 1.30 m from the ground for trees made and were subject to analysis of variance and multifactor text. Floristic richness, diversity indices, structure and biological and phytogeographic types were determined. Results: This resulted in 2174 individuals divided into 29 species, 24 genera and 14 families with dominance of Fabaceae, Shannon’s diversity index ranged from 1.21 to 2.33 bits and Pielou's equitability from 0.41 to 0.79. The density is 60.38 ind haG1, the basal area is 2.62 m2 haG1 and vertical and horizontal structures are ""L"" shaped. Microphanerophytes (62.06%) and phytogeographic types dominate biological types by multi-regional and pantropical species. Conclusion: The results confirmed the poverty and low diversity of the reserve, which is evidence of the state of degradation and disturbance of the woody stratum of the studied formation. This constitutes basic data for the development of conservation strategies and sustainable management of forest resources. © 2023 Wassingsa Thomas et al."

"Purpose: Digital transformation and innovation-driven development have become an international consensus. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of relationships, mechanisms and economic consequences between digital transformation and enterprise innovation quality in order to provide a benchmark for developing countries to implement digital transformation strategies and innovation-driven strategies and provide a major support for economic recovery in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. Design/methodology/approach: Using microdata from A-share listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2021, this study examines the relationship between digital transformation and enterprise innovation quality and further reveals the internal logic and economic consequences of digital transformation to improve enterprise innovation quality through the mediating effect and moderating effect models. Findings: The results demonstrate that digital transformation is beneficial for improving enterprise innovation quality. The heterogeneity test demonstrates that digital transformation has a larger effect on improving enterprise innovation quality in non-state-owned enterprises and eastern enterprises in China. The mechanism test demonstrates that digital transformation can improve enterprise innovation quality by improving internal control quality and analyst attention. Furthermore, with the increase in enterprise innovation inputs, digital transformation plays a significantly stronger role in improving enterprise innovation quality. The extended analysis demonstrates that digital transformation can significantly improve enterprise financial performance by improving innovation quality. Research limitations/implications: First, the construction of the core explanatory variable digital transformation index in this study is based on the Python data analysis software, which calculates the frequency of digital transformation in the text of the business situation analysis portion of the annual report of the listed companies and then obtains the degree of digital transformation of the company in this year. There may be some deviation from the degree of digital transformation in the actual production and operation of enterprises. Second, in addition to internal control quality and analyst attention, are there other mediating mechanisms for the impact of digital transformation on the quality of enterprise innovation? Third, whether the moderating effect of innovation input on digital transformation and innovation quality is related to human capital factors of the research and development (R&D) team, such as the technical background of R&D personnel, etc. Originality/value: This study enriches the relevant theories of digital transformation and broadens the research boundaries of digital transformation and enterprise innovation.

"Rome is the city where the memory of Italian colonialism is more evident in the urban space. Nevertheless, this heritage is often neglected or forgotten, just like other traces of Italian colonialism in the national territory and culture. This period of Italian history has indeed never been properly elaborated by Italian culture and historiography, as critics have widely demonstrated. In this essay, traces of Italian colonialism in Rome will be investigated through the analysis of literary contributions produced over the last thirty years, and specifically of texts written by women writers, who proved to have a special perspective on colonialism and its effects on the capital. Novels, short stories, poems and autobiographies by Ubah Cristina Ali Farah, Shirin Ramzanali Fazel, Igiaba Scego and Ribka Sibhatu–and specifically the paths covered by their fictional characters in the urban space–will thus serve as guides to explore the city. The aim of the essay is to shed light on the present identity of Rome as a complex city and as the object of new narrations. From Stazione Termini to Quartiere Africano, passing through Piazza di Porta Capena, Piazzale Flaminio and other places, this essay remaps the urban space and questions Rome’s colonial heritage. As a result, it shows that displacing the traditional significance given to monuments, streets and squares in Rome means rediscussing Italian history and national identity. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Humans are storytellers, even in communication scenarios which are assumed to be more rationality-oriented, such as argumentation. Indeed, supporting arguments with narratives or personal experiences (henceforth, stories) is a very natural thing to do - and yet, this phenomenon is largely unexplored in computational argumentation. Which role do stories play in an argument? Do they make the argument more effective? What are their narrative properties? To address these questions, we collected and annotated StoryARG, a dataset sampled from well-established corpora in computational argumentation (ChangeMyView and RegulationRoom), and the Social Sciences (Europolis), as well as comments to New York Times articles. StoryARG contains 2451 textual spans annotated at two levels. At the argumentative level, we annotate the function of the story (e.g., clarification, disclosure of harm, search for a solution, establishing speaker's authority), as well as its impact on the effectiveness of the argument and its emotional load. At the level of narrative properties, we annotate whether the story has a plot-like development, is factual or hypothetical, and who the protagonist is. What makes a story effective in an argument? Our analysis of the annotations in StoryARG uncover a positive impact on effectiveness for stories which illustrate a solution to a problem, and in general, annotator-specific preferences that we investigate with regression analysis. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"Video multimodal fusion aims to integrate multimodal signals in videos, such as visual, audio and text, to make a complementary prediction with multiple modalities contents. However, unlike other image-text multimodal tasks, video has longer multimodal sequences with more redundancy and noise in both visual and audio modalities. Prior denoising methods like forget gate are coarse in the granularity of noise filtering. They often suppress the redundant and noisy information at the risk of losing critical information. Therefore, we propose a denoising bottleneck fusion (DBF) model for fine-grained video multimodal fusion. On the one hand, we employ a bottleneck mechanism to filter out noise and redundancy with a restrained receptive field. On the other hand, we use a mutual information maximization module to regulate the filter-out module to preserve key information within different modalities. Our DBF model achieves significant improvement over current state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmarks covering multimodal sentiment analysis and multimodal summarization tasks. It proves that our model can effectively capture salient features from noisy and redundant video, audio, and text inputs.

". The reflections and data presented and discussed in this text represent a portion of the conclusions after an investigation carried out in a master’s research, whose focus was on understanding the curriculum of the training course for chemistry teachers in effect since 2017/2 at UFRGS. The study reported in this article consists of the analysis of the responses obtained from undergraduates through the application of questionnaires. The emphasized issues concern the structure of the course, its disciplines, didactic procedures, teaching strategies, materials, evaluation forms and other aspects aimed at the contribution of specific, pedagogical, and articulating disciplines in the formation of chemical educators. The results indicate maintenance of a curricular matrix that favors academic content taught in the traditional way, but with the inclusion of disciplines characterized by future teachers as essential to the formation of their teaching identity, pedagogical autonomy, and professional development. In addition, there is a disparity between the didactic procedures followed in the different disciplines, which indicates aspects to be prioritized in future reconfigurations of the curricular matrix. © 2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

"Greek literary papyri, which are unique witnesses of antique literature, do not usually bear a date. They are thus currently dated based on palaeographical methods, with broad approximations which often span more than a century. We created a dataset of 242 images of papyri written in “bookhand” scripts whose date can be securely assigned, and we used it to train machine and deep learning algorithms for the task of dating, showing its challenging nature. To address the data scarcity problem, we extended our dataset by segmenting each image to the respective text lines. By using the line-based version of our dataset, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network, equipped with a fragmentation-based augmentation strategy, and we achieved a mean absolute error of 54 years. The results improve further when the task is cast as a multiclass classification problem, predicting the century. Using our network, we computed and provided precise date estimations for papyri whose date is disputed or vaguely defined and we undertake an explainability-based analysis to facilitate future attribution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Purpose: The study aimed at examining the lived experiences of relatives caring for family members with mental illness in Ghana. Methods: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was adopted to explore caregivers' in-depth experiences. Fifteen caregivers were purposefully selected from four hospitals within the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, and they were engaged in face-to-face interview sessions through the semi-structured guided interviews. Interviews were transcribed into text formats and analysed using the IPA approach. Results: Three superordinate themes and their respective sub-themes were identified. Theme 1: Being with the mentally ill (time consuming; financial burden; healer shopping); Theme 2: Psychosocial effect (stigmatization; stress and depression; changes in social/work life); Theme3: Coping resources (prayers/spirituality; psychological capital – ignoring, self-encouragement, acceptance, routinization; social/family support; reading). Conclusion: It was recommended that healthcare professionals ought to prepare family members for the emotional challenges by providing them with constant therapeutic service to help reduce their emotional strain associated with the burden of care. Public education should be intensified for people to understand the need for accepting people with mental illness in order to reduce the issue of stigmatization. Again, government should institute policies through its agencies (Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service) to assist the caregivers in the discharge of responsibilities. This could take the form of reducing cost of drugs, and establishing community mental health care to provide immediate support. © 2023 British Psychological Society."
"This study aims to promote the learning of phrasal verbs (PVs) of Vietnamese low-intermediate adult English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) learners. Thirty-one students were involved in the study over an eleven-week span. In this study we adopted an action research design with a four-stage procedure, including planning, acting, observing and reflecting. The planning stage starts with exploring how PVs are introduced in the textbooks through document analysis and investigating the students‟ current knowledge of PVs thorough diagnose text. The acting stage goes with implementing some measures to raise the students‟ awareness of the syntactic and semantic features of this lexico-grammatical area and to increase their uptake of PVs through both incidental and intentional learning. The observing phase works on systematically and continually evaluating the effectiveness of the action taken through regular, progressive tests and in-class discussion. The effectiveness of the treatment was measured with pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-tests in a form of gap filling multiple choice individual sentences. The final stage is reflecting - mirroring the gains and limitations of the teaching and testing techniques implemented. The results of this study reveal a constrained depiction of the PVs in certain aspects, echoing concerns highlighted in prior research. The findings propose that the integration of PV instruction into the comprehensive enhancement of language proficiency for A1-B1 proficiency levels, coupled with a targeted cognitive approach to PVs at the A2-B1 levels, can result in enhanced, enduring retention of PV knowledge. This study deliberates on pragmatic implications for the efficacious advancement of EFL learners' comprehension and utilization of PVs. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved."
"COVID-19 has forced HEIs to rethink instructional methodologies. In emergencies, colleges substituted information for face-to-face education. Mobile information is a teaching technique with several educational tools. This content analysis aims to classify: 1) explore subjects; 2) applicable hypotheses; 3) most scrutinised methodologies; 4) methods of investigation. The PRISMA results were observed inside this case, and various techniques for text classification and textual analysis were used. The literature was chosen from three journals of first-quartile specialising in educational technology that were indexed in JCR-SSCI. The final sample consisted of 248 papers. Three key nodes emerged from the text analysis: 1) virtual students; 2) digital instructors; 3) instructional practices with a program. The most-studied information medium is MOOCs. Innovative acceptance model and context of interest were most widely employed hypotheses. Case studies were most popular. Finally, we present our SRL's aims. The study focuses on the most explored information modality, essential e-learning theoretical structures, and research methodology typologies. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"We present EPIC (English Perspectivist Irony Corpus), the first annotated corpus for irony analysis based on the principles of data perspectivism. The corpus contains short conversations from social media in five regional varieties of English, and it is annotated by contributors from five countries corresponding to those varieties. We analyse the resource along the perspectives induced by the diversity of the annotators, in terms of origin, age, and gender, and the relationship between these dimensions, irony, and the topics of conversation. We validate EPIC by creating perspective-aware models that encode the perspectives of annotators grouped according to their demographic characteristics. Firstly, the performance of perspectivist models confirms that different annotators induce very different models. Secondly, in the classification of ironic and non-ironic texts, perspectivist models prove to be generally more confident than the non-perspectivist ones. Furthermore, comparing the performance on a perspective-based test set with those achieved on a gold standard test set, we can observe how perspectivist models tend to detect more precisely the positive class, showing their ability to capture the different perceptions of irony. Thanks to these models, we are moreover able to show interesting insights about the variation in the perception of irony by the different groups of annotators, such as among different generations and nationalities. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"In the past decade, the availability of voluminous and high-dimensional datasets has immensely emerged with continuous technological innovations to foster new ways to gather and analyze data. Thus, feature selection has become a challenging task in areas of application like text classification, data analysis, prediction, information retrieval etc. Knowledge extraction using machine learning models usually depends on the quality and quantity of data that they operate on. Feature selection is one of the core concepts to identify and remove irrelevant as well as redundant information that may impact accuracy or have no impact on the results. Feature selection methods are discussed in this review paper along with practical limitations. Subsequently, the workflow to solve a feature selection problem is also elaborated with feature selection methods. In feature selection, many surveys and empirical assessments were performed in many areas like classification, prediction, regression, and clustering, respectively. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023."
"Power losses and voltage profiles in electricity distribution networks are a problem, particularly in developing nations. Many techniques have reportedly been used in the previous ten years to address this issue. Among other solutions, network reconfigurations (NRs) are regarded as one of the most practical. It is important to conduct a periodic update survey on this subject because the electricity radial distribution networks (RDNs) are continually evolving. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of the various techniques to address the issues with NRs along distribution networks is provided in this manuscript. There is discussion of several mathematical, traditional, heuristic-based, and machine-learning strategies. It is important to understand how the radiality is achieved as well as methods for resolving distribution load flow, particularly with greater R/X ratios. The most typical test cases used in the literature are listed. In order to enrich this review and make it useful to others, more than 200 articles (the majority of which were published in the last five years) are referenced inside the body of this text. The final conclusions and related future insights are presented. At last, this work is an invaluable resource for anyone involved in this field of study because it offers a comprehensive literary framework that can serve as the foundation for any future research on NRs and its prospective difficulties. Therefore, academics can use this framework to enhance previous formulations and approaches as well as suggest more effective models. © 2023, The Author(s)."
